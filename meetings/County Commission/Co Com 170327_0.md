| 0:03:30| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Sir, are you the operator of Sunrise Market on Tazewell Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=212)|
| 0:03:39| Yeah, I'm the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| You're the owner. Do you own the property or just the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| Property, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| Okay. You have been cited for a second offense. Do you realize that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| Third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| If the sheriff would please stand and give his testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=235)|
| 0:04:08| Okay. This was the third sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| I had one at 4-7 of 15, 4-18 of 16, and 3-9 of 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=251)|
| 0:04:19| Sunrise Market in Delhi, 8802 Tazewell Pike, 6-Pack Bud Light, Cairns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=259)|
| 0:04:30| Sir, did you hear the allegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Do you understand it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Do you have any testimony or do you admit or deny what the sheriff's deputy has said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| I totally admit with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| Okay. Do you have any testimony you would like to give this body before they examine your case on this third offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=281)|
| 0:04:49| I keep on trying to tell them to check everybody's ID and sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=289)|
| 0:04:55| But if they're just miscounting the date, I don't know what I'm supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| Because it's the third time they check the ID and they're just not checking the right date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| We have signs everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| Right in front of the cash register we have a digital sign which says exactly the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=308)|
| 0:05:14| Every time different people just keep selling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| This kind of situation I'm in, I don't know what I'm supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| Because if you ask him, she did check ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| Before also they did check ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| But when they're counting the dates, I don't know why they're missing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| I have my employee with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| She can tell you she's been with me for six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| We have other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| I never have this problem over there if you let her talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| If you would like her to testify as part of your statement to this commission, she's more than welcome to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| My name is Connie Self.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| As he said, I've been employed with him for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| I myself have been checked at this same location, 8802 Tazewell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| I passed mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| I guess I paid better attention, counted better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| I've also been checked for tobacco and passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| We do have signs up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| I trained this particular lady myself, and she was told repeatedly to card everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| check the picture, the expiration date, and the date of the birthday, and to make sure she had it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=383)|
| 0:06:30| She says she just miscounted that she did check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| But they are trained to card everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| They have been since I've been employed with these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| Is there anything else you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| I turn it over to the chairman for discussion by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| Commissioner Thomas, is that your line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| To be honest with you, this is what disturbs me is not taking the blame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| but saying we're doing everything, don't know what the solution is, we tried everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=427)|
| 0:07:15| If you can't, when you come down here and get a beer permit, it says you will be responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=435)|
| 0:07:22| and you will do everything to make sure you don't sell to underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| You need to figure out what it takes not to come back to us and say I'm doing everything I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| Obviously, you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| I have no sympathy for the fact of a third offense coming before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| and you saying we're doing all we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| Obviously, you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| How long does this person work for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| Four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| Four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| Was this the same person that was cited in the previous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| Do you train them internally, or do you send them out for training to somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| They went to training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| They went to training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| I guess this is what we all struggle with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| Driver's license underage, red stripe, has a date on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| This is not rocket science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| This is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| And I think they checked, I think, 30-something stores that night, 24-something stores that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=506)|
| 0:08:34| You're the only one that's a repeat customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| So there has to be a culture in that store to allow this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| Usually we do have a sign like that at my cash register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| And I don't know why they, I don't know what to say because I was not there present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| I seen on a tape that they did check the ID, but she said she didn't count the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=536)|
| 0:09:03| It's not about counting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| It's about looking at the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| You don't have to count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| It says right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Yeah, but she's supposed to do that, and she's been trained for a while with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| Now, the previous two employees that got caught, I mean, almost, you're almost hitting prom season every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| and I think that's, I mean, it's not hard to figure out they're going to come after you in prom season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=559)|
| 0:09:26| Are those two employees still with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| Is this employee still with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| She got fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| How many stores do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| I have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| And how many, has the other store been caught ever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| Union County, they caught me several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| Union County caught you several times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| Several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| They caught me, but, I mean, I didn't get charged for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| You have no violations in Union County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| No violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| You have any other violations in Knox County besides these three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| No other violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| I think Commissioner Anders pretty much asked most of my questions that I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=601)|
| 0:10:10| This is just right up the road from where I live, and I'm very concerned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=610)|
| 0:10:17| How is it that everybody comes down here saying they miscalculated the dates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=617)|
| 0:10:24| Is there not a red stripe on driver's license that indicates you are underage, that you cannot buy alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=624)|
| 0:10:37| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| I mean, so what is this about calculating dates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| There's no need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| There's no need to ever look at the date and figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| The red stripe is there for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| That's an excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| Yeah, but that's an excuse that this county commission is no longer going to even try to comprehend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=654)|
| 0:11:06| because that is an excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| The state has made it very clear on the driver's license, and if this – I'm beside myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=668)|
| 0:11:19| Have you been there when this has happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| Are all three times when you've never been there on the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| No, I was not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| And what – are you training your workers, or are they going to a professional training service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=689)|
| 0:11:39| My employees do train them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| My manager, she trains them, and we show them everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| She tells me that she miscalculated the date, and that's what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| Is Connie your manager that trains?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Would you care to come down to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| Are you familiar and do you know about the red stripe on the driver's license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| So what do you think is the difficult – I mean, that's just simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=726)|
| 0:12:14| If you can see the red stripe, you don't sell to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| And that's really about – that's about all I can really say in terms of training somebody to not serve or sell to someone underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=738)|
| 0:12:28| Do you stress that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Oh, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| They know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| That's what – I mean, there's no calculating that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| Maybe you need to have them go through a more professional training because this is very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=757)|
| 0:12:49| And, you know, I'm not taking any excuses in this, and, you know, anybody that's out there listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=769)|
| 0:12:57| this county commission is not going to take that we miscalculated the date wrong anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| So I'm going to – really, there's not much more to say except, you know, leave it to our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=782)|
| 0:13:16| I believe that Commissioner Smith was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| I just gave a conflicting answer to me and Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| So, number one, I want to remind you you're under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| And number two, I asked you if you sent them out to be trained and you said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| She asked if you were sent out to be trained and you said they're trained in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| Which is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| I want to remind you again, you're under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| Whenever I'm at the store, I show her to, and she was the one trained to work with her while she was working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=819)|
| 0:13:47| So your employee had not been to the task class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| She'd been to the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| The one that was cited had been to the task class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| You're not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| Okay, May, do you know if the server cited had been to the task class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Is she required to be at the task class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| I think she ought to be within 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| He said she'd been employed for four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| I'd like to make a motion we set this off until the next beer board meeting to allow evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| or to see if she has had a task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| If not, you're operating outside of your beer permit, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| The question that's being asked is, has the person been trained by a certified trainer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=869)|
| 0:14:37| whether it be in-house or sent out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| The training has to be done by someone who is certified to train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| And we do not have we're not being presented with that information today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| unless someone can present that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| We trained her and we told her to go to the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| So she said she did go to class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| Do you have the certificate, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| Do you keep the certificate on file?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| I cannot get it from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| Then I think the motion is properly before us pending the receipt of additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=912)|
| 0:15:22| We cannot render a decision today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| We would have to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| Go ahead, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| Well, if we do defer this, I have a real problem allowing him to continue to sell for 30 more days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=932)|
| 0:15:45| And I find it very unlikely, I mean, unless they give him that information from the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=945)|
| 0:15:53| this employee's name, that he will be able to contact this employee and say bring this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| He's supposed to keep it on file at the store, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| So if he don't have it on file at the store, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Could I get you to hold your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| I'll withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| The motion is currently withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Sir, you stated that you are doing all the training you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| Woofie, sir, this was three times, I believe, in my calculation in less than three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=979)|
| 0:16:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| And those are the only three times you have checked this store in those three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| Have you ever heard of prevention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| And that is where you hire somebody to go around and check and make sure your employees are doing their job right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| I think after the first, the second time, that's something you need to look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| There's a couple of companies here in town I think do it, or you can do it yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| Just send somebody in to try and buy beer and see if your employees are doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1013)|
| 0:17:00| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| I make a motion that we pull this license until all the requirements are met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| and it's been presented to the clerk and are satisfactory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| Do you wish to say more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| No, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| Well, I think that limits us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| I agree with the motion, and that limits us the ability of what we can do after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| And so once you take this action, he gets everything in compliance because she's no longer an employee there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| so he doesn't have to have it on file anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| So I think in a suspension with him coming into compliance is the end goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| My point is that his license would be suspended until he meets all the requirements at his business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1065)|
| 0:17:53| for us to consider him getting his license back, including a fine for the last times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1073)|
| 0:18:03| Is that legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| Is it illegal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Yes, you have the authority to suspend that license, to revoke it, and to suspend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| And if he wants to get back in the game, he needs to pay whatever you levy on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1094)|
| 0:18:25| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| I guess this is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Since I'm the newbie, give me the regulations or rules that we need to follow as being a third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1109)|
| 0:18:39| If we do suspend his license, is that for one year, two years, ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| What are the rules that we need to go by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| You have the absolute authority to suspend or revoke, period, to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| First offense, second offense, third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| You can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Normally what this body has done is give the options, either pay a fine of, in this case, maybe $2,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1134)|
| 0:19:03| and or a suspension for a limited amount of time, or you can suspend or revoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| I mean, you've got all of that power under your code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1149)|
| 0:19:16| Mr. Chairman, my motion is to suspend the license completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| until the owner provides the information that the commission is requesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| and at that time we will levy a fine for his third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| If he doesn't provide it satisfactorily, then the license stays revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| Not revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| Suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Yeah, suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| I need to ask another question that was brought up right here, and we have not addressed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| If he cannot produce where she went to the training, and he said she did have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1192)|
| 0:20:01| and he made some other statements that we're not sure that are true or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| but it seems like he did swear an oath that he was telling the truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1206)|
| 0:20:13| what options do we have if we find that he has been less than truthful with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1213)|
| 0:20:24| What this body has is you weigh the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| You listen to witnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| You determine whether they're truthful or not truthful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| You put that all into, just like a jury would, into the whole box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| and then you decide based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| As far as whether or not there's a statement that was knowingly untrue under oath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1240)|
| 0:20:47| that's a separate item that would fall under a potential criminal offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| but you don't have to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| You're the fact finder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| Would the maker of the motion consider a time frame, say 90 days, that the license be suspended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1260)|
| 0:21:08| and then he appear after 90 days with his appropriate information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1268)|
| 0:21:17| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| When he appears with the appropriate information, if it meets our satisfaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| we're going to levy a fine at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| I understand that, but his license is revoked for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| Suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Suspended, excuse me, for 90 days, and at that point he appears back to the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| He can come back any time he gets his paperwork together, but his license is suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| It may be 120 days, may be forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Now, I'll be glad to entertain that if the commissioner wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| Well, I was going to make the same suggestion because I think in 2009 we levied 120 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| and the judge knocked it down to 93 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| and I think this would be so open-ended I think it would get knocked down and put a number on it as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| and that was going to be my suggestion as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| I see exactly what Ed's trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| He doesn't want this business to continue to sell beer until we know exactly what is going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1333)|
| 0:22:20| and how to assess a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| So, Brad, were you saying 120 days, 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1343)|
| 0:22:30| We had one get knocked down by Chancellor Moyers for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| It was excessive, and I can't remember if it was 93.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| The appeal was heard on the 93rd day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| What about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| What if we do it for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| If he's not back here with his paperwork in line in 30 days, we can suspend it again for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| I think you're complicating the legal matter there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| And you can do 90 days and a $2,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| There's nothing to stop you from doing that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| But would that keep us from leveling an even harsher fine at the end of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1378)|
| 0:23:05| That would be the fine, and that would be the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| Let me back this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| At some point in time here, the days of suspension and fine that should be in the final motion we beat out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1390)|
| 0:23:20| should be 180 days or $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1400)|
| 0:23:28| Well, I don't like the or part because they'll pay the $2,500 and go ahead and sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| Am I sorry, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| Not if it's suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| And I think we need to suspend this man's license because he is not doing what he's supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1416)|
| 0:23:44| Third time, every time they go out there, it's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| As a matter of fact, maybe we should just revoke his license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| But it just doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| I mean, he's selling beer to kids out there over and over and over, and we're trying to be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| He ain't being fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| You should not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| I think this is Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| Okay, so Ed and I run on the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| If we suspend his license for 30 days for him to come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1457)|
| 0:24:25| appear before us to show any proof about his server because he just said under oath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| that she went to this training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| And they should have proof if she did or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| So even at that time, if we suspend it for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| then are we locked in to not being able to revoke it 30 days from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1484)|
| 0:24:52| or suspend it for another 90 days with a fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| I mean, Ed and I are both like, okay, I do not want this man to be allowed to sell any more alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1496)|
| 0:25:08| until we come about our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| So if we find out in 30 days, I mean, in 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| he should know whether or not his server went to that training or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| Does it make any difference if the server went or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| They're still selling beer over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| No, except that it might mean that he told us something that wasn't true under oath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| which I consider very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| And then at that time, we can decide if we ever want to just suspend or if we just want to revoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1536)|
| 0:25:45| I mean, if he's saying his employee really went to that training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| I mean, he's already breaking the law because he should have had that on file at his store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| I think we're kind of really at a sense of forgetting all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| He's done this three times, and we either take it very seriously and revoke the license today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1562)|
| 0:26:11| or suspend and do the fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| unless we want to take it, you know, a little further by if he said his server went to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| and she didn't, then he told us, I mean, you know, and I don't know that we want to go there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| because all of it really, our main thing is to make sure these stores do not sell to underage kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1586)|
| 0:26:34| Let's pause for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| Mr. Mays speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1596)|
| 0:26:47| He stated that the person that sold the beer no longer works for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| and so he probably won't have any type of paperwork on her as far as in the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1612)|
| 0:27:01| Yeah, that's what I said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| So the task force doesn't keep that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| That's what I was trying to ask before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| I didn't think he could get that from that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| So if he doesn't have it at his store, then is there any way of getting that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1632)|
| 0:27:21| The service card goes with the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| So she leaves, he leaves, and goes to another store, and they've got their server ID card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1644)|
| 0:27:31| Is there no record of them taking the class, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| If you knew which class they took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| Can we have Connie come back to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1657)|
| 0:27:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| Because I asked you and you said that you were the one that trained her, him or her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| Her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| Her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| So are you certified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| Have you been through this task class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| And do you know, did you send her on to take an additional class, or was it just what you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1680)|
| 0:28:08| She told me she had her server's license, that she had been through the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| Commissioner Caringer, let's pause for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| The question you're asking is mixing terms a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| She, Connie, does train,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| but the certified part, as testified to by the owner, was done by a certified outside trainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1702)|
| 0:28:31| Well, but I asked her if she had trained her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| Trained her to the store standards, but not for the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| Yes, to the store standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| But not to the certified server standard as required by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| Have you been through the server's training yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| A few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| So you have your card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| I do somewhere, ma'am, but I don't know where it's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| It's been a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| I need a number on the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| A few years, I have 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1743)|
| 0:29:10| Server cards are good for three years, so you're outside the limits also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1750)|
| 0:29:18| I think I know where it's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| Caringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| If the maker of the original motion is not prepared to put a time frame on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| I would like to make a substitute motion then that we suspend this business's beer license for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1770)|
| 0:29:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Okay with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| I withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| The motion that's on the floor is for a 90-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Continuing discussion, I believe it's Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1789)|
| 0:29:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| There's two issues we've got going here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| First of all, we've got the illegal sale of alcoholic beverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| Now we find out that we've got a card, the server, that does not have an up-to-date card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| That's additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| But the other issue we've got that we're going to have to deal with is about the truthfulness of the information we've got, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1814)|
| 0:30:22| and that's now we've got three issues with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| Now, how do we need to handle one and then say have the other one come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1826)|
| 0:30:35| and let us know if he was really telling us the truth that they had the card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| I think that's important because we let people come in here and give us all kinds of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| If they're not telling the truth, there's got to be some sort of retribution to that kind of statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| That, as given by the law enforcement, is going to be a difficult procedure to find out because we do not know who trained them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1853)|
| 0:31:02| So dealing with all of this in one bucket is going to be the way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| I believe it's Carson Daly, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Officer Wolfie said there was a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| The owner accepted the violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| We need to revoke or suspend his license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| I don't say 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| I say for six months at the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| He admitted the violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| It has nothing to do with cards or dates or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| It's a violation, and that's what we need to discuss, the violation only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| I would suggest suspension be even longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| I believe that it's Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Commissioner, Law Director, can we suspend the location so he can't go and change business tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| Can we suspend the location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| I know we can revoke the location, but can we suspend the location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1911)|
| 0:31:59| Suspension would follow the place and the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| So this address can't get a beer permit for this 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| I don't want him to turn around and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| He can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| He can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| So he can sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| He can sell the business and apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| But it has to be a legitimate sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| And our memory might be good for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| It will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| Let me ask Commissioner Anders, because we were talking about if he's operating correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1949)|
| 0:32:36| with the task force and all the training that they go, isn't his manager supposed to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1956)|
| 0:32:45| He has to come into compliance to get his license back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| He'll have to come into full compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| Essentially, he is now out of compliance and has been because she's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| That's what I wanted to make clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| To get his license back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| It does have to do, I mean, it does matter who has serving cards and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| because then they're not operating in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| He will have to come into full compliance to get his license back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| Seeing no further discussion, the motion before us is for a 90-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=1991)|
| 0:33:26| Can we do a fine with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| Captain Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| Captain Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| If you'll suspend, then the beer companies have to come and remove everything that's alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2017)|
| 0:33:48| The motion that's properly before us is for a 90-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| Mr. Judah, just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| Captain Mays, does the owner call the distributor or do we, Knox County, have to notify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2046)|
| 0:34:15| I'll call them tomorrow morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| The call will be made from the desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| If he wants to reapply after tonight, he can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2059)|
| 0:34:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| Mr. Judah, you have been suspended from the sale of beer in Knox County for 90 days at Sunrise Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2077)|
| 0:34:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| Shell Gas Station 7135 Clinton Highway, Deva Corporation, owner's second offense, District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2091)|
| 0:35:04| Good afternoon. T. Scott Jones for Shell Corporation and Don Patel of the Deva Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2104)|
| 0:35:12| And we accept responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| And his name is, again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| Don Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| Actually, Dermindra Patel, but his short name is Don Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| I can spell that if you'd like or have him spell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| You're represented by a very able counsel here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| so we'll go right in to Captain May come up and give his testimony with regard to his second offense at this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2133)|
| 0:35:46| On March 9, 2017, at an underage beer sale at the Shell 7135 Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2146)|
| 0:35:57| Bud Light bottles, and there was no check of the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| And the person that got the citation stated, I know you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2163)|
| 0:36:13| Okay, Mr. Jones, you have your client there, and you can ask him whatever questions you'd like and then argue his case for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2173)|
| 0:36:20| Your name is Don Patel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| Shell Gas Station located at 7135 Clinton Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| And the employee in question is a gentleman by the name of Raxit Patel, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| And you reviewed this matter, and in order to prevent this type of activity occurring when you're not in the station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| what specific system have you put in as a point of sale program now to stop this from happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| The Shell has required to put the new system in around six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| So Shell put the new system, and we have a touch screen with the TOPA system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| So the Shell was working because they have a cheap system and everything going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| So I had my location, the guy bypassed the date, so I called Verizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2223)|
| 0:37:11| Shell has another company operated by Verizon, so I called Verizon and I locked it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| So now any employer cannot sell the beer without they can put the date now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2237)|
| 0:37:25| And so what you're saying is you had the system installed commensurate with the direction that you had from Shell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| but evidently that employee had figured out a way to override that system, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| You have now subsequently put software in place, albeit a human could theoretically lie to the machine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2257)|
| 0:37:44| but they have to actually enter in a birthday before it will allow a transaction, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Before they can press the enter and bypass the birthday, but now they cannot bypass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| They have to be put the birthday now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| And that being said, this occurred on an occasion with a fairly short term and new employee, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| And actually you primarily run the store, but you were attending a funeral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| and you regret the circumstances and accept responsibility because you're the owner of the store, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| And he did mistake, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| And, in fact, the first offense actually occurred back in April of 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| so we were almost at the three-year point, not to make excuses with regards to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| but it is not your intention to intentionally sell beer and you have no intention of selling beer to minors, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2307)|
| 0:38:33| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| And I already sent a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| He did have him take the appropriate class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| I guess one question, Scott, or Mr. Jones, is the employee that sold the beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| had he taken the class at the time of employment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| My understanding that he had, and then they also spoke to, and forgive me because I don't know everybody's name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2332)|
| 0:38:58| when he talked to someone at the beer board and they were directed to take another class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| and he has taken that additional class, and I have proof of that, as well as the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| because he received a citation, I'm talking about the individual employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| and he is also being required to take a KPD-provided class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| I did not represent him in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| I'm representing Mr. Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| That employee evidently went and basically was disciplined through the court system there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| and so it's my understanding he's also having to take the KPD class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| But I'll be glad to show this to Wolfie, but I do have it dated from the Top Shelf Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2368)|
| 0:39:35| I'll go ahead and make a motion for a, I think it's a 60, what is the second offense, 60 days and $1,000, $1,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2375)|
| 0:39:43| $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| So I'll make a motion for a $1,000 fine or a 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| Motion is properly before us and seeing no further discussion for a 60-day suspension or $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2395)|
| 0:40:11| Go ahead, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| Point of clarification, when it's been a 30-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| Make sure we know where we're standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| Seeing the light, we're having further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| Typically, if we do a 30-day suspension, we do a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| So if we're doing a 60-day suspension or the fine should be larger than $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2430)|
| 0:40:38| Yeah, the first offense is now $1,000, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| So I'll amend my motion to $1,500, but I do want to let you know that the third offense is possible revocation for one year at your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2441)|
| 0:40:49| We watched what occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| We were very, very cognizant of that, but we did also want to reassure we had done all we could, no excuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2451)|
| 0:40:58| but to put an additional block on the software where, theoretically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| that computer and that machine will not allow you to sell beer if you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| Now, that's not going to stop the individual from lying to the machine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| and I get a malicious employee could theoretically do that, but it is another step to prevent that from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2469)|
| 0:41:17| So it's $1,500, $1,500, and $1,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| Restate that, Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| $1,500 and $1,600 instead of $1,000 and $1,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| Or $1,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| And the second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| I just wanted to bring up again, we all sound like broken records about the red stripe on driver's license for underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2498)|
| 0:41:49| This is very easy to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| So can you reemphasize, if there's a red stripe on there, they do not sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2512)|
| 0:42:01| So I very much appreciate what you're doing and the steps you've gone to and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2521)|
| 0:42:10| and we certainly don't want to see you back up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| But if you could stress that red stripe on the driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2536)|

| 0:44:08| is that Officer May will give his statement as to what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2648)|

| 0:44:17| and you'll have a chance to explain whatever you want to explain to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| Captain May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| On March 9, 2017, I did an underage beer sting at 7603 Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2667)|
| 0:44:35| the Dollar General Store, and purchased a six-pack Bud Light bottle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| The clerk did check ID and still sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2682)|
| 0:44:49| You may now state your position, whether, first of all, do you admit or deny the allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| I admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| And now you can explain however you want to to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| The employee has had training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| She's had the CBLs, which is our company-based learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| where she sits in front of a computer and basically watches a video and acknowledges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| She took that back on October 4, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| And then previous before that, when we first got our beer license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| which was earlier in that year, 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| where we had a certified person come to the store, and she took the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| But she no longer works for the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| She's terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| But, I mean, other than that, she basically says she typed the ID in wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| I mean, she says she made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| But, I mean, you know, what I'm doing to basically try to counter this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| all my employees are going to retake the CBL,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| and, of course, all the current new employees take it when they get hired on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| So I am required to take a task training class, which I did this past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| I do every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| I did this past summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| But basically that's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2769)|

| 0:47:08| The $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=2828)|

| 0:58:40| Why don't I just tell you what's in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| You tell us what's in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| Nobody wants to hear me that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| I can — I hear that at home quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| So this is Fair Housing Month, and I'll just read the enacting clause and the final clause on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3528)|
| 0:58:55| Whereas Congress of the United States of America passed the Fair Housing Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| that's the Title 8 Civil Rights Act of 1968, which guarantees the rights of individuals to equal housing opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3540)|
| 0:59:09| And the month of April is recognized by the federal, state, and local governments as Fair Housing Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| And we support that, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| This is the mayor of Knox County supports fairness and equal opportunities in housing throughout Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3556)|
| 0:59:21| to ensure our community's positive and successful social, cultural, economic growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| Now, therefore, I, Tim Burchett, Knox County mayor, hereby proclaim April 2017 as Fair Housing Month in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3566)|
| 0:59:34| And, of course, we have our folks down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| We — I guess we take it for granted we've got a warm place to live, but these people make sure that it happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3576)|
| 0:59:42| and they make sure it's done in a fair way and there's no discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| And I want to thank them, all these fine folks, for the great work they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| They shake the money tree in Washington, and they make things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| So I just want to thank them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3596)|
| 1:00:03| Hold on just a second. We need a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| And, Mayor Burchett, if you would please pause with me there for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| We need to go on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| Thank you for the Fair Housing Month proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| I'd also —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| I'd like to call on former Commissioner Ed Schaust, Mr. Ed Schaust, the current Knox County trustee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3620)|
| 1:00:30| to come up to the podium and say a few words about Fair Housing Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| I'd like to call on former Commissioner Ed Schaust, Mr. Ed Schaust, the current Knox County trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3639)|
| 1:00:51| Ed, you're —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| I'm honored to attend one of my favorite meetings in the whole world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3653)|
| 1:01:00| Seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3660)|
| 1:01:01| Enjoyed my six years on county commission immensely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| About eight or nine months ago, I was out at a Knoxville Heritage lunch at Westwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| the mansion there at Kingston, Pike, and Cherokee Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| and overheard — I wasn't eavesdropping, but overheard a conversation between Vice Mayor —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| City Vice Mayor Duane Greve and a young lady named Joan Easterly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| and they were making a —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| embroidering the Knoxville —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| embroidering — let me get this exactly —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| the Embroiderers Guild was making a Knoxville seal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| and were presenting it to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| And one thing led to another, and we started a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| and they began, at that point or shortly thereafter, making something to give to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3700)|
| 1:01:47| And they came up with the idea — of course, we have a seal, and we see it very prominently displayed —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| but they came up with the idea of an embroidering of the old Knox County Courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| And they have worked tirelessly on that for nine months now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| and the lady I met that day, Joan Easterly, who was past president of the guild,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| and also the museum house committee, Meredith Lemon and Deborah Mead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| are here with me to present this embroidering of the old Knox County Courthouse to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3733)|
| 1:02:20| and to Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| I'll ask him to come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| On behalf of the Knoxville chapter of the Embroiderers Guild of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| we present this hand-stitched picture of the old Knox County Courthouse to Mayor Tim Burchett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3753)|
| 1:02:40| to accept for public display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| This gift is one of 39 landmarks of the Knoxville area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| that the Embroiderers Guild has charted into county cross-stitch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3767)|
| 1:02:54| as part of our work with other museum houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| The Embroiderers Guild also supports community activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| such as the Fantasy of Trees, the Symphony Guild, Girl Scouts, and Knox Preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3782)|
| 1:03:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3790)|
| 1:03:34| Mr. Chairman, I was just going to say this will be on permanent display at 501 Princeton Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3814)|
| 1:03:41| Ms. Sheehan, Ms. Sheehan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3821)|
| 1:03:49| I just wanted to verify that I had your name correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| Deborah Mead with an E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| Oh, Deborah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3834)|

| 1:04:00| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| Thank you, Chairman, and thank you very much, ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| Thank you for connecting them with us, Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3847)|
| 1:04:14| I was on the next line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| Patrick Sheehan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3857)|

| 1:04:39| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| And your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| My name is Patrick Sheehan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| I am the Director of the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| Do you have a presentation to acknowledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| I have a presenting to the Knox County Rural Metro Fire Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3893)|
| 1:05:00| from the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| The type recognition and certification is a Type 2 Hazardous Materials Team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| So I'm honored to present the Knox County Rural Metro Fire Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| with this Type 2 Hazardous Materials Entry-Level Team certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| in recognition of the department's meeting the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| specified in the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| Hazardous Materials Team certification guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| I commend them for their hard work and their dedication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| not just to the tactical and operational needs and requirements of the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| but also to meeting all of the stringent administrative requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| and placing themselves to be evaluated by their peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| who have determined that they meet these criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| and are better prepared to make sure that Knox County has the capabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3943)|
| 1:05:48| to meet hazardous materials, any event for hazardous materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| So it's my honor to present this to Chief Harnish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3957)|
| 1:06:14| Chief Harnish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| Commissioner Wright, I know you've got a full agenda today, so I'll keep it brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| We're extremely grateful to Director Sheehan and his team for the time they spent with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| More importantly, though, extremely proud to be living in the safest community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| in Tennessee and maybe in the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| This is a community achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| It's not my achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| But I do want to recognize the men and women who've come here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| who personally were responsible for accomplishing this on behalf of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| Have them stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| Take a stand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4011)|

| 1:07:18| Ms. Vivian Scheib.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4038)|
| 1:07:25| To speak now or do you wish to speak when we have the behavioral center discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4045)|
| 1:07:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4053)|
| 1:07:48| Commissioner Anders, the Community Health Council, you're right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4068)|
| 1:07:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| Captain Thomas, if you'll come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| This is the Community Health Council's annual report to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| Captain Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| My name is Eve Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| I live at 3703 River Trace Boulevard in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| And I am here tonight in my role as the upcoming chair of the Community Health Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| just to update you on what we have done over the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| We actually serve the city of Knoxville, Knox County, and the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| In the spring of 2016, we released our Community Health Improvement Plan, or CHIP as we call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4104)|
| 1:08:30| And this plan is a roadmap for improving four priority health issues in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| the four of them being mental health, opioid abuse, tobacco use, and active living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| The council has partnered with four new and existing groups to draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| and implement action plans to address these four issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| And this work has been ongoing through this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| Right now, the four groups are working on the prevention and education around those priority issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4130)|
| 1:08:56| Some groups are actually working to bridge gaps in data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| or to coordinate law enforcement issues or to align state policy with local priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4139)|
| 1:09:06| You've been passed out a summary of those action plans, and they're pretty self-explanatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| I'm not going to go through them all, and I'll let you all read through those at your leisure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| If you have questions, you can check healthyknox.org| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| or contact us at our email address, knoxchc.gmail.com,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| or I'll be more than happy to come back and address any issues if you have any in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4162)|
| 1:09:28| Lastly, I'm excited also to report that the United Way of Greater Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| has integrated these four health priority issues into the current health grant cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| As we see more and more alignment around a common sense of priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| the Health Council expects to see improvements in our community's health, which is our overall goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4182)|
| 1:09:48| And we'll be back to update you periodically, hopefully at least on an annual basis or as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| Would anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| Seeing no questions, I appreciate your coming to give us a brief overview this afternoon, Ms. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| Thank you. I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4206)|

| 1:11:21| because that will be an hour and a half that we've been in our seats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| and that will give us an hour and a half until zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4284)|
| 1:11:29| The next thing that we have on our agenda is consideration of Resolution 17-3-104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4289)|
| 1:11:41| This is consideration of a resolution of commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| honoring the Central High School football team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4305)|

| 1:12:00| Commissioner Carringer, would you get them in formation while this is being read?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4320)|
| 1:12:05| Whereas the Central High School football team recently advanced to its first state championship game since 1999,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4325)|
| 1:12:12| and whereas in December the Central High School football team played in the Class 4A state football championship game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4332)|
| 1:12:19| but fell short against Memphis East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| and whereas to reach the championship game Central prevailed over Greenville in the second round| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4344)|
| 1:12:30| with a win in the last seconds of the game, defeated Fulton in the quarterfinals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4350)|
| 1:12:36| and successfully fought a comeback against Marshall County in the semifinals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| and whereas the Central High School football team finished this season with a stellar 12-3 record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4361)|
| 1:12:47| and whereas Head Coach Bryson Rosser provided the leadership and direction of the team's successful season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4367)|
| 1:12:53| and whereas the Central High School football team's hard work, talent, teamwork, and perseverance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4373)|
| 1:12:58| were all contributing factors to their winning season that accumulated their appearance in the state championship game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4378)|
| 1:13:05| now therefore be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| The Commission of Knox County hereby honors and congratulates the Central High School football team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4389)|

| 1:13:22| Be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to the Central High School football team and Coach Bryson Rosser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4402)|

| 1:13:43| Yes, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| It is with great honor that I stand here today to represent the Central High School football team under the direction of Coach Rosser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4426)|
| 1:13:56| We are very honored to have him, not only at Central High School, but just to have him involved in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4436)|
| 1:14:07| His parents were educators, and he has got some really good stories about education and about playing sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4447)|
| 1:14:17| I just want to say congratulations, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| We are all so proud of you all in Knox County, and mostly I'm a Central High School alumni,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4462)|
| 1:14:29| so the alumni is very proud of you all bringing our pride and tradition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| I represent Fulton High School and Central High School, and so I think I represent the two best high schools in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4475)|
| 1:14:43| So at this time, I want to let Coach Rosser say a few words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| and I would welcome all of you all to get to know Coach Rosser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| and anything that you all would like to do to support Central High School Bobcats, we'd be grateful for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4494)|
| 1:15:03| Thank you. I just wanted to say we're honored and humbled to be here to accept this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| It's really hard to get kids what you really want them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| It's even more great to watch them do what they really love to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| and these young men really love to play the game of football, and they love to be student-athletes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| They do their fair share of community service hours through mentoring programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| We're involved in the Tennessee Alzheimer's Walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| There's just so many things that show what these young men are really about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| and football is just another way for them to show who they really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| So I'm extremely honored and humbled to be their coach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| and I just want to say thank you to all the parents and the teachers and everybody at Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| It's definitely our honor to represent them in this way and to be down in Coquitlam at the state championship game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4543)|
| 1:15:49| and it's our plan to get back to that game and hopefully take it next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| So thank you very much again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4552)|

| 1:16:08| You all may all know who is Carol Mitchell, the famous softball coach at Gibbs High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4568)|
| 1:16:16| I've just embarrassed him to death, but he was our quarterback this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| and I'm glad you mentioned because that was one important thing I wanted to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| Not just athletics, but Coach Rosser and his staff push for academics and for community service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4586)|
| 1:16:35| and we have already seen a big difference in the area and in the school with encouraging these young men to go out and do community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4595)|
| 1:16:45| They're over at Gresham Middle School doing tutoring before school even starts, like what, about 7.30, 7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4605)|
| 1:16:53| And so we're just very thankful, and also we have the Central High School football cheerleading coach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4613)|
| 1:17:01| Jackie Raley, sitting right here behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4621)|

| 1:21:55| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| The reason that we're going to discuss this one item transfer is because it is new today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4917)|
| 1:22:03| All others have been before us for the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| You emailed an additional line item transfer today that has to do with a budget transfer from a road project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4929)|
| 1:22:21| over to a radio capital project in the amount of $2.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4941)|
| 1:22:30| What this is in relation to is in the FY18 budget, we've been working through E911 with the Sheriff's Office about putting in digital radios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4950)|
| 1:22:44| And in doing so, the total cost was like $2.3 million, and we were going to include that in the 18 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4964)|
| 1:22:51| And the Sheriff's Office has worked with Motorola and had already received about $375,000 in discounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4971)|
| 1:22:58| Well, they said if we could issue a PO by the end of March, we could receive another discount of $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4978)|
| 1:23:06| And so what we did was we have put before you a line item transfer that would set up this new OR code for the radios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4986)|
| 1:23:16| appropriate the money and the funding for the radio so procurement can issue a PO against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=4996)|
| 1:23:24| and then we will receive an additional $100,000 of a discount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| And then you will replenish that with the budget that will be passed for FY18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5010)|
| 1:23:37| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| I was just going to make sure we were going to replenish the road fund. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5018)|

| 1:24:36| We will take a five-minute recess and return at the sound of the gavel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5076)|
| 1:25:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5106)|
| 1:25:36| Thank you, Commissioner Gill. Did you bring us Girl Scout cookies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5136)|
| 1:25:40| Commissioner Carringer did, but we share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5140)|
| 1:25:46| Thank you, my fellow commissioners, for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5146)|
| 1:25:51| Madam Clerk, would you please read Resolution 408 on page 13?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5151)|
| 1:25:58| With consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, approving an inter-local agreement between Knox County, the City of Knoxville, and the Town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5158)|
| 1:26:07| to jointly participate in the required update to the Local Hazard Mitigation Plan, Resolution 408.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5167)|
| 1:26:14| Mr. Vandevee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is the agreement we discussed last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| This is a required update to our Hazard Mitigation Plan, and it has implications for our standing in the community rating system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5181)|
| 1:26:27| for our ability to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program, and a variety of other federal programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5187)|
| 1:26:34| We're just particularly appreciative that the City of Knoxville and the Town of Farragut have opted to cost-share in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5194)|
| 1:26:40| and would also want to thank Daniel Sanders in the Law Director's Office for his expeditious turnaround of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5200)|
| 1:26:48| This is a good agreement. It will serve us well, and we'd ask approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| Motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5222)|

| 1:27:06| Thank you, Mr. Vandevee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| I'm going to pause this for just one more moment, for a moment or two, because I'm eyeballing a couple of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5230)|
| 1:27:16| who are standing very, very close to the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| I wish you'd come over here, both of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| Both of you, chop-chop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5242)|
| 1:27:29| There will be no loitering at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| I know the door is where you stand when you want to get away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| This is a very special occasion when you can have two people stand before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5258)|
| 1:27:44| both Thomases, one that wants to be called Buzz, Dr. Bob,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5264)|
| 1:27:54| and one who wants to be called plain old Bob, Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5274)|
| 1:28:00| But the reason that I've brought you both here before us is to congratulate you on the job that you've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5280)|
| 1:28:08| and look forward to the job that I know you can get done over the next several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5288)|
| 1:28:14| And then one last thing is that it is no longer plain old Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5294)|
| 1:28:21| It's super Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5301)|
| 1:28:32| Do either of you wish to make a word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| I, of course, know all the commissioners and enjoyed a great working relationship with commissioners over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5318)|
| 1:28:45| and I look forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| I know what your challenges are, and you do a great job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| and I just look forward to working with each one of you in this new role that I will be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5331)|
| 1:28:57| So we've got about three things in mind, and that's increased student achievement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| it's to build a positive culture, and it's to eliminate disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| So I'll sound like a broken record until all those three things are done to everyone's satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5344)|
| 1:29:11| And we want to provide the very best education possible to our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| and we're going to work really hard to do that over the next however long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5355)|
| 1:29:22| Thank you, Super Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| Yes, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| Mr. Chair, I also wanted to thank you all for your support, not just to Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5368)|
| 1:29:35| but a great skills partnership, and I look forward to continuing to work with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5379)|

| 1:30:08| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| This evening has been a little hectic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| in that we haven't had time to see where people wanted to be in the order of speaking tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5413)|
| 1:30:20| This item is brought to us by County Mayor and Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5420)|
| 1:30:28| Mr. Mayor, do you wish to speak, or Sheriff Jones, do you wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5428)|
| 1:30:38| What we have before us is a resolution to approve a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5438)|
| 1:30:45| I have several people who wish to speak on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5445)|
| 1:30:55| Who was it that I called on a moment ago? I've lost my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| Ms. Vivian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5460)|
| 1:31:19| She says she's going to get a titanium piece to fix that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5479)|
| 1:31:24| but then she'll have to have a pass to get through the airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| I would like to ask you for your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| Vivian Underwood-Shy, 109 South Gallaher View Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5493)|
| 1:31:39| And then I'd also like you to notice that we have five minutes that I'd like to hear your comments within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5499)|
| 1:31:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| I would ask those that are here that are in support of the safety center just to stand as I read my statement, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| There are many that have come out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| Tonight is the culmination of eight years of work, prayer, and preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| God's word says to everything there is a season and a time for every purpose under the heavens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5521)|
| 1:32:07| This is the season of building up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| In this right now moment, when you, the commissioners of Knox County, vote on the space that will house the safety center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5530)|
| 1:32:17| you will be doing a great work, greater than you can even imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5537)|
| 1:32:22| You'll be raising a standard that the rest of the state and the country can follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| Right now, across this state, there are plans to open up such pre-arrest diversion centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5548)|
| 1:32:34| On the federal level, new laws have been passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| Step Up Together and other collaborative efforts are being made to help the mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| As you step forward into a leadership role to help the voiceless, this will be your earthly legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5563)|
| 1:32:51| You will be raising and restoring the lives of those who are treated as the least of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5571)|
| 1:32:58| Our voiceless citizens who have spent years wandering lost, under bridges, in and out of jails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5578)|
| 1:33:06| unable to help themselves because the illness they suffer from does not allow them to know that they are ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5586)|
| 1:33:13| You will be restoring your fellow citizens, citizens who have fought for this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5593)|
| 1:33:18| and by the terrible things they experienced have lost their way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| Citizens of this community who have suffered from onset mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5602)|
| 1:33:27| those who are duly diagnosed due to having to try to care for themselves, to fight pain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5607)|
| 1:33:32| they cannot control alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| You will be restoring families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| You will be restoring souls, the mind, the will, the emotions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5617)|
| 1:33:43| And it's going to be done step by step and it's going to be done one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5623)|
| 1:33:48| You will also be storing up for yourselves treasures in heaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| This will be your spiritual legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| This is the true treasure you will have done because you will have done the other part of what you were put in your office to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5636)|
| 1:34:04| You have been meeting the fiscal responsibilities of your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| Now, in supporting this center, you will meet the moral responsibilities that go along with that moment of silence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5647)|
| 1:34:14| that you take every time you open a meeting as you acknowledge a higher power that governs this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5654)|
| 1:34:21| Your true legacy, the one that really matters, is what you do for your fellow man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5661)|
| 1:34:27| I thank you for the years and the efforts you have put in with the studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5667)|
| 1:34:32| the collaboration with other agencies, the task force, and the money set aside for such a center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5672)|
| 1:34:39| As I take my seat, I have a word for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| We are all going to leave this earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| All that we have built up and shall create shall be left behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| Know this as you stand before the Lord and receive your crown and your treasures that are laid up for you in heaven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5691)|
| 1:34:59| by the things that you have done for your fellow man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| Do not be surprised by all the treasures you are going to receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| For the king shall answer and say unto you, I assure you and I most solemnly say to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5708)|
| 1:35:16| to the extent that you did it for one of these brothers of mine, even the least of them, you did it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5716)|
| 1:35:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5724)|

| 1:35:43| Ma'am, I'd like to remind you that it's five minutes, but please try to add to the conversation new information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5743)|
| 1:35:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| My name is Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| I live at 4221 Chinquapin Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5760)|
| 1:36:06| Some of you folks on the commission I know from the experience I had working for Knox County for 15 years or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5766)|
| 1:36:16| Some I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| I did send you all an e-mail this afternoon that I would like to make a matter of public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5778)|
| 1:36:26| If that's okay with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| While I've been out of town, I've been following the progress of the proposed Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5789)|
| 1:36:36| Thanks to community television of Knoxville and the MPC website, I have seen the March 2, 2017 community meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5796)|
| 1:36:45| the MPC meeting of March 9, and the commission workshop of March 20, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5805)|
| 1:36:52| May I recommend if you haven't already done so or were in attendance at any or all of these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5812)|
| 1:36:57| you take a fresh look at them before the commission meeting on March 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5817)|
| 1:37:03| At the commission workshop, many thoughtful questions were raised by commissioners, and many, I think, other folks do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5823)|
| 1:37:14| It's our intention responses were offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| I submit that unless these responses are written into the contract, they probably won't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5839)|
| 1:37:27| The commission and the citizens affected are being asked to accept the promises of a lame duck mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5847)|
| 1:37:34| a lame duck sheriff, and an organization that, regardless of how well-intentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5854)|
| 1:37:41| is notorious for seeking the point of least resistance to achieve their goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5861)|
| 1:37:47| as evidenced by no community input until an ill-conceived, admittedly disastrous meeting on February 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5867)|
| 1:37:56| Helen Ross McNabb personnel have been around long enough to remember what took place regarding neighborhood interaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5876)|
| 1:38:03| when they attempted to open their CenterPoint facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| Though it's been some time, I remember it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5888)|
| 1:38:12| The mayor seems to think that postponing this approval won't change anyone's mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5892)|
| 1:38:18| He's probably right, but that's not the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| The neighborhood deserves the right to have their concerns addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5901)|
| 1:38:25| and have the promises made by all of the agencies involved, both public and private,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5905)|
| 1:38:30| included in a memorandum of understanding that becomes part of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5910)|
| 1:38:37| Finally, there seems to be some idea floating around that there is or will be some form of contract administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5917)|
| 1:38:44| to monitor how Helen Ross McNabb performs against the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5924)|
| 1:38:49| I have searched the website, Knox County's website, and my memory of how Knox County works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5929)|
| 1:38:55| from having been in a management position with the county for about 17 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5935)|
| 1:39:00| the most I could find is in the procurement regulations and the procurement code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5940)|
| 1:39:06| Both of these documents insinuate that the purchasing department depends on the using agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5946)|
| 1:39:12| to determine vendor performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| We would like to know who will be the designated using agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| and what methodology they will use to monitor contract performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| I would like to believe that my sense of stepping through the looking glass regarding this undertaking is temporary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5966)|
| 1:39:33| and that the commission will get themselves off the point of the spear again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| by postponing approval of this contract until these issues can be resolved to everyone's satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5978)|
| 1:39:46| To my email, I would like to add that as a citizen of the neighborhood affected by this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5986)|
| 1:39:53| I am insulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| I'm insulted that a group of supposedly trustworthy individuals would concoct such a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=5995)|
| 1:40:01| with little or no concern for input from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| No meetings with the community were included in the development plan and timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| submitted by Helen Ross McNabb in their response to the RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| and the first meeting with them was a mere month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6015)|
| 1:40:20| If, as commissioners, you are not insulted as well, let us be insulted for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6020)|
| 1:40:29| That you would be presented with a contract that's so totally incomplete and ambiguous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6029)|
| 1:40:35| suggests one of two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| There's something wrong with their thinking or there's something wrong with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6038)|
| 1:40:43| Perhaps it's a little of each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| Specifically, the contract itself calls for the, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| agency's revised and finalized documentation regarding the services to be provided by it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6050)|
| 1:40:57| and the cost of those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| The required documentation is conspicuous in its absence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6060)|
| 1:41:05| and there is no item in the development plan and timeline that specifies when it will be produced, if ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6065)|
| 1:41:12| Much has been made of the detail in the RFP response as a guide to understanding the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6072)|
| 1:41:18| Unfortunately, the response contained items not included in the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6078)|
| 1:41:24| and multiple options for other services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| It is inconceivable that this document could even be considered a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6088)|
| 1:41:33| and that this body would consider approving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| You have my sympathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| It should have never gotten this far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| Truly, if this is approved without serious modification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| I am convinced that we have stepped through the looking glass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| and I caution other neighborhoods in the county to be wary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| You could be joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6117)|
| 1:41:58| Linda J. Meyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6118)|
| 1:42:08| I remind you of the five minutes, and please try to bring us new stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6128)|
| 1:42:14| It's Lida J. Meyer, 4721 Clark Drive, Knoxville, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6134)|
| 1:42:22| I am glad to see this finally coming to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| It's been a long time coming, and, you know, I can sympathize with the not-in-my-backyard feelings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6145)|
| 1:42:34| but, you know, statistically, studies have been really clear that you're much safer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6154)|
| 1:42:40| from someone with mental illness than you are with the average person in your neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6160)|
| 1:42:47| much less likely to have problems of any kind of violence or any kind of real problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| And that argument has been seen before with Menbilla Manor and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6172)|
| 1:42:59| Basically, I feel like you guys are going to do the moral thing, the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6179)|
| 1:43:05| You're going to vote to see this go forward, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6185)|
| 1:43:11| It's been a long time coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| It's been hard rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| There are people that really need services, and you don't get treated for mental illness in the jail here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6194)|
| 1:43:23| It's way too many people out there with mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6203)|
| 1:43:27| and this is going to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| It's going to help the community in the long haul, and it's going to be cost-effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| You need to pass this, and thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6214)|
| 1:43:45| John Mott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6225)|
| 1:43:50| My name is John Mott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| I live at 4721 Clark Drive, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| I am very much for the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| The main opposition seems to come from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6242)|
| 1:44:07| Every neighborhood has those feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| I'd like to point out that the center of the population in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6249)|
| 1:44:15| it's a little bit northwest of the intersection of 640 and Western.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6255)|
| 1:44:22| That puts it right about at center point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| What better place to have a safety center than in the middle of the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6265)|
| 1:44:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| Virginia Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6273)|
| 1:44:54| My name is Virginia Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| I live at 918 Grant Street, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6297)|
| 1:45:03| I wish to speak in favor of the city establishing the treatment center under discussion in the suggested location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6303)|
| 1:45:13| Neighbors are against this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| I would think that it's been talked to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6317)|
| 1:45:22| It's been talked for years about having a center where it should be, this place and that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6322)|
| 1:45:29| Now, these people in this neighborhood are saying, put it in another neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6329)|
| 1:45:34| I live in another neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| We have I don't know how many number of family and children's service apartments right in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6337)|
| 1:45:47| I live a block and a half away from a halfway house for paroled prisoners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6347)|
| 1:45:54| And these neighbors are worried about mentally ill people that will be put there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6354)|
| 1:46:01| and they will be under observation all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| They're not going to be wandering around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| They're not going to be able to be free like the paroled prisoners that can walk up and down my street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6367)|
| 1:46:14| So I would like very much to see the council go ahead with the plans to build this center where it's been suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6374)|
| 1:46:25| and not talk about it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6385)|
| 1:46:30| Joshua Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6390)|
| 1:46:44| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| My name is Joshua Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| I live at 5108 Fleetwood Circle, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| I live on the cul-de-sac at the top of DeWine Road about three-tenths of a mile from the proposed site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6410)|
| 1:46:57| My wife and I moved to East Tennessee in the summer of 2008 after serving as a United States Air Force officer for seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6417)|
| 1:47:04| and moving frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| I had been accepted to the University of Tennessee to their doctoral program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| and we were excited to move to Knoxville for a short time as I attended graduate school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6429)|
| 1:47:14| Our plan was to leave Knoxville immediately after I received my degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| and move to another city to live permanently and to adopt children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6438)|
| 1:47:23| However, as many of you in this room have experienced, Knoxville has a way of making you love it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| and over the years of my schooling, we decided to call this home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| When we first moved here, we were excited to start a new chapter in our lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| and we bought a modest home with a nice yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| It was closer to a main road than we would have liked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| but a pleasant barrier of trees separated our neighborhood from Western Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| and a community church at the bottom of the hill hosted neighborhood yard sales and holiday events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| But little did we know, however, that KUB would soon ruin our yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| that had attracted us to the house as they replaced sewage pipes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6473)|
| 1:47:56| Little did we know that years of construction of the widening of Western Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6476)|
| 1:48:00| would not only be an ever-present inconvenience, but would result in the woods being clear-cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| And little did we know that that church would move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| and the land would be used for a diversion center for jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| Our section of town has been through a lot in recent years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| and now this new facility is a great concern to my neighbors and me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| I've personally spoken to the other residents of our cul-de-sac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6499)|
| 1:48:22| and none of them believe that this is safe for our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| In our cul-de-sac, we have three retirees who have put in years of hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6505)|
| 1:48:29| and are now trying to relax in the safety they have earned from that hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| We have two high school girls who are launching their futures from this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| and my wife and I have a two-year-old daughter named Catherine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| who we want to be able to play in the yard free from fear of those who walk by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| Now, the debate about this facility seems to be about whether or not it should be allowed in a residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6524)|
| 1:48:49| but that phrase is a bit too sterile, it's a bit too clinical for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| because I don't think of this as a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| It is my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| It may not be a fancy one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| We have modest homes, we have modest incomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| Nevertheless, it is our neighborhood, and these are our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6543)|
| 1:49:08| There are 1,000 homes within a mile of this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| and the nearest one is a mere 60 feet from the current building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| As if these concerns of our community are based solely on the number of people who will be housed in this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6555)|
| 1:49:21| that is going to be so close to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| there's been lots of talk about the relatively small number of beds that will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| Even if that were our chief concern, the number keeps rising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6567)|
| 1:49:32| The nearby Helen Ross McNabb facility has increased its numbers of residents since it was first approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6572)|
| 1:49:37| and I am concerned about the possibility of an ever-expanding footprint in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6577)|
| 1:49:42| The property around the lot would be relatively cheap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| and it is not unimaginable that more buildings and beds would be added over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| People have suggested that our neighborhood needs to do its fair share,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| but I would suggest that we are doing so with the current Helen Ross McNabb facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| and we should not be asked to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| We are concerned about the overall safety of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| Where will individuals who were brought there by the police go when they are discharged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| We do not have a bus stop. Taxis are expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| And it's easy to sit here and say that they would not end up walking through my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6611)|
| 1:50:16| but I would ask you to consider how satisfied you would feel with such a dismissive answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6616)|
| 1:50:21| if this facility were going into your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| Would you assume that everything was perfectly safe for your own toddler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6624)|
| 1:50:28| with this facility three-tenths of a mile down the road, or would you have concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6628)|
| 1:50:33| The truth is you don't have to consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6633)|
| 1:50:36| You don't have to wonder whether or not that little baby girl that you finally got to bring home from China| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6636)|
| 1:50:41| gets to play safely in her backyard, but I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6641)|
| 1:50:46| I could suggest a thousand what-ifs, a thousand worst-case scenarios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| but I would simply ask you to consider the appropriateness of this facility being next to your house or your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6649)|
| 1:50:57| It is unfortunate to me that as dutiful citizens of Knoxville and involved community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| we have to hope that we say the right words and we raise the right issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| I would ask you that instead of making this an issue of rhetoric, you would simply consider what is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6667)|
| 1:51:13| Consider what would be right for your own neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| Consider what would be right for a more affluent neighborhood like Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6677)|
| 1:51:22| The same is right for all Knoxvillians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| We all deserve safety and security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| We all have dreams for what will happen in our homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| and I use that word home for both the physical house that we raise our families in and the city that we love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6691)|
| 1:51:38| Please do not taint these dreams by calling into question our safety and the safety of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6705)|

| 1:52:04| John Zimmerman, 5805 Briarview Lane, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6724)|
| 1:52:09| I spoke at the USUN review, the NPC hearing back on 3-7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6729)|
| 1:52:16| and just wanted to point to a few things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6736)|
| 1:52:24| We are here to represent the community that we represent, the Northwest community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6744)|
| 1:52:28| We are against the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| We have said that many times, and we've gone over that and made that very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6750)|
| 1:52:35| I wanted to go straight to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| The Knoxville, Knox County, NPC USUN review report for item 3L17UR dated March 2, 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6757)|
| 1:52:47| as stated in the comments section, made a comparison that the proposed facility is similar to the existing Centerpoint facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6767)|
| 1:52:56| and that the proposed facility would accept persons with nonviolent offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6776)|
| 1:53:02| This is in direct conflict with information contained in the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| Also, an NPC analysis of the Centerpoint facility dated March 13, 1997, by NPC 2-B-97-UR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6786)|
| 1:53:17| Mr. Dan Kelly made a distinction that the Centerpoint facility being proposed at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6797)|
| 1:53:23| would not be incarcerating or locking in the persons utilizing the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6803)|
| 1:53:29| The proposed facility is going to admit people who otherwise would be incarcerated, and they will be locked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6809)|
| 1:53:36| Therefore, the NPC analysis of March 2017 for the proposed facility is incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6816)|
| 1:53:43| The contract, addendum, and proposal by Helen Ross McNabb do not address public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6823)|
| 1:53:50| The contract, addendum, and proposal by Helen Ross McNabb do not address emergency procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6830)|
| 1:53:58| What happens if there's a fire and personnel must be evacuated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| How can a single sheriff's deputy deal with up to 39 individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6841)|
| 1:54:06| You can cite their proposal for those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| By him or herself safely evacuating them and protect the public simultaneously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6850)|
| 1:54:16| The fact is there has not been any thought put into how to operate the facility in a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6856)|
| 1:54:23| The statements were made by the DA and the sheriff at the February community meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6863)|
| 1:54:27| that persons admitted to the facility would be taken downtown and discharged by law enforcement personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6867)|
| 1:54:36| And I want to take that point off because we've been told that that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| can anyone confirm that that was changed in the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6879)|
| 1:54:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6883)|
| 1:54:44| That is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| There is a copy of the contract, and that is one of the two things that was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6885)|
| 1:54:50| That's why I brought that up. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| We'll go on to the next point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| Referrals to the facility are made by a judge or law enforcement personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6893)|
| 1:54:58| Judges and law enforcement personnel are not qualified to make a determination that a person is mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6898)|
| 1:55:04| Only a medical doctor with the proper training as a psychiatrist is qualified to make this determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6904)|
| 1:55:11| Due to these issues, a facility of this type should not be located in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6911)|
| 1:55:18| In person number four, the RFP addendum stated how much medical care can be expected on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6918)|
| 1:55:24| and how do we bill for this, or is this cost reimbursement as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| The answer by Knox County stated that it is expected that medical care will be minimal and can find a first aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6928)|
| 1:55:35| How can a facility that provides minimal care be classified as a hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6935)|
| 1:55:41| The state has only committed $1.5 million per year for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6941)|
| 1:55:45| What happens to the facility if it is not funded beyond the initial two-year period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6945)|
| 1:55:49| Helen Ross McNabb would be free to expand their existing facility or repurpose for other uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6949)|
| 1:55:55| such as halfway houses, methadone treatment clinics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6955)|
| 1:55:59| and others that are allowed under the recently approved use on review by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6959)|
| 1:56:05| The proposal states that the admission is voluntary, and this has been repeated by public officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6965)|
| 1:56:12| However, admission isn't voluntary because people are being admitted under the threat of incarceration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6972)|
| 1:56:19| They likely will have to make a decision on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| and how can persons under the influence of drugs and or alcohol make a rational decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6982)|
| 1:56:27| A better process would be to build a facility near the county jail with a holding area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6987)|
| 1:56:32| where a proper diagnosis by a qualified professional would agree to treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6992)|
| 1:56:39| by a qualified professional can be made regarding mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| Then, after a period of time, they would agree to treatment at an adjacent facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7003)|
| 1:56:47| inside the fenced area to ensure public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7007)|
| 1:56:51| I'd like to ask for two more minutes if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| Continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| A three-day detoxification period is also questionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7016)|
| 1:57:00| Private insurance usually allows a greater length of time for treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7020)|
| 1:57:04| The proposal states that the Helen Ross McNabb was awarded a three-year federal grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7024)|
| 1:57:09| for early diversion services in August 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7029)|
| 1:57:14| Because the three-year period has passed, what is the status of the funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7034)|
| 1:57:18| A follow-on and obvious question is, how will all of this be affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| with the potential federal budget cuts that are being currently discussed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7042)|
| 1:57:27| Knox County approved the existing CenterPoint facility in 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7047)|
| 1:57:32| The initial number of beds was 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| This has been expanded to 50 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| See the hospital certificate in the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| This was initially advertised as a 20-bed facility but has since expanded 150%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7061)|
| 1:57:48| Given this type of history, it is reasonable for the community to be skeptical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7068)|
| 1:57:53| of the projections offered by Helen Ross McNabb and the City of Knoxville, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7073)|
| 1:57:58| regarding the number of beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| It is obvious that the facilities will continue to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7080)|
| 1:58:03| The community has also had to deal with the closure of Ridgedale Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7083)|
| 1:58:08| The school has since been converted to an alternative school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7088)|
| 1:58:12| by the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7092)|
| 1:58:15| This community has absorbed more behavioral health facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7095)|
| 1:58:18| in proportion to other areas in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7098)|
| 1:58:26| We want you to consider the risk, the responsibility, and the liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| involved in the proposed jail diversion program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7110)|
| 1:58:33| and how it affects the families, the children, the voiceless, the least of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7113)|
| 1:58:38| the elderly, and every citizen who is a part of our great community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| We believe in helping others but not at the expense of the surrounding neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| or by putting undue risk on the citizens of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7127)|
| 1:58:52| We encourage you to do your due diligence in researching and reviewing the documents involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7132)|
| 1:58:57| which clearly show discrepancies and present substantially conflicting statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7137)|
| 1:59:03| So far, our representatives and local officials have approached this process carelessly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7143)|
| 1:59:10| and without regard for the concerns we've expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| We are asking each Knoxville or Knox County board, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| Knox County board to deny the location of the Helen Ross McNabb proposed facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7157)|
| 1:59:23| until the contract is amended or renegotiated to move the facility to a location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7163)|
| 1:59:30| that reduces the risk to the members of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| minimizes the impact on our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| and is in harmony with the general purpose of our citizens and our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7176)|
| 1:59:42| So, again, will you deny the contract until it is moved to a more suitable location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7182)|
| 1:59:51| Tyler Crabtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7191)|
| 2:00:03| Tyler Crabtree, 7801 Westland Drive, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7203)|
| 2:00:10| You spoke last week, being somebody who has been diagnosed with a mental illness with PTSD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7210)|
| 2:00:17| for spending some years within emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| I just want to reiterate that you are, by proposing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7221)|
| 2:00:25| you are laying down the foundation to a successful road of recovery for so many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7225)|
| 2:00:31| You are keeping mothers and fathers in the homes with their sons and daughters where they belong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7231)|
| 2:00:40| We are not bad people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| We are good people caught up in a bad situation trying to make things right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| There's no reason that anybody should feel alarmed or a heightened sense of security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7247)|
| 2:00:54| with having this facility next to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7254)|
| 2:01:02| By proposing this facility, you're also possibly breaking the generational curse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7262)|
| 2:01:07| and the chain of so many minor offenses being broken by fathers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7267)|
| 2:01:14| Their sons are going to follow in their footsteps and so on and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| So you're breaking that chain by allowing parents to stay in the homes with their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7277)|
| 2:01:23| I'm telling you, as a father of three little boys having been ripped away from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7283)|
| 2:01:28| and only here within the past couple weeks having unsupervised visitation with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7288)|
| 2:01:34| I can tell you, as a father, it is the worst pain that anybody can feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7294)|
| 2:01:39| If you are not willing to help these people get better and lay down that foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7299)|
| 2:01:46| for a successful road to recovery and bring them back with their family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7306)|
| 2:01:50| the cycle is going to continue and it's going to get worse and more people are going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7310)|
| 2:01:55| So I'm just asking you, please, as mothers and fathers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7315)|
| 2:02:00| recognize that you want your children with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7320)|
| 2:02:05| You want them to see you get better if you are in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7325)|
| 2:02:10| So please, just again, laying down, sending them somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7330)|
| 2:02:15| where they're not going to get the capability or the care that this center would be able to house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7335)|
| 2:02:24| it's unimaginable just being bounced from facility to facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7344)|
| 2:02:29| and having no one truly lay down a treatment plan for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7349)|
| 2:02:36| and that this is what this facility is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7356)|
| 2:02:38| They're going to get that treatment plan to where you can go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7358)|
| 2:02:42| and be successful and become a productive member of society again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7362)|
| 2:02:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7366)|
| 2:02:53| Carol Zimmerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| And while she is approaching Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7376)|
| 2:03:00| Where is Chris Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7380)|
| 2:03:03| Could you come to the commission office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7383)|
| 2:03:10| Carol Zimmerman, 3100 Fairview Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7390)|
| 2:03:16| I knew he knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7396)|
| 2:03:23| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7403)|
| 2:03:27| I don't understand why we're in opposition over this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7407)|
| 2:03:32| with it being in the communities the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7412)|
| 2:03:35| I grew up in a bipolar situation with my father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| My mother tried to commit suicide to get out of that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7419)|
| 2:03:44| We understand it's the location that is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7424)|
| 2:03:51| And you would see it as a problem if you lived where our citizens do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7431)|
| 2:03:57| on the same road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7437)|
| 2:03:59| So we want people to get help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| We are expressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| My grandchildren live in that community with my son John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7443)|
| 2:04:08| and they play at the Gym Tech right across from this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| They go to the daycare right around the corner, play, everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7453)|
| 2:04:17| go to neighbor's houses right around in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| And so we want a different location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7460)|
| 2:04:25| So we are in opposition to the location proposed by the Behavioral Health Urgent Care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7465)|
| 2:04:31| Jail Diversion Program, R173904 and R17-3-905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7471)|
| 2:04:40| In concert with other concerned communities, we have reviewed the proposed contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7480)|
| 2:04:46| even the addendums that were changed, to authorize the funding and the operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7486)|
| 2:04:51| Many of us have attended the community meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| and we have read numerous articles, public display of what went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7494)|
| 2:05:01| And as you are aware, the proposed facility is located in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7501)|
| 2:05:08| It is this fact alone, under all of the public discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7508)|
| 2:05:14| even what some of these folks have said, we're not opposed to HRM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7514)|
| 2:05:20| We're not opposed to helping people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7520)|
| 2:05:22| We are not opposed to our community rising up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7522)|
| 2:05:27| But rising up where it is, where it's located, that's what the heartbreak is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7527)|
| 2:05:32| And it can be put somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| They have a beautiful, HRM has a beautiful Middlebrook facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7534)|
| 2:05:37| They have other facilities, 18 properties, and I've looked at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7537)|
| 2:05:40| I've gone around and driven by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7540)|
| 2:05:42| There's other places that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7542)|
| 2:05:45| We are disappointed in our elected officials, city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7545)|
| 2:05:49| for how this process has been handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| You have not taken into account of how the community feels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| It hasn't even been worked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| This facility was bought in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| HRM, you knew what you were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7559)|
| 2:06:01| Y'all knew what you were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| Mayor knew what he was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7563)|
| 2:06:05| But they didn't talk to us until a month, eight weeks ago, six weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7565)|
| 2:06:11| We request that you vote to halt the approval of this facility in the northwest Knoxville area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7571)|
| 2:06:17| and find other locations suitable in a non-residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7577)|
| 2:06:25| In the city-county building, there's a sculpture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| It says, and I assume some of you might have paid money and helped put this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7588)|
| 2:06:33| Discovery, Enlightenment, and Truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| Perhaps as a society, we are discovering ways to improve the community and creation of a facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7595)|
| 2:06:42| That's discovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7602)|
| 2:06:43| Enlightenment is a virtue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| We're a society to helping our fellow man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7605)|
| 2:06:47| Again, this facility is a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| The enlightenment cuts two ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| our local government enlightened enough to oppose to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| and include the community in decision-making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7616)|
| 2:07:00| So, we feel we have been failed by our public officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7620)|
| 2:07:07| One thing that we've talked about, and I'll just mention them real quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7627)|
| 2:07:12| the community is, again, not opposed to the facility itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| We just want it in a non-residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| The 3720 Middlebrook Pike looks very nice for this type of facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7639)|
| 2:07:26| The attachment B of the RFP, it lists disorderly conduct, fighting, violent, threatening behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7646)|
| 2:07:33| hazardous or physical offensive condition as the public order charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7653)|
| 2:07:38| This is further clarified in the RFP under the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7658)|
| 2:07:43| Most will have a history of public order crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7663)|
| 2:07:47| Violent criminal conduct, this is in the RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7667)|
| 2:07:51| violent criminal conduct may disqualify admission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7671)|
| 2:07:55| In other words, the proposed facility will accept persons with violent behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7675)|
| 2:08:01| If it's a may, it's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7681)|
| 2:08:04| This statement is in direct conflict with the district attorney, the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7684)|
| 2:08:10| If you're interested in really doing the right thing, please read what we've sent you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7690)|
| 2:08:14| Please read what the citizens of Northwest Knoxville have sent you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7694)|
| 2:08:18| The MPC approved the zoning request based on the facility being classified as a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7698)|
| 2:08:24| The RFP under question number seven questions how the facility was to be classified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7704)|
| 2:08:30| And the county's response, in quotes, the laws of the state of Tennessee apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7710)|
| 2:08:36| The fact is that this facility is going to admit people who otherwise would be incarcerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7716)|
| 2:08:42| So they would be imprisoned. They'd be confined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7722)|
| 2:08:45| But now they're going to be confined in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7725)|
| 2:08:48| This bore out the fact that the Knox County sheriff's deputy, they'll be stationed there 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7728)|
| 2:08:55| There's no definition in the city ordinance code for a facility that both jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7735)|
| 2:09:01| and provides behavioral health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| It's going to be expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7745)|
| 2:09:08| The process for approving the use on review zoning variance is flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7748)|
| 2:09:12| We're appealing the decision by MPC. We feel it's very flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7752)|
| 2:09:17| It's double talk, one saying one thing, one saying another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7757)|
| 2:09:20| Ms. Zimmerman, I am in possession of your letter and your time has expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7760)|
| 2:09:36| I know that we can enter into a discussion here at commission. I need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| Motion is properly before us. I see no discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7782)|
| 2:09:52| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| Thank you. Mr. Bagner, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7794)|
| 2:10:00| Jerry, I want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7800)|
| 2:10:02| You've answered questions over and over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7802)|
| 2:10:05| It's the same questions many, many times and you being highly professional and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7805)|
| 2:10:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7811)|
| 2:10:12| I do know that with you in charge that this center will be run with professionalism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7812)|
| 2:10:19| I keep hearing not in my backyard, not in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7819)|
| 2:10:23| Nobody, I doubt seriously that there's an area of Knox County that has more halfway houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7823)|
| 2:10:30| and behavioral centers than South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| I don't think you really have a whole lot to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7834)|
| 2:10:37| Let me tell you about Serenity Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| Serenity Network was on the same MPC agenda as the behavioral center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7840)|
| 2:10:47| I met with Mount Olive Baptist Church, Pastor Golden, and the senior deacon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7847)|
| 2:10:53| They did not say in my backyard as I've heard pastors say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7853)|
| 2:10:57| Their congregation didn't say not in my backyard as I've heard pastors and community leaders say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7857)|
| 2:11:04| They said we will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| This unit is a 16-bed center for women that are pregnant on opioids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7866)|
| 2:11:13| It's a 28-day program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7873)|
| 2:11:16| They did not say in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7876)|
| 2:11:19| This is within two and a half miles of my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| It's in with the neighbors there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| I had phone calls and questions about it when I told them what it was all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7885)|
| 2:11:30| There was nothing negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7890)|
| 2:11:31| It passed MPC on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| The reason it passed on consent was that thankful for my Mount Olive community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7894)|
| 2:11:40| and my South Knoxville neighbors, we care about people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| Not in my backyard like I've been hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| What a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7907)|
| 2:11:48| I've been talked to up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| I've been told that I'm not a good citizen, that I shouldn't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7910)|
| 2:11:55| I'll tell you what, I am a good citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7915)|
| 2:11:57| I'm going to be a good commissioner for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7917)|
| 2:12:01| I want to thank again Mount Olive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| I want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7923)|
| 2:12:04| You're a professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7924)|
| 2:12:05| The way that you were treated at the community meeting was a disgrace, a total disgrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7925)|
| 2:12:12| And I want to thank you for your professionalism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7932)|
| 2:12:16| And for a point of order, Mr. Chairman, the public's had their say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7936)|
| 2:12:22| And unless one of the commissioners come up and ask for their more times, I think that enough's been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7942)|
| 2:12:30| Public forum has ceased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7950)|
| 2:12:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7952)|
| 2:12:33| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7953)|
| 2:12:37| I've got in on some of the discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7957)|
| 2:12:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7959)|
| 2:12:40| I've got in on the discussions kind of late, but I have been studying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7960)|
| 2:12:45| And as I told or asked at the workshop, there were some things that I wanted to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7965)|
| 2:12:54| And it seems like when we get into the addressing of some issues, we get kind of excursive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7974)|
| 2:12:59| And I don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7979)|
| 2:13:00| So here's what I would like to have from you, Mr. Bagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7980)|
| 2:13:04| First of all, the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7984)|
| 2:13:06| I don't want a big, long synopsis, but why the need, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7986)|
| 2:13:10| The second thing is, why the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7990)|
| 2:13:13| How was the site selected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7993)|
| 2:13:16| And is it because it's close to other facilities, things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=7996)|
| 2:13:20| I don't want a rounding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8000)|
| 2:13:23| I want to know what the impact is, like for our jails and the community for these people not getting that kind of help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8003)|
| 2:13:31| And then the other thing, the look, the facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8011)|
| 2:13:34| How's it going to look in the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| Is it going to blend in or is it going to stand out or is it going to look like another business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8017)|
| 2:13:42| That's what I would like to see or hear from you, how that's going to look in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8022)|
| 2:13:48| And so I will end right there and hear your response to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8028)|
| 2:13:53| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8033)|
| 2:13:54| And thank you, Commissioner Daley, for your earlier remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8034)|
| 2:13:58| To respond to those four items, the need is rather overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8038)|
| 2:14:02| Our Knox County Jail, as you all are well aware, is the third largest facility in the state of Tennessee where folks with mental illness reside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8042)|
| 2:14:11| We need to do better by our community than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8051)|
| 2:14:14| People with mental illness are typically, as was referenced by one of the community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8054)|
| 2:14:22| typically less violent than the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8062)|
| 2:14:25| So that's just a wrong statement, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8065)|
| 2:14:30| The need in our community is to divert people from jail who don't need to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8070)|
| 2:14:34| That's the big idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8074)|
| 2:14:36| And we think, we've studied other models nationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8076)|
| 2:14:38| we think this is a solution that works for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8078)|
| 2:14:41| So I think that's very, very important for everybody to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8081)|
| 2:14:44| The site was selected because we own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8084)|
| 2:14:47| It was adjacent to another facility that does provide similar service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8087)|
| 2:14:52| We've been in that community for 19 years, and we've had really good relationships with our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8092)|
| 2:14:57| I think the sheriff referenced in the last workshop, they've done a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8097)|
| 2:15:02| There have been no calls by the police to our facility for any criminal activity, any unrest or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8102)|
| 2:15:10| So I think we've been good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8110)|
| 2:15:12| And the impact will be that people won't have to hit the jail, we won't have that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8112)|
| 2:15:19| People with mental illness will get treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| There has been concern that three days is not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8122)|
| 2:15:25| Higher levels of care in our community, like psychiatric hospitals, crisis stabilization units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8125)|
| 2:15:31| that are much more intensive than what we're offering is the standard of care in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8131)|
| 2:15:36| So you can do a great deal for somebody with mental illness in a three-day stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8136)|
| 2:15:40| So we think that's about right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8140)|
| 2:15:42| We think the RFP was thoughtful in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8142)|
| 2:15:45| Earlier RFPs, I think the county mayor had referenced in a prior meeting, there was a 23-hour length of stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8145)|
| 2:15:51| So this is triple that in order to make sure that there's enough time to provide the needed treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8151)|
| 2:15:56| The appearance of the facility will be a medical facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8156)|
| 2:15:59| It will look very attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| We did bring a rendering of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8161)|
| 2:16:03| Jason, if you could show the commission what that will look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8163)|
| 2:16:06| We will and have asked local neighbors for their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8166)|
| 2:16:10| I meet tomorrow with a neighbor who's on the back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8170)|
| 2:16:13| She's asked to have input on what the buffer will be between her property and our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8173)|
| 2:16:20| We're getting her input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8180)|
| 2:16:22| In the last workshop meeting, there was consideration that we might change the entry point to the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8182)|
| 2:16:28| We're open to that as long as city zoning permits that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8188)|
| 2:16:32| So I think we've tried to take feedback and incorporate that into the design of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8192)|
| 2:16:38| And we have an architectural firm who understands that charge and will indeed honor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8198)|
| 2:16:44| I think you'll see from this rendering, it's very attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8204)|
| 2:16:49| It will have all the landscaping that the city requires for a property in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8209)|
| 2:16:55| And, again, we think that will fit nicely on that Western Avenue corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8215)|
| 2:17:00| All of the frontage of Western is essentially commercial or retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8220)|
| 2:17:05| Everything off the street ends up being residential behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8225)|
| 2:17:09| I hope that answers your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| Commissioner Bussel, your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8231)|
| 2:17:13| Do you wish to ask any additional information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8233)|
| 2:17:16| Well, the last little statement you said, the back part is residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8236)|
| 2:17:20| So you're going to have what back there to protect that residential area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8240)|
| 2:17:24| We will provide a buffer, again, asking our neighbor to the rear what it is that she would prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8244)|
| 2:17:31| We've talked about fencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8251)|
| 2:17:32| We've talked about landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| We're going to get her input and take that into consideration, put up what she prefers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8254)|
| 2:17:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8259)|
| 2:17:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8260)|
| 2:17:41| Commissioner Andrews will be next, but let me interject something here before we continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8261)|
| 2:17:46| Listening to public forum, I've got some notes that need to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8266)|
| 2:17:51| make sure everyone knows that there are references to the RFP that are of issue not in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8271)|
| 2:18:03| Some have been addressed just as recently as this week because last week, last Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8283)|
| 2:18:08| I asked for all questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8288)|
| 2:18:11| I didn't want new questions showing up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8291)|
| 2:18:15| And the result of that is that people that are using this facility will be transported both ways by law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8295)|
| 2:18:28| No one will be put out on the sidewalk there at the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8308)|
| 2:18:33| All the incoming people will be coming under the escort of law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8313)|
| 2:18:37| and they will leave under the escort of law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8317)|
| 2:18:40| Also, something that has been added to the contract is that the state of Tennessee dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8320)|
| 2:18:46| will be expended before the Knox County dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8326)|
| 2:18:51| That's being sort of picky, but I use that to emphasize the fact that this is going to be a very picky contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8331)|
| 2:19:00| And the contract is for 16 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8340)|
| 2:19:05| It does not rely on the state authorized number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8345)|
| 2:19:10| It does not rely on what was requested in the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8350)|
| 2:19:13| There will be 16 beds at this facility in the contract by Knox County being performed by Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8353)|
| 2:19:23| I do that only to make sure that everyone knows that we're going to have all of the issues ironed out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8363)|
| 2:19:32| Zoning is at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8372)|
| 2:19:35| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8375)|
| 2:19:36| Yes, sir. Thank you, Jerry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8376)|
| 2:19:37| One suggestion for you, you need to get a better van out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| Better what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8379)|
| 2:19:40| A better van a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8380)|
| 2:19:41| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8381)|
| 2:19:42| I've got questions for Matt Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| Matt, if you don't mind to come up, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8384)|
| 2:20:01| Matt, I really want to ask a question in regards to the measurement of the contract of success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8401)|
| 2:20:06| or how are we going to continue to monitor, I guess, and measure this contract success rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8406)|
| 2:20:13| And what have you put in place to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8413)|
| 2:20:17| Commissioner Anders, being a new service and a new provider that we're going to be able to provide these individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8417)|
| 2:20:23| we'll certainly be leaning on Helen Ross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8423)|
| 2:20:26| But we want to look at what services are they referred to once they're diagnosed and we have a plan of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8426)|
| 2:20:33| Another thing that we'll be looking at is how many return visits are we seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8433)|
| 2:20:41| The other thing that we'll be looking at is what's the impact on the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8441)|
| 2:20:46| So we'll be looking at all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8446)|
| 2:20:47| And working through, we'd like to have more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8447)|
| 2:20:50| Not having done this before, we'll be leaning on Helen Ross| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8450)|
| 2:20:53| and we'll work together to come up with more deliverables for them in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8453)|
| 2:20:57| I don't know what the answer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8457)|
| 2:21:00| Leaning on the guy that holds the contract makes it a little bit difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| Maybe the state partnership or the local mental health, other agencies as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8464)|
| 2:21:12| It is plowing new ground, but we need to make sure that we're doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8472)|
| 2:21:17| I'm for the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| I'm for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8479)|
| 2:21:20| I'll be voting in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8480)|
| 2:21:22| I'm not exactly happy with the location, but I think overall it deserves a yes vote from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8482)|
| 2:21:30| I just want us to be careful moving forward that we're pulling the trigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8490)|
| 2:21:35| and holding them accountable and making sure we're getting results and not just spending money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8495)|
| 2:21:39| I've spoken with one of the assistant commissioners with the state of Tennessee for mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8499)|
| 2:21:45| and they're more than happy to work with us to make this project work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8505)|
| 2:21:50| Don't just lean on Helen Ross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| Helen Ross and that is an extremely professional and great organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8512)|
| 2:21:55| but don't lean on them just to check their contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| Right. I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8517)|
| 2:21:58| Commissioner Deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8518)|
| 2:21:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8519)|
| 2:22:01| I just want to acknowledge and recognize that we have heard the concerns of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8521)|
| 2:22:07| We understand your concerns about your family homes, your families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8527)|
| 2:22:12| and I want to make sure we acknowledge some of the concerns that the commission has brought up and addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8532)|
| 2:22:18| But we also recognize that there's a considerable need in the community to deal with mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8538)|
| 2:22:24| to deal with opioid addiction, and to make sure we provide, as we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8544)|
| 2:22:30| obviously a groundbreaking opportunity to look and see how we can serve the needs of all communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8550)|
| 2:22:37| So I just wanted to first say we acknowledge that, but we need to make a decision tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8557)|
| 2:22:42| And thank you, Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| I believe that would be Commissioner Thomas's line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8565)|
| 2:22:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8568)|
| 2:22:49| Jerry, can I ask you one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8569)|
| 2:22:55| You know, I think no matter what we do and wherever this goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8575)|
| 2:22:59| the community that is affected by it the most is with it being located nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8579)|
| 2:23:07| I would like to see them have input, whether it be quarterly, monthly, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8587)|
| 2:23:14| into a community group or something to where they are not just left in the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8594)|
| 2:23:20| They may see successes there and see something that actually is a great asset to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8600)|
| 2:23:26| And I hope there is some way we can put that together so that the community is involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8606)|
| 2:23:33| Commissioner, I appreciate the input on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8613)|
| 2:23:36| We have participated in other residential areas where we do this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8616)|
| 2:23:39| We have neighborhood associations we're part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8619)|
| 2:23:41| We do invite them into that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| It's something we'd certainly entertain with this neighborhood as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8623)|
| 2:23:46| and welcome that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8626)|
| 2:23:47| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8627)|
| 2:23:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8628)|
| 2:23:49| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8629)|
| 2:23:50| Mr. Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8630)|
| 2:23:53| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| Jerry, as you're well aware, I've worked in the social work field for the last 11 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8635)|
| 2:24:00| and I've actually had the pleasure on numerous occasions to work agency to agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8640)|
| 2:24:06| with members of your team on a different project specifically related to either the children's causes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8646)|
| 2:24:12| foster kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8652)|
| 2:24:13| And I want to be clear, as a fellow professional in that field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8653)|
| 2:24:17| hold you all in the highest esteem, and in every case, every service that I saw you all go into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8657)|
| 2:24:24| it's been done professionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| You've worked diligently to hire the right people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8666)|
| 2:24:30| And I know firsthand, and this gets a little bit to what Commissioner Anders had mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8670)|
| 2:24:37| is how we measure outcomes in this particular field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8677)|
| 2:24:42| especially as it relates to mental health, if you're talking about trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8682)|
| 2:24:46| or other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8686)|
| 2:24:48| When I was researching your work on this, the one thing that I personally latched onto was the Memphis model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8688)|
| 2:24:55| and it's my understanding that that's what you're going to be following as it relates to crisis intervention teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8695)|
| 2:25:01| The Memphis model, as I understand, is not just nationally but world-renowned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8701)|
| 2:25:06| as the benchmark for crisis intervention teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8706)|
| 2:25:11| It calls for specific training and a percentage of patrol officers to have SIT training each shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8711)|
| 2:25:19| also specific training as it relates to the dispatchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8719)|
| 2:25:24| If you don't mind, because it really hasn't been, if that's part of the model that this is going to be based on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8724)|
| 2:25:29| can you, for the benefit of my fellow commissioners and the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8729)|
| 2:25:33| explain a little bit about the Memphis model as well as the specific training on patrol officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8733)|
| 2:25:39| and dispatchers that you all have been providing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8739)|
| 2:25:41| And the Sheriff is welcome to comment on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8743)|
| 2:25:44| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8744)|
| 2:25:45| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8745)|
| 2:25:46| The CIT model, the Crisis Intervention Team model, was developed in Memphis, as you referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8746)|
| 2:25:51| It is recognized nationally as well as around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8751)|
| 2:25:54| They've done a tremendous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8754)|
| 2:25:56| The emphasis of the program is to train law enforcement in mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8756)|
| 2:26:01| and how to respond to people who have mental illness when they come on scene in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8761)|
| 2:26:06| Their job is, first and foremost, to recognize the symptoms, to de-escalate situations so they don't become worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8766)|
| 2:26:13| and then be able to intervene in the life of that individual while they're in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8773)|
| 2:26:17| So that's really the essence of the model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8777)|
| 2:26:21| What we have done here locally is, with the State of Tennessee's training through the Memphis model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8781)|
| 2:26:26| we have trainers on our own staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8786)|
| 2:26:29| They provide that training to local law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8789)|
| 2:26:32| Knox County Sheriff's Department willingly and gladly participates in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8792)|
| 2:26:36| They send a lot of officers through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| Knoxville Police Department does as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8798)|
| 2:26:40| We've actually trained University of Tennessee Hospital staff as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8800)|
| 2:26:44| and surrounding community law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8804)|
| 2:26:46| So, literally, there are about 300 officers that we have trained to detect mental illness in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8806)|
| 2:26:54| I think one of the references a while ago was they're not qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8814)|
| 2:27:02| I think the recommendation, thank you, was 25% of the officers on a workforce to be trained in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8822)|
| 2:27:08| in addition to specific ones on a shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8828)|
| 2:27:10| If you've done 300, that's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8830)|
| 2:27:12| That's a lot of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8832)|
| 2:27:13| And they take a great deal of pride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| I think what I would say about this is the officers take a great deal of pride in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8835)|
| 2:27:19| They go through 40 hours of intensive training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| They graduate from that training, or they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8841)|
| 2:27:24| But typically they graduate very, very well, and then they're prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8844)|
| 2:27:28| And then they're sought out by the shift folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| When somebody has an issue, they're sent to respond to that particular event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8851)|
| 2:27:36| And they do a tremendous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| And I think it's changing our response in the community from a law enforcement perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8858)|
| 2:27:42| That's the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8862)|
| 2:27:44| And that's why we have to have that as a foundation of what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8864)|
| 2:27:47| I hope that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8867)|
| 2:27:49| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8871)|
| 2:27:52| These questions are for Mr. Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8872)|
| 2:27:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8875)|
| 2:28:14| In the agreement, Knox County is going to pay the upfront remodeling costs of $1,200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8894)|
| 2:28:22| And during our work session, we were told that the behavioral health center was going to have 16 beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8902)|
| 2:28:29| and that Helen Ross McNabb wanted to transfer 15 additional beds down there for their CCU unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8909)|
| 2:28:36| if I'm using the right CSU unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8916)|
| 2:28:40| Is the $1.2 million going to renovate the entire building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8920)|
| 2:28:46| There is a total of $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| The city is $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8929)|
| 2:28:52| The state may give $400,000 or $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8932)|
| 2:28:55| I think that's where you get to the total cost of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8935)|
| 2:28:58| And so our $1.2 million is for the initial setup of that construction phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8938)|
| 2:29:08| which initially just is meant for the 16 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8948)|
| 2:29:13| So if they divided the building in half, we're just going to renovate the half that we're going to use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8953)|
| 2:29:19| I think the total cost, if we do that in half, it's a $2 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8959)|
| 2:29:24| So, yeah, basically we're covering our piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8964)|
| 2:29:27| And then the Sheriff's Department is going to assume 100% of the security costs for this facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8967)|
| 2:29:33| Is that your understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8973)|
| 2:29:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8974)|
| 2:29:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8975)|
| 2:29:36| And then it's my understanding that a use on review appeal has been filed to the Knoxville City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8976)|
| 2:29:47| which is the governing body over this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8987)|
| 2:29:51| If we move forward tonight, and since the City Council is the legislative authority for that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=8991)|
| 2:30:01| do we need to wait for that meeting to occur in a decision made by the legislative authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9001)|
| 2:30:09| No need to wait in talking with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9009)|
| 2:30:12| We can go ahead and approve as before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9012)|
| 2:30:16| If City Council does uphold the appeal, then everything would be dead anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9016)|
| 2:30:25| So go ahead with this contract, and then they will handle the appeal, I guess, tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9025)|
| 2:30:33| It's in April, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9033)|
| 2:30:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9034)|
| 2:30:37| It's in April. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9037)|
| 2:30:38| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9038)|
| 2:30:39| And then I just have one quick comment for Randy Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9039)|
| 2:30:50| Hey, Randy, we've known each other a long time, haven't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9050)|
| 2:30:53| Almost 40 years now, I think, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9053)|
| 2:30:57| And I consider you the expert on this because you've been working for eight years trying to get it to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9057)|
| 2:31:05| And I guess my biggest question is, with a population of 450,000 people that live in Knox County, is 16 beds enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9065)|
| 2:31:14| You and I have had this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9074)|
| 2:31:16| You've raised that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9076)|
| 2:31:17| A number of other people have raised it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9077)|
| 2:31:20| It sounds so low to most of us that's not in the business that it would not seem to be adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9080)|
| 2:31:27| But our plans, the projections are, is that we will see 3,000 to 4,000 people yearly through that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9087)|
| 2:31:34| Not everybody would stay the three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9094)|
| 2:31:36| Not every bed would be full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9096)|
| 2:31:39| way it's explained to me is that we think with this limited space now that it will be very adequate for our needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9099)|
| 2:31:48| our immediate needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9108)|
| 2:31:51| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9111)|
| 2:31:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9112)|
| 2:31:53| Commissioner Thomas, you have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| Yeah, just one follow-up, one quick thing with Jerry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9115)|
| 2:31:59| Because when I heard a few moments ago, I thought it was different from what we talked about last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9119)|
| 2:32:05| about the success of the program and how you measure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9125)|
| 2:32:09| From what I understand, I thought that once these people face being arrested or charged with something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9129)|
| 2:32:14| they've given up their privacy, they go into the facility, and they can be tracked in the system from that point forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9134)|
| 2:32:22| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9142)|
| 2:32:23| So the data that we talked about at the work session was will we know who uses the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9143)|
| 2:32:28| and will we know who repeats through the facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9148)|
| 2:32:31| And my answer to that was because law enforcement brings them to the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9151)|
| 2:32:36| we know through law enforcement's database who they are and how frequently they have been to that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9156)|
| 2:32:42| Their medical information per se is still protected as a provider, as all of us would want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9162)|
| 2:32:49| But we will know exactly who they are, and we will know how frequently they've visited this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9169)|
| 2:32:54| Right. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9174)|
| 2:32:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9175)|
| 2:32:56| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9176)|
| 2:32:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9178)|
| 2:33:00| Gary, I had a question I wanted to clear up on the occupancy of the building, and you and I have discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9180)|
| 2:33:07| And we're talking about 16 beds that the county is wanting for jail diversion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9187)|
| 2:33:13| and if you look through the RFP in your timeline at four months after approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9193)|
| 2:33:19| you talk about bringing the CSU beds down from the center point location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9199)|
| 2:33:26| You bring our capacity to 31 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9206)|
| 2:33:30| In the future, if we needed to expand this facility, how would you go about doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9210)|
| 2:33:37| and explain how the public side, which the CSU beds, as I understand it, are open to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9217)|
| 2:33:44| how that works in conjunction with the side that is, for lack of a better word, in custody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9224)|
| 2:33:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9232)|
| 2:33:53| So I appreciate, Commissioner, the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| So when you think about 16 mental health diversion beds, that's what this proposal, this contract is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9235)|
| 2:34:01| Part of our RFP response was to maximize other resources in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9241)|
| 2:34:07| The CSU, the Crisis Stabilization Unit, is already fully funded by other fund sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9247)|
| 2:34:12| We wanted to put it under one roof so people who go to this behavioral health urgent care center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9252)|
| 2:34:18| if they needed it, it would be readily available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9258)|
| 2:34:20| So we wanted to maximize and leverage resources that were already available to the community for people with mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9260)|
| 2:34:26| So that's how the 31 comes to be underneath the facility roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9266)|
| 2:34:32| Your second question, I think, was how does that work from a public perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9272)|
| 2:34:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9276)|
| 2:34:37| And what happens if we wish to expand the building that we're paying for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9277)|
| 2:34:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9281)|
| 2:34:42| So it would be incumbent on us to find another location for the CSU to move out of that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9282)|
| 2:34:50| if we needed more capacity for more jail diversion beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9290)|
| 2:34:54| That would be our responsibility as a provider to find an alternate location for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9294)|
| 2:34:59| Right now that facility is next door, as you know, Commissioner, and so those beds are right next door right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9299)|
| 2:35:06| So they're in that community, but we would have to find an alternate location to expand capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9306)|
| 2:35:11| I thought part of the logic for putting this building next door to your current facility was the location next to the CSU's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9311)|
| 2:35:19| Now are you saying you're going to move them outside of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9319)|
| 2:35:22| or will you come back and ask to expand your existing facility of Centerpoint to accommodate moving them back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9322)|
| 2:35:28| if we need that space in the jail diversion building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9328)|
| 2:35:31| The benefit is for the Centerpoint services to be in close proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9331)|
| 2:35:36| So not just the CSU, but the Centerpoint facility and the services they offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9336)|
| 2:35:40| So it's not as limited as you've articulated with the CSU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9340)|
| 2:35:45| And then so we would, in all likelihood, just move it back up on the hill to have that same proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9345)|
| 2:35:51| Okay, so you wouldn't be backfilling the beds that are vacated by the CSU?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9351)|
| 2:35:55| If we did do something with that facility in the interim, we would have to relocate those services to make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9355)|
| 2:36:02| Okay, you and I had spoke earlier about a possible amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9362)|
| 2:36:06| Are you not comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9366)|
| 2:36:08| Well, as I just articulated, the benefit of our proposal and the intent of the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9368)|
| 2:36:13| is to maximize those services for people at the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9373)|
| 2:36:17| And I think one of the things that I'm most proud of, the partnership of local government and state government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9377)|
| 2:36:23| is Knox County's $600,000 investment, if you will, for operational services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9383)|
| 2:36:29| draws down $400,000 from the city, it's going to draw down another million and a half from the state of Tennessee for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9389)|
| 2:36:36| So I just consider that a really wise investment to be able to match local dollars from our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9396)|
| 2:36:43| to get that kind of resource to people and citizens who are here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9403)|
| 2:36:47| So I like that, and I think it's a good strategy from where I sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9407)|
| 2:36:51| And we have, as you might imagine, as a nonprofit, we've got to find creative ways to get resources to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9411)|
| 2:36:57| I don't disagree with that at all, that the structure of this deal, as far as the funds, is really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9417)|
| 2:37:07| I've asked you before, and you've said that Helen Ross McNabb can't make a commitment to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9427)|
| 2:37:13| that there will be no further expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9433)|
| 2:37:16| I think a lot of people in the area are worried that there are, I believe, four other tracks within a quarter mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9436)|
| 2:37:23| that also have the 01 zoning, which is the zoning that this facility that we're talking about today is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9443)|
| 2:37:32| In your opinion, does there become a saturated point to where you put too many of these services in a community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9452)|
| 2:37:39| In my opinion, and Helen Ross McNabb's philosophy is we do scattered sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9459)|
| 2:37:44| I think it was referenced by one of the community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9464)|
| 2:37:46| We have 18 facilities in Knox County, none of which are right next door to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9466)|
| 2:37:51| Intentionally, we position those in the community so people can access them from where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9471)|
| 2:37:56| That's the best way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9476)|
| 2:37:58| If you think about education, and we were honoring earlier the superintendent, community school concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9478)|
| 2:38:04| having resources in the community where you live is the best model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9484)|
| 2:38:08| So we intentionally do that, and we have intentionally intended to do that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9488)|
| 2:38:13| So this is the first site that you've had two facilities next door to each other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9493)|
| 2:38:17| It's a good question. I'm not sure I've thought about it quite like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9497)|
| 2:38:20| We have apartments that are adjacent to each other, and so we have more than one facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9500)|
| 2:38:28| But we have limited capacity in any one community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9508)|
| 2:38:31| That would probably be the right way to answer that, Rainey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9511)|
| 2:38:33| Okay. Well, I want to make it perfectly clear, because especially to Mr. Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9513)|
| 2:38:39| the people in this community are not opposed to helping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9519)|
| 2:38:42| They're concerned with several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9522)|
| 2:38:47| I don't think they're so concerned with safety as they are the expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9527)|
| 2:38:50| and the rapid expansion that's taking place in these types of services in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9530)|
| 2:38:56| You know, I've said in the past that I truly believe we need to do something to help those with mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9536)|
| 2:39:02| and I agree with the sheriff that jail is not the right place for nonviolent offenders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9542)|
| 2:39:07| suffering from mental health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9547)|
| 2:39:10| And I do understand Helen and Ross McNabb's desire for the convenience of this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9550)|
| 2:39:16| but I have to ask myself, do we have to hurt some in order to help others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9556)|
| 2:39:22| And is the convenience of the provider more important than the harmony and concerns of the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9562)|
| 2:39:29| This location is an extremely residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9569)|
| 2:39:32| One of the speakers spoke about 1,000 homes being within a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9572)|
| 2:39:37| It is approximately 60 feet from a single-family house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9577)|
| 2:39:43| and there are several hundred people that have to use that residential road on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9583)|
| 2:39:48| to get to and from their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9588)|
| 2:39:52| And I've said all along that I think we could have possibly found a location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9592)|
| 2:39:57| in a more industrial or commercial setting where it wouldn't affect people who are taxpaying homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9597)|
| 2:40:04| I understand it would cost more to do so, but I also know how important it is that we get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9604)|
| 2:40:10| And I want to make sure everybody understands that I know we need to get this right, and this is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9610)|
| 2:40:16| and we need to help people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9616)|
| 2:40:18| Our society demands that we address this problem, but I just can't support the location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9618)|
| 2:40:25| and I wonder in the future are zoning ordinances, both the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9625)|
| 2:40:31| are something we're going to have to work on because they do not address a lot of these type facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9631)|
| 2:40:39| And I'm just sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9639)|
| 2:40:40| I'm in this position that I don't think I'm going to be able to support this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9640)|
| 2:40:48| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9648)|
| 2:40:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9652)|
| 2:40:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9653)|
| 2:40:54| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9654)|
| 2:40:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9655)|
| 2:40:57| 1, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9657)|
| 2:41:00| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9660)|
| 2:41:02| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9662)|
| 2:41:10| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9670)|
| 2:41:13| approving a lease agreement with Helen Ross McNabb Center, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9673)|
| 2:41:17| for the lease of property locate 3343 DeWine Road for the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center Resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9677)|
| 2:41:27| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9687)|
| 2:41:29| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| I do have a question about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9691)|
| 2:41:36| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9696)|
| 2:41:38| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9698)|
| 2:41:39| Yes, I do have one question about this, and I'll refer this to the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9699)|
| 2:41:44| In the lease agreement and the demise description and use of premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9704)|
| 2:41:51| the last line, all other uses of the property are prohibited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9711)|
| 2:41:55| how does that relate to anything outside of the jail diversion program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9715)|
| 2:41:59| and where does that stand in the order of operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9719)|
| 2:42:07| Well, you're talking two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9727)|
| 2:42:09| First of all, you have the defined services contract, which you just passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9729)|
| 2:42:13| This lease agreement is a separate document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9733)|
| 2:42:15| It does say, when it talks about the demised premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9735)|
| 2:42:21| and it says what it's for for the lessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9741)|
| 2:42:27| In this case, Helen Ross McNabb, Knox County, is the lessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9747)|
| 2:42:35| and it says the lessor, to develop and manage a behavioral health urgent care center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9755)|
| 2:42:41| to provide an alternative jail for qualified low-risk offenders who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9761)|
| 2:42:45| in the opinion of the arresting officer or the judge, have exhibited signs of mental illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9765)|
| 2:42:50| and or substance abuse and for whom treatment rather than incarceration will be beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9770)|
| 2:42:56| And then the wording you've pointed out is all other uses of the property are prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9776)|
| 2:43:04| I think that says what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9784)|
| 2:43:06| It can't be used for any other purpose than as set out as I just read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9786)|
| 2:43:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9795)|
| 2:43:18| Commissioner Daley, just for the record, I was in the news sent and quoted as a question on the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9798)|
| 2:43:25| I did talk to the law director and had that cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9805)|
| 2:43:29| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9809)|
| 2:43:30| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9810)|
| 2:43:31| Just real briefly, and Jerry, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9811)|
| 2:43:34| but when we talk about the CSU, there's not a whole lot of difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9814)|
| 2:43:39| And CSU is what we referred to 10 years ago as mobile crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9819)|
| 2:43:43| Most of those are from the ER through law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9823)|
| 2:43:46| I mean, it's a similar population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9826)|
| 2:43:48| So I don't think if we do mix those two, it's not a drastic difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9828)|
| 2:43:53| One is open to the public and one isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9833)|
| 2:43:56| I don't know if you can walk into the CSU or you have to be brought in by medical or EMS or police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9836)|
| 2:44:03| Frequently law enforcement brings them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9843)|
| 2:44:05| A family member in distress could bring them if they wanted to to the CSU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9845)|
| 2:44:09| Generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9849)|
| 2:44:10| But I agree with your statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9850)|
| 2:44:11| They're very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9851)|
| 2:44:12| Length of stay is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9852)|
| 2:44:14| You can almost take the name and put them on both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9854)|
| 2:44:20| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before us to approve the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9860)|
| 2:44:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9866)|
| 2:44:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9867)|
| 2:44:28| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9868)|
| 2:44:30| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9870)|
| 2:44:31| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9871)|
| 2:44:34| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9874)|
| 2:44:36| Madam Clerk, do we have discussion items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9876)|
| 2:44:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9883)|
| 2:44:44| We've got to re-consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9884)|
| 2:44:45| We've got to re-consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9885)|
| 2:44:51| That would clear the room up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9891)|
| 2:44:56| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9896)|
| 2:45:07| We have three discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9907)|
| 2:45:09| We're going to do those first and then we're going to take a brief recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9909)|
| 2:45:13| She's got to re-consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9913)|
| 2:45:14| Yes, she's got to re-consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9914)|
| 2:45:18| We will take a brief recess after these three discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9918)|
| 2:45:22| The first discussion item, the most important discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9922)|
| 2:45:28| I see heads ducking when I say June 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9928)|
| 2:45:35| June 19th at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9935)|
| 2:45:42| We will have a brief party time for our retiring employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9942)|
| 2:45:51| June 19th at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9951)|
| 2:45:55| Please assist Drew in ideas and monetary funds that we might have a party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=9955)|
