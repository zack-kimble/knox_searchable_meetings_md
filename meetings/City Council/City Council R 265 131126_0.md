| 0:01:43| Okay, is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=103)|
| 0:01:46| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=106)|
| 0:01:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=109)|
| 0:01:50| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=116)|
| 0:01:59| Items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| Mayor, you didn't look at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| You didn't look at me, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| I didn't need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=125)|
| 0:02:10| Council Lady Palmer, I'm going to recommend that we postpone Item 12A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| which has to do with the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| I also want to make sure that everyone did get a draft copy of the sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| that we've worked on for almost the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| Mr. Wallace was our able-bodied helper in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| And we do have a workshop coming up on December 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| It will also be open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| And the draft is online for people to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| So we would like to get any kind of written comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| And especially, Council, we hope that you'll take a look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| and realize that this is a foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| and a start for what we hope will be a future sign ordinance for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| So I'd like to make a motion to postpone 12A until probably the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=176)|
| 0:03:03| I look at Ms. Palmer over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| I have a hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| Only because you try to keep them on task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Get the job done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| The second meeting in January, because MPC will be hearing this on December 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| And then it will come to City Council, hopefully, the first meeting in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| So maybe the first meeting in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| You're saying first or second meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| Ms. Palmer says second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| We'll go with second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| Well, that gives time for, you know, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| For feedback, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Okay, so we have a motion to postpone 12I until the second meeting in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| What did I say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=221)|

| 0:03:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| The ayes have it, and that is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| Any other items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| Any items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| Consent items, which is one certificate of compliance and some pensions and 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=240)|
| 0:04:08| One pension I'd like to pull out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| Yes, all but Ms. Peters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| Can we go back to the last council meeting also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| Yes, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| We reluctantly approved a couple others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=261)|

| 0:04:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| The ayes have it, and reluctantly we will approve that pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| For the mayor's report, I just want to remind everybody that we will close our office on Thanksgiving Day and Friday afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=275)|
| 0:04:45| City offices are closed, so we wish everyone a very happy Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| And then the day after Thanksgiving actually begins our kickoff for our Christmas celebration, Christmas in the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=291)|
| 0:04:58| I want to invite everybody to join me on Friday at 6 p.m. in the Crouch Park Extension for the Regal Celebration of Lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=298)|
| 0:05:07| We will light up the big tree in the park there, and along the rooftop the trees downtown will be lit up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=307)|
| 0:05:15| and we're hoping to have a really festive holiday season downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| There are free family activities that will include pictures with Santa Claus, face painting, balloon art, train rides, and marshmallow roasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=320)|
| 0:05:28| Also, the ice skating rink on Market Square will open Friday afternoon for our very popular Holidays on Ice, which is sponsored by Home Federal Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=328)|
| 0:05:37| We certainly appreciate their sponsorship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| And then the rink will be open daily through January 5th except for Christmas Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| And something new this year at the skating rink is that they will have holiday-themed artwork donated by East Tennessee Children's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=345)|
| 0:05:55| This art is made by patients who are receiving treatment at the hospital, so make sure you take a look at that as you stroll along the square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=355)|
| 0:06:03| Also, in keeping with the holiday spirit, we have the Christmas Parade, which will be on Friday, December 6th at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=363)|
| 0:06:12| This is the WIVK and Advanced Office Systems Christmas Parade, so we appreciate also their sponsorship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=372)|
| 0:06:19| I know several council members will be there, and we enjoy everybody to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| For more information on any of our Christmas in the City events, you can go to the City of Knoxville website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=384)|
| 0:06:30| and we want to thank special event staff, particularly Judith Foltz and her two staff members, for putting all of this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=390)|
| 0:06:39| There are something I think I read recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| We have over 1,000 different events during the year, and I don't know a big portion of those around Christmas, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| There's so many things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| So we certainly appreciate them and our public service employees who really are out there stringing up the lights and the garlands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| and putting up the big tree and really making a lot of that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| They really worked for months to pull this off, so we encourage everybody to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| And finally, I want to invite everyone to a special announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| This is at 2 p.m. this coming Monday, December 2nd, in front of the Safety Building on Howard Baker Jr. Avenue over by the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=429)|
| 0:07:20| We can't give out the details yet, but it's something that involves the Police Department, Legacy Parks Foundation, and the Wood family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=440)|
| 0:07:28| and it's going to give us a really great community asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| So we encourage you all to come out and find out what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| Again, that's Monday, December 2nd at 2 p.m. at the Safety Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| And that's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| I would just like to expand on the workshop that we're having next Thursday, December 5th, beginning at 530 in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=464)|
| 0:07:53| It will be a workshop on the signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| but additionally we'll be discussing the ongoing discussion with the University of Tennessee and the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| turning some streets over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| Probably those remember that discussion a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| But we'll have a presentation by UT, and then soon to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| And then the sign ordinance will be after the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| Now I'd just like to say, Councilman Dellavopia, I spoke with him earlier this evening, and he is under the weather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| and didn't want to come spread that around here at the holiday season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| And we wish him a speedy recovery, and we'll miss him this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| Okay, any other Council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| Then we will get to elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| 8A is a resolution confirming the appointment of Craig Walker to the City Tree Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=525)|

| 0:11:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| Well, we need to back up just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| The e-mail that all of you, I hope, got this afternoon from Ms. Eislinger, who is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=686)|
| 0:11:34| what we're being presented tonight, and you've gotten a copy of it at your station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| is an amendment, a change, rather, from what we approved last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=699)|
| 0:11:46| And it's significant enough that we need to offer this as an amended version of what we passed last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=706)|
| 0:11:54| And then if that passes, I will ask that we do it on emergency so we can get it out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=714)|
| 0:12:02| Is that correct, Charles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| I get it right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| Yes, Councilman, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| Right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| And I'll withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| Then we'll thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| We need the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| Well, I'll let him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| Well, we need to go ahead and amend this to what you just received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=736)|
| 0:12:23| And for those of you who may not understand this half-inch document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| and maybe didn't fully read your memo this afternoon, I'm sure Ms. Eislinger can explain it to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=748)|
| 0:12:35| because there is some change in the actuarial tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| And I'm going to let Ms. Eislinger make whatever comments she would like about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| Ms. Eislinger, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| Yes, my name is Kathy Eislinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| I address the 7023 Shady Knoll Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| He's going to make a motion to make it with you back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=778)|
| 0:13:05| We are here tonight to consider the adoption of the amended and restated supplemental plan provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=785)|
| 0:13:13| As we discussed at the meeting on the 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| most of the changes here are to make changes that are required by the Internal Revenue Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| to keep the plan in compliance with their documentation requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| Also included in the supplemental plan provisions are the provisions of Division H| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| that the charter specifically stated should be included in the supplemental plan provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| The change that we have from the meeting on November 12th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=822)|
| 0:13:50| is that we have recommended some changes to the actuarial tables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| that are included in the Appendix A to the supplemental plan provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=836)|
| 0:14:03| Those came about as a result of an experience study that was performed by the actuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=843)|
| 0:14:10| After looking at the tables that have been in use for some lengthy period of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=850)|
| 0:14:17| and then comparing those mortality tables to the actual experience of the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| the actuary recommended some changes, particularly for Divisions A and Division G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=862)|
| 0:14:30| so that the tables the system was using to calculate actuarial equivalent benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=870)|
| 0:14:37| would more closely align with the actual mortality experienced by the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=877)|
| 0:14:44| So that's it in a nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| But there is some additional cost, which I think you probably caught in the little memo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=887)|
| 0:14:54| that may be incurred long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| This is not an immediate cost, but there will be some cost long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| So, now, Charles, walk me through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| What motion do I need to make first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| Your first motion is a motion to amend the ordinance to be the revised ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| That's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| And I seek a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| Okay, we got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| Now, before we vote on that, do I need to ask you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| No, we need to vote on this one first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| So, Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| Yeah, that's where my questions come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| You said earlier most of what's in here is changes that we have to make to keep the system legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=933)|
| 0:15:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| The changes that increase the projected liability are changes in the mortality tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Are those required to keep the system legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| The changes themselves are not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| The reason that we are here before City Council today is because the Internal Revenue Service requires that the mortality tables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=961)|
| 0:16:10| that the actuarial assumptions be specified in the plan document itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| And for the pension system, the plan document consists of the charter provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=976)|
| 0:16:22| and the supplemental plan provisions that are approved by City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| The charter reserves to the pension board the authority, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| to adopt new actuarial tables as it sees fit as determined necessary for the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| But because those tables have to be included in the plan document to meet IRS requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| then that is here today before City Council for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| But I guess my question is, if we just stayed with the old tables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| the plan wouldn't make the plan illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| It would not make the plan illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| And these changes in your memo, they say that they have an estimated long-term fiscal impact of, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| less than 1% of projected liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| And since our liability is around $500 million, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1030)|
| 0:17:18| $700 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| So it's potentially a $7 million increase of our projected liability through this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1039)|
| 0:17:27| And, no, it's not today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| And so, from my understanding, we're making a change here that's increasing our liability up to $7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1049)|
| 0:17:38| when we don't have to to keep the system legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| So I don't think I can support the motion to amend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| I think I would support just passing what we passed two meetings ago unanimously that would not increase the liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1068)|
| 0:17:59| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Well, Kathy, I'm going to ask you to try to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| because I thought as we discussed at the pension board that this was an integral part of keeping this plan legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1084)|
| 0:18:13| Maybe it's an aside, but I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| But we need to make sure we get this thing correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| Having appropriate assumptions as part of the administration of the plan is certainly important to keeping the plan legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1102)|
| 0:18:32| The requirement and the responsibility to adopt accurate and appropriate assumptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1112)|
| 0:18:42| is set forth in the charter, and that responsibility is delegated to the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| to consider those various things, the various mortality, the actual experience of the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| and to come up with those appropriate tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| The assumptions that were previously used by the system actually gave a little benefit to the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1139)|
| 0:19:09| that wasn't necessarily due because of the actual experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| The purpose of these assumptions is to determine if an individual decides to choose a particular option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1153)|
| 0:19:23| If they want a benefit that is different than the normal form that they would get under the standard terms of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1163)|
| 0:19:30| perhaps they wanted to choose to have a joint survivor annuity so that after they died,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1170)|
| 0:19:37| then a benefit would still continue to their spouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| These assumptions calculate what is the equivalent benefit in the form that they are choosing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1181)|
| 0:19:48| to what they would get under the terms of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| So we're not enhancing any benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| We're not adding any benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| What we are trying to do with these assumptions is properly calculate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| based on prior experience of mortality of City of Knoxville employees, what that equivalent benefit would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1203)|
| 0:20:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| Charles, you wanted to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| I simply wanted to point out that this is not an enhancement to the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| This is just reflecting math in reality as opposed to having an incorrect figure there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| that you're using to calculate these tables, the annuity tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| What you're really doing is putting the correct math there as opposed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| and it's based on mortality tables, which is based on how long people live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| That changes from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| They haven't changed it for decades, but now looking at the experience they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| they're putting the right math there so they can make the correct calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| But it's not an enhancement to the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| It's not something that it's already in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| You don't get to choose whether that's something that you're going to give to these employees or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| This is something that you're just having the math reflect appropriately what the reality is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| So I understand not wanting to have any change in how much your pension plan is worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1271)|
| 0:21:19| or what the liability of the pension plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| But you've already done that by making decisions about what goes into the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| What you're doing here is making sure that your figures are accurate when you project them for the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1287)|
| 0:21:34| who are making these choices based on what those figures are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| So they receive no additional benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| None at all from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| The plan was closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| So I don't know what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| That doesn't cross the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| We closed the plan, but that doesn't mean that we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| We've still got a lot of employees who are under that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| But that doesn't mean you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| You're saying we're not enhancing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| No, you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| You're just having the right figures associated with what that plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| If I might, this came about because we asked the actuary to do a study that we had not performed in, what, 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1328)|
| 0:22:15| 18 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| Ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| And so this is simply an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| So we're not enhancing the benefits at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| But because of the update, we are trying to recognize reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1343)|
| 0:22:30| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Councilman Wallace, did you have any more questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| Well, it's a lot of information to get in the afternoon to vote on it, I'll say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| But, you know, it's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| It can certainly be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| I don't think there's any real rush to get this done today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| If you wanted to postpone it and spend some time studying it, there would be no problem with that, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| from the pension board's perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| Yes, I wanted to ask Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| You mentioned this would be an additional expense to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| But I think I'm hearing, are we able to or do we know, are we assuming or guessing what that would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1389)|
| 0:23:17| I think we or maybe you can answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| Is it a ballpark figure or are we able to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| It's really hard to say for sure because a lot of it depends on the options that are chosen by the various retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1404)|
| 0:23:34| If everybody chooses the standard, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| just basic life annuity that is set forth under the terms of the division that they're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| then there's no impact because that is the benefit that has been promised to the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| The only change happens when you're trying to convert that benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| the benefit that's specified under the terms of the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| to another form so that they could have a survivor annuity, an additional payment to a spouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| or they could have a guaranteed benefit for 10 years or 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| or one of those options that are offered under the terms of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| I guess I would sort of differ a little bit on the use of the word enhancement because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1460)|
| 0:24:27| the memo I'm reading says the change in the mortality table used for Divisions A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| and G will slightly increase the monthly benefits for those Division A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| and G employees who retire on or after July 1, 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| and who choose a retirement option other than the straight life annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| That just means the real numbers are going to be a little higher than what we thought otherwise they would have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| using the old tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| It doesn't give them any additional money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| They're going to get that money anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| You're just going to have mispredicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| You're going to fail to predict it accurately if you don't use the real figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| It says it will slightly increase the monthly benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| So I guess I thought it doesn't increase the monthly benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| They're going to have that same monthly benefit if they make those choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1510)|
| 0:25:17| What it means is they will get more money than what you would predict based on these old figures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| that you were using in the old mortality tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| Well, I mean, when I read slightly increase the monthly benefits, I see that as a real, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1527)|
| 0:25:36| maybe it's just my reading comprehension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| but the change in mortality table will slightly increase the monthly benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| To me, that doesn't look like just looking at the value of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| and maybe I'm missing the point here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| and that probably goes back to what Council Member Wallace stated about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| we received this afternoon, and to try to understand it is somewhat difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| But if it was just reflecting the reality of our system, I wouldn't be opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| But from my reading of this paragraph, that it does affect benefits in a way that increases potential liability up to 1%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1566)|
| 0:26:15| $5 million to $7 million, I thought that wasn't important enough to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1575)|
| 0:26:21| But maybe I'm missing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| But reading that paragraph to me, I think that does sound like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| I don't know if enhancement is the right word, but it does sound like an increase in monthly benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1587)|
| 0:26:35| Well, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| Well, given where we are then, if Council would like a little more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| if we got one more meeting, perhaps the first meeting in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| if we pass this amended version tonight on first reading, then I won't ask for an emergency reading of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1606)|
| 0:26:53| We would simply do it on first reading and then take second reading next council meeting, if that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1613)|
| 0:27:00| That would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Keep us in the legal ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| We absolutely, you know, have to have something passed and ready to go to the IRS by the January 31st deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1623)|
| 0:27:13| But waiting another two weeks to give Council additional time to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| and ask questions about the impact would certainly be permissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1638)|
| 0:27:24| And I would certainly encourage my colleagues to, I'll give you Ms. Aslinger's number if you don't have it already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1644)|
| 0:27:30| and to talk to her in the interim so we have clarity on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| And if it is helpful, when the actuary was making the report to the pension board, he did provide some examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1654)|
| 0:27:43| And one of those would be if you have an individual in Division G that chooses instead of the standard life annuity of $1,000 a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1663)|
| 0:27:55| if they retired at age 60 and chose instead a 15-year certain in life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| their benefit under the current mortality tables would be $931.38 per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1681)|
| 0:28:09| Under the revised, that person would get $934.56 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1689)|
| 0:28:15| So, you know, we're not talking big numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| And depending on what option is chosen, you know, it may be more or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1698)|
| 0:28:26| But there's a slight difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| And if that person lives five years, then there would be an increased cost with the new tables, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1708)|
| 0:28:37| If we stuck with the old tables, we'd be paying $930 per month and the new tables $933.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1717)|
| 0:28:44| So there would be an increase in cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| It's a few dollars difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=1725)|

| 0:34:18| and this is uncontradicted, that the proposed use meets the D-1 design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2058)|
| 0:34:27| that apply to certain parts of downtown, that there is a need for transient parking in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2067)|
| 0:34:37| We submit as our exhibits here tonight the packet that MPC has submitted to you all prior to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2077)|
| 0:34:47| my letter of November 28, 2013, which I gave to your counsel, Mr. Frost, and he distributed to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2087)|
| 0:34:56| and also a packet dated November 26, 2013, which I also gave to Mr. Frost, and he distributed to you before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2096)|
| 0:35:09| I think it is at this time, as you can see, Royal Properties has submitted a design proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2109)|
| 0:35:20| compliant with the requirements of the D-1 overlay for downtown to use all of this lot for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2120)|
| 0:35:29| You're not really deciding whether or not the Prior Brown parking garage should be demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2129)|
| 0:35:36| That issue is pending before the Downtown Design Review Board and will be heard at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2136)|
| 0:35:44| You're only deciding if that petition is granted, can the applicant use the remainder of the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2144)|
| 0:35:55| and the rest of the existing surface parking for a lot and make it compliant with the D-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2155)|
| 0:36:02| Sir, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| The use of this property as a parking lot at this time is not the end use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2166)|
| 0:36:15| It is an interim use until a development proposal can be come up with and submitted to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2175)|
| 0:36:26| both the Downtown Design Review Board and the MPC for ultimate development of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2186)|
| 0:36:36| I realize I'm running out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| I would simply point out that the conditions imposed by the MPC are satisfactory to the appellant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2198)|
| 0:36:48| It will comply with them, and those are set forth in my letter and the MPC packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| And also, there is a need for parking in this area, as we will establish shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2214)|
| 0:37:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| Do I have any time left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| No, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| You're right on the money here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| Okay, next is Mr. Marvin House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| Please state your name and address, and I'll get the timer going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| Marvin House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| I'm with Merritt Construction at 10435 Dutchtown Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| Thank you for listening to us and being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| I've been in the construction business 40 years, 33 of them here in Knoxville, building a variety of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| Merritt has got a $150 million bonding capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| Everybody knows, hopefully everybody knows in the city council, our company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| We're doing the metal arch building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| We're doing Taylor Lofts, the old Arby building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| We're doing the Gay Street renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| Just finished several parking garage renovations at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| We do a variety of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| But what we're here about tonight is Prior Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| In an earlier presentation that I made, I started out by saying I don't take historic structures lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| I'm the president of the East Tennessee Historic Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| I'm a member of the Knox Heritage, East Tennessee Preservation Alliance, the Granger County Historic Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2287)|
| 0:38:14| I live in a 220-year-old grist mill that I renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| So historic structures are important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| The Prior Brown garage is beyond repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| I've been working on it for a little over a year, helping the owners try to decide what to do with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| And I know you're not here tonight to talk about that, but it's in deplorable condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| It's a reinforced concrete structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| Concrete can take compression, but it can't take tension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| Tension is taken up by reinforcing steel within the concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| Reinforcing steel, as Dwayne Grieve knows, a number eight bar is a one-inch diameter bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2325)|
| 0:38:51| There's reinforcing steel number eight bars of that garage that are the size of this pencil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| That has lost all its strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| You can't replace the reinforcing steel within concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| You can patch it, you can make it look pretty, but it is not a safe structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| So I recommended to the owners several times that we cannot repair this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| We engaged Bender Associates, a well-known structural engineer here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| who joined me in several visits and concurred with the result that you cannot repair this structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2355)|
| 0:39:22| So our recommendation is to do something as far as surface parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| We've made proposals to bringing it up to the standards of the cities with new lighting, new landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2368)|
| 0:39:36| So the condition of the structure just dictates that it cannot be used, again, as a parking structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2376)|
| 0:39:45| and a surface parking is the option that we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| Now J. Michael McGoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2392)|
| 0:39:59| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| J. Michael McGoy, 507 Southgate Street, Suite 900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| I'm the general manager for Republic Parking System here in the Knoxville area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| and I'm a certified administrator of public parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| I've been in the parking business about 12 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| and managed parking in many cities throughout the southeast, Nashville, Memphis, Chattanooga, Birmingham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| and different cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| I've been here locally managing the Prior Brown Garage for six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| and the condition of the garage has gone down quite a bit since we started managing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| to several different reasons, but the biggest thing is it's become a huge liability for our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2432)|
| 0:40:40| and for pedestrians and different people in and out of the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2440)|
| 0:40:47| So we developed a plan some years back to do some work to the garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| and we spent quite a bit of money and time doing fixes and things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| and we started consulting with structural engineers and that type of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| and they told us, well, it's going to take a lot more money than you're putting in right now to restore this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| and we got into a situation where we found out that even once we were to bring the building up to the current codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2466)|
| 0:41:16| with the registration, that we'd have problems with the use of the facility as a parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| So I talked with the owners of Recal Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| and we came up with the plan to maybe go a different route instead of fixing that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2486)|
| 0:41:33| So it's in pretty bad shape, and we have a hole in the roof that we haven't fixed currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2493)|
| 0:41:42| because we didn't know once we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| that we were going to have to take the whole roof off of the garage to make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| and once we do that, the engineers said, well, the walls of the garage could go either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| We don't know what's going to happen if you do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| and with the building condition it is, once they start removing layers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| it may be a lot more, and things will happen to that garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| So it brought us to the point we are now with the demolition project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| That's a little brief history on the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| Okay, now we will hear from those who are opposed to the appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| starting with Kim Trent, then David Dewhurst, and then Tim Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| Is Kim there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| Thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| Kim Trent, Executive Director of Knox Heritage, 11112 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| I am here tonight to urge you to deny the appeal of an NPC decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| and have you deny a use and review request for a property now occupied by the Prior Brown Garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2567)|
| 0:42:54| a building eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| that is both rare in the United States and a model for how modern parking garages are built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| when quality urban planning is a priority for a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| In addition, this appeal goes against the successful and accepted urban planning principles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| that have revived downtown Knoxville and communities across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| Knox Heritage supports the reuse of the Prior Brown Garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| and opposes the appeal of the NPC's decision for the following reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| based on the criteria that are used to review use and review applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| The proposed use is not compatible with the character of the adjacent neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| which is filled with significant National Register listed and eligible historic buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| such as the Bijou Theater, St. John's Episcopal Church, Cherokee Building, Cate Building, and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2613)|
| 0:43:39| Granting the use and review request will significantly injure the property values of adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| There are now highly desirable and valuable residential buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| that if this is approved will now face an asphalt expanse an entire city block in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| Three, it is simply bad urban planning to allow an entire city block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| on our primary commercial and retail street to be nothing more than asphalt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| and it will result in a net loss of parking spaces on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| once the multi-level structure is taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| This is being proposed on our award winning Great Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| recognized by the American Planning Association as a national model for revitalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| Granting the use and review is not good planning and will harm downtown revitalization in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| This massive parking lot already breaks the appealing pedestrian connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| to the historic Bijou Theater and the riverfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| and discourages residents and tourists from exploring beyond Market Square and the 500 block of Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| In addition, it disrupts the pedestrian connection that ties together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| all of the City of Knoxville's revitalization efforts on Gay Street from the riverfront to Emory Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2678)|
| 0:44:44| The applicant has been promising an office tower on the site since 1996| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| and says it will be 15 more years before that is financially viable if ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| That means an entire city block of Gay Street will be a surface parking lot for at least that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| In addition, the Prior Brown has historic value and is eligible for listing in the National Register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| Even though it was built in the 1920s, it's designed with street level retail as a model for garages being built today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| even though the current owners are responsible for its deterioration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| that has led to a hole in the roof and deterioration throughout the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| But it is ripe for redevelopment as valuable downtown parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| or as a premium mixed use retail residential space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| and we have already identified two interested buyers who want to preserve the building for reuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| if the buildings are willing to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| I hope you had time to review the rendering that I emailed to you earlier that shows the potential of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| This is an issue that will have a dramatic impact on the future of Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| as a successful and appealing retail, commercial and pedestrian oriented street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| We urge you to look at all the facts in the situation and deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| Downtown Knoxville and Gay Street in particular is at a critical point in its rebirth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| and a city block sized surface parking lot will harm the efforts that we've all made over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| that have made our downtown the dynamic and nationally recognized place it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| We request that you deny this appeal of MPC's very rational and well thought out decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| Thank you Ms. Trent. Mr. Dewhurst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2768)|
| 0:46:15| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| Good evening. My name is David Dewhurst, 123 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| I'm here tonight to urge you to deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2781)|
| 0:46:28| I have been a developer and contractor of historic buildings in downtown Knoxville for right at 20 years now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2788)|
| 0:46:35| and have certainly become aware over the years I believe of just what it takes to build a successful downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2795)|
| 0:46:42| and the impacts of parking on that downtown both from a surface parking lot standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| and from a garage parking lot standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| I have to say I'm a little confused by a couple of what I believe are contradictions of what I heard a little earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2810)|
| 0:46:56| On the one hand Mr. Seymour is here telling us that we're not here to talk about the demolition of the building at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| That's for a different matter, a different day and a different jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| And yet Mr. House is here to talk about the demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| Mr. House has told us that the building can't be fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| and yet his company has prepared and submitted and it's in your packet a cost estimate to do just that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| repair and fix the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| I can tell you I've restored a number of concrete buildings in our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| It is certainly possible to restore these types of structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| I don't specifically know, I have not analyzed this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| and nor am I here to comment tonight about the demolition in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| nor about the costs involved of restoring a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| But these things are technically feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| I am here tonight to tell you that about what I think is a significant adverse impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2862)|
| 0:47:49| that turning this parcel into another surface parking lot in downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2869)|
| 0:47:58| the impact that it has negatively upon adjoining properties and really the whole of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2878)|
| 0:48:05| I hope that you will take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| It is so critical in a downtown such as ours that we have a very fine balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2887)|
| 0:48:15| between the amount of surface parking exhibited in our downtown core| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| and to have a stable and successful and vibrant and continuing downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| We're at that peak already and I think going beyond the bounds of this factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2906)|
| 0:48:34| And adding another piece to this and going against the MPC's ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| I think it will be a very negative issue for downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| for the success of all of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| and for all the neighbors and the property owners that live alongside and adjacent to the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| Mr. Hill, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| Mayor, I'm not prepared to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| I have a good friend who I will not identify had signed me up at the last minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| and I just don't ad lib very well, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| And now, Mr. Seymour, you have up to two minutes for a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| It appears to me that the opponents focus on parking on Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2957)|
| 0:49:23| as a reason to deny this use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| There is already a parking lot on Gay Street on this block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| and it will continue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| We hear terms like technically feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| but those come from a person who has not inspected the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| The use on review and the evidence before you supports the need for parking at this spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2984)|
| 0:49:53| It supports the inability to utilize this building going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=2993)|
| 0:50:00| We need to bring this lot up to grade to comply with the new downtown design guidelines with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3000)|
| 0:50:09| as Mr. McGaughy mentioned, with lighting, with planting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3009)|
| 0:50:17| The plan actually proposes about one tree for every eight parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3017)|
| 0:50:25| So we need this to go forward for the continued improvement of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| When the market comes back at the right time, this will no longer be a parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| but at least for the foreseeable future it is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| Mr. Seymour, I actually had a couple quick questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| How long have your clients owned the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| They purchased it and the deed is part of the evidence in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3054)|
| 0:51:02| The deed from the United States government was May 15, 1995.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3062)|
| 0:51:10| So almost 18 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| The General Services Administration acquired all of the property on that block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3077)|
| 0:51:23| with the intent of constructing a new federal building on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| They demolished most of the structures on the block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| and then the Whittle Building became available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| and GSA dropped its plans and sold the property to our client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| My next question is didn't your client go before CBID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| the Central Business Improvement District, to request a grant to rehab the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| Yes, and it was turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| The fact that they went before the CBID to request a grant to rehab the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| wouldn't that directly contradict the evidence presented by you tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| that they cannot rehab the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| I don't know the basis of the CBID's decision-making process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| but apparently they did not feel it could be rehabbed either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| because they refused to provide the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| I was on the CBID board at that time, and that's not why it was denied by the CBID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| It was because the owners had this building for 18 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| and felt like the challenges of rehabbing the building, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3157)|
| 0:52:43| the dilapidated state it's in were due to neglect for 18 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| when they've had a tenant for most of that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| and didn't feel that a grant was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| But they did go before the CBID and request a grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| so presumably that completely contradicts any evidence they presented stating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| that the building is not able to be rehabbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| And before I get started on my comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| I'd like to ask Dr. Lyons to just go through where the city's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| while we've invested in structured parking versus service parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| for your involvement with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| Obviously, in the CBID, especially the core of the CBID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| structured parking, garage parking, is much preferable to surface parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| Obviously, you get more cars on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| Also, it allows for mixed use of a very valuable piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| Clearly, our policy has been and everything we've done has supported moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| from parking lots to structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| We've actually got two major projects doing just that right now that are in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| And that's clearly once the kind of structures we'd like to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| especially in the core of downtown, are mixed use if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| And definitely that is consistent with the direction that downtown has been going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3244)|
| 0:54:10| that we think is good, solid use of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| Clearly, our preference has been if there's going to be parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| that it's structured rather than surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| You know, I look at this issue and look about the surface parking issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| and I think, you know, why do people love downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| And I keep coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| It's not one building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| It's the collection of buildings close together that create special streets and spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3272)|
| 0:54:40| And the best example we have of that are Market Square and Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| And Market Square, there's no one building that really stands out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| but it's the collection of these old buildings that make Market Square sort of an outdoor space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3288)|
| 0:54:55| And the same is true for Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| And what's important about Gay Street compared to if you go to a lot of other downtowns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3297)|
| 0:55:04| that it is narrow, and that sort of wall of buildings really creates a room of Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| which makes it so special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| This building is not on Gay Street, but it's on the corner of Market and Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| where I both live and work, and it plays a very important role doing work there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| making that walkway from the federal building to Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| making that street, defining it and making it an important space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| And you'd be amazed how many people come down there to take pictures on Sunday afternoons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| because it is just something unique about it, and people love that scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| And what's important about it is that there's three-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| and four-story buildings on both sides of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3346)|
| 0:55:52| And it's on a corner, and it has retail on Church Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| And so we're trying to promote retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| This is a building that's built perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| It's got parking above and retail on the ground floor, and that provides a space there on Church Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3361)|
| 0:56:10| And when you're talking about service parking lot, a lot of this has been stated by the people that spoke before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3370)|
| 0:56:18| Service parking lots are just deadly for creating a vibrant street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| And corners are so important because they face two streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| And I say service parking lots are like missing teeth and a beautiful smile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| And if you have a service parking lot in the corners, it's like you're missing your front teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| I mean, you could still have a beautiful smile, but you just can't get past that gaping gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3399)|
| 0:56:49| Is that a dentist or a lawyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| He's a poet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| I've been to some rough bars and trying to pick up women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3417)|
| 0:57:04| Moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| Anyway, the point is, in all seriousness, this corner parcel is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3430)|
| 0:57:18| This building does do important work on church and market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| And having a service parking lot, as I said, it's not consistent with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| It's not in harmony with the surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| It's incompatible with the character of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| It would significantly affect the value of adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| For all these reasons, I'm not supporting the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| And hopefully no one will make a motion and we'll be able to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| Yes, I just have one question and then I may come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| How many square feet are in the building total, all floors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3474)|
| 0:58:15| Seventy-two thousand square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| Seventy-two thousand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| Yes, I wanted to ask Ms. Trent a question, if you don't mind coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3506)|
| 0:58:33| You stated that there were at least two parties that were interested in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3513)|
| 0:58:39| Are you at liberty to say what kind of things they would want there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3519)|
| 0:58:46| The folks that talked to me, one was talking about buying the entire site to do a new development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| That would be his interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| I can't testify to his abilities to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| but he's been involved in a similarly sized site downtown as of late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| so he's been in that arena before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| And the two others wanted to convert it to a mixed use with residential units in the upper floors and retail on street level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3541)|
| 0:59:10| I say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| Well, I had an occasion to go down and tour the garage and the building itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3551)|
| 0:59:17| I'm not a construction engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| It's in pretty bad shape, but I definitely would like to see it preserved, if it can be preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3559)|
| 0:59:28| A gentleman from Merritt Construction is saying that you don't think it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| Could I ask you, could you come back again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| I have one little question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| Are you saying you don't think it can be preserved for anything or just as a parking garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3578)|
| 0:59:45| As a contractor, we can do everything, anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| We can keep that building and it just isn't feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3588)|
| 0:59:53| I mean, you're talking millions and millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| Is that practical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| Thank you for answering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| Hey, Marv.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| You have an estimate in here for $1.8 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| do you assume that's to get the building back to make it a parking garage, the $1.8 million that we see here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| I believe if you look at that estimate, it has no concrete repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| because it's undetermined how bad that structure really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| We had some patching of evidence, areas we saw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| but we could not even begin to estimate how much to bring the structure back to a safe condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3627)|
| 1:00:34| And Richard Bender couldn't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| What was this estimate done for then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| It was done to do patching, cosmetic work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| and to begin the investigation as to what has to be done to save the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| Could the building be used while this is being done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| Could the building be used while this is being done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| The reason I ask is that all of a sudden if you take $1.8 million divided by 72,000 square feet, that's just $25 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3654)|
| 1:01:01| Could you build a building even like that for $25 a square foot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Is it worth $25 a square foot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| We don't know how bad it is, though, Dwayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| It may be $250 a square foot once it's repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| When the reinforcing steel gets that small, you understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| I also understand that when you go to places like Savannah and Charleston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| where there's just a front facade of a building or a shell of a building, it's like anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| It's like you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| You could fix that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| The question is, is it going to be $1.7 million or is it going to be $3 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| Or $50 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| We can tear the inside of that building down and keep the facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| We could do that, all four sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| It would be beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| And we'll make a new building inside, structural steel, get rid of all that bad concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| I'd be afraid to guess what that would cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| Do you think that part of the reason that the building is in the shape it is today is because it was not maintained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3708)|
| 1:01:57| I've only been involved with it less than a year, Dwayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| I don't know what the previous maintenance was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| I mean, there's been a hole in the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| I mean, it's obvious it's almost a demolition by neglect, you know, in terms of the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| I mean, that hole in the roof didn't just happen overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| I mean, it's been leaking for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| So I just wonder about that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| But I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| Once you get into the building and once you get into the price, it could be pretty costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| And you look at some of the major deterioration, it's on the lower levels, not the upper level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| which has the roof affecting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| So I'm not sure that the maintenance was really the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3753)|
| 1:02:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| I hear no motion to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| So if there is none, then the appeal fails due to lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| And we will move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| Thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3773)|

| 1:04:00| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3840)|
| 1:04:01| I have one question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| The first year is $154,000, but do we have any ideas about after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3844)|
| 1:04:12| What would the cost be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| Yes, Janet Wright, IT Director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| And I believe that cost is on the agenda information system here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| Pull your microphone down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| I believe that cost is on the agenda information system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| It's $86,160 a year, and that's for the total 400 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3868)|
| 1:04:35| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3876)|
| 1:04:37| Thank you, Ms. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| Let me just say that our company has done a similar deal like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| and it's amazing the funds that are saved just in gas alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| but the production of the employees seems to go up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| So, I mean, I think this is a real good investment and a wise expenditure of taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3896)|
| 1:05:02| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| We did have a cost savings estimate from several vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| and on the low end they're saying that we would save in fuel consumption about $1,000 per year per vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3908)|
| 1:05:16| Now, that might be high, that might be low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| but when you look at things like idling and speeding and rapid acceleration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| and then making our drivers respond to that and lower the fuel consumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| I think it's going to be a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| Don't know what the actual numbers will be, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| Thank you, Ms. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3937)|
| 1:05:38| Can we get it on our cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| Get it on all of your cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| Only city-owned vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| We don't want to know where Marshall goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| Although we might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| I walk most places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3953)|

| 1:06:32| to authorize the mayor to execute any and all documents to accept such grant award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=3996)|

| 1:06:53| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| I just saw Mr. Thompson there in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| and I didn't know if you wanted to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| and address what you thought might be some potential opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| or threats this next legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4025)|
| 1:07:11| We had that discussion earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4031)|
| 1:07:22| Good evening, members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| I think to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| it's going to be basically the same things that we've been seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| Annexation will be a hot topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| vesting of rights in terms of home builders and codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4054)|
| 1:07:41| hall income tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| powers that the local governments have that could be in jeopardy from a state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4065)|
| 1:07:55| We'll probably look at gun issues, eminent domain issues, codes issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4075)|
| 1:08:02| planning, just everything that impacts the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4082)|
| 1:08:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| I believe I mentioned this briefly some while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| Could we get some periodic updates on your activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| and your advice to our administration and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| Send it to the quarterly reports or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| so we have some idea of what you're engaged in and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| I provide a weekly report of all the bills that we are monitoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| I'm really more interested in just what Councilman Starr asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| the activities that will affect the cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| Well, this would be specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| This would specifically answer the question as to what exactly we're interested in working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4128)|
| 1:08:54| And I can coordinate that through the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4134)|
| 1:09:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| Vice Mayor Pavley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Yeah, I'd just like to say, you know, I've spent a lot of time in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| in the halls with Mr. Thompson, and he's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| I can say that he's a very hardworking individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| And I don't know how many years you've had this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| but I know quite a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| But he certainly represents us well and represents himself well in his firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4156)|
| 1:09:22| and is very respected in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| So I'm glad to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| And we look forward to working with you again this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| All the rest are consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| And nobody has signed up for public forum, so I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| Mayor, I just want to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| And, again, this goes back to the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| The concern that I have is that whether or not they're going to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| And I think it's imperative that we as a city watch whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| or not anything's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| I mean, from what I've read and from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| they have a track record that they haven't done anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| They also didn't honor their commitments of taking care of the rest of the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| And I don't know what would be necessary in order for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| or your administration to kind of monitor whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| or not they continue to let that building deteriorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| But I would hope that we would keep an eye on it so that it doesn't get in worse shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| than what it already is on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| There being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131126?start=4233)|
