| 0:06:37| I would like to recognize one of our planning commissioners who will be leaving us after this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=397)|

| 0:06:50| This is a proclamation on behalf of planning, Knoxville-Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| Knoxville-Knox County planning has a long history of thoughtful, considerate direction provided by its volunteer planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=415)|
| 0:07:04| which is continued by the service of Commissioner Elizabeth Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| And whereas Elizabeth Eason's career has been focused on efficiency, sustainable design, and healthy communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=429)|
| 0:07:18| which was also apparent in the eight years she dedicated to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=438)|
| 0:07:24| her goal as commissioner was set to see Knoxville-Knox County prosper through economical, equitable, and sustainable growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=444)|
| 0:07:34| And whereas her respect for the natural environment was perhaps most apparent in her strong advocacy to protect the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=454)|
| 0:07:43| and ridgetop areas throughout the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| Whereas Elizabeth's commitment to Knoxville is apparent in the incredible amount of time she gives back to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=467)|
| 0:07:54| She is a founding member of the East Tennessee U.S. Green Building Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| and a member of both the American Institute of Architects and Knox Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| She has also served on the Knoxville Tree Board, the Board of Environmental Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| the Knoxville Energy and Sustainability Task Force, and the Tennessee Energy Policy Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=489)|
| 0:08:16| And whereas Elizabeth's perspective as an architect with an eye for urban design has benefited the projects brought to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=496)|
| 0:08:25| and the conversations held amongst the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| Her insight, sound judgment, and poise will be greatly missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission and planning staff express their gratitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=514)|
| 0:08:41| for Elizabeth Easton's contributions to the community through good land use planning and dedicated public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=521)|
| 0:08:49| Beth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=529)|
| 0:09:08| And Beth, thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=548)|

| 0:11:02| It takes a long time to go through that, to redesign it, so we've asked for another 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=662)|

| 0:17:13| between its southeast terminus at West Hills Banyan Park and Bennington Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1033)|

| 0:17:27| to its intersection with Bennington Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| since it provides public access to the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| and leaves open the option for the park to develop in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| possibly including a more defined public entry at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1057)|

| 0:18:06| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| My name is Ken Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| I live at 8016 Bennington Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| I just want to remind everybody what this applicant says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| this application says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| Due to the corner lot codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| the dead end street does not allow proper use of my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| Pool and fence applications were submitted but were denied due to current codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| and street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| Due to this hardship, I'm asking for closure of the dead end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| So we have a private citizen who wants to be given public property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| for his own financial interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| And not just his own financial interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| his own commercial financial interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| My understanding is that he or his wife have a swimming pool business in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| their backyard with the swimming, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| swimming lesson business in their backyard with the quite large swimming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| pool that they have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| So the planning staff, your planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| noted that these were the reasons that were given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| that there was a financial interest to develop for him to have that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| And after there was pushback by many in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| then we got a lot of missives and communications that all of a sudden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1160)|
| 0:19:29| this is a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| Or this is a traffic issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| Or this is a local crime issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| Or a drug issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| But I guess I'll remind everyone that this is actually just a financial issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| someone who says he could not make full use of his land under the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| We believe that it's not correct, it's not proper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| it's not right to give a private citizen public land just for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| There was really no other reason that he gave in his application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| And that's the reason that I think that the commission has all the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| they need to make their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| Now I understand there's a lot of, been a lot of flurry of activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| a lot of interest and excitement over the possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| which was just floated as a possibility by your planning staff of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| maybe to develop the park, maybe have a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| I don't know how that will come out, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| I'm not sure that I'm in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| As I stand here right now, I don't think I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| But that's not what this commission needs to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| There's been no proposal for a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| There's been no proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| All the planning staff said, and I agree with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| is that the city should not tie its hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| It should keep its options open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| And the only reason that you're being asked to change things right now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| because the applicant wants to, for his own financial interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| his own commercial interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| So I think it's a pretty straightforward question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| and I'd like to reserve a minute in rebuttal if I still have a minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| Thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| Name and address, please, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| My name is Richard Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| I live at 7916 Bennington Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| and I'm the main applicant for the case number 5B21SC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| I've prepared a statement I'd like to read to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| The main reason we are discussing this case today, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| is to figure out how to solve a 65-year-old oddity of the dead-end street of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| Glenmore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| It is the only named dead-end street without an address attached to it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| all of residential Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| It was in the original plan for expansion of the West Hills neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| in the late 50s, but due to the gas pipeline installed in the 40s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| and the 10 Mile Creek watershed plan, no expansion was ever done to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| This resulted in the creation of West Hills Park years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| After 21 years of personally dealing with the issues of trespassing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| vandalism, illegal parking, picking up trash, and general upkeep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| with the most recent incident happening this past Saturday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| I installed a wood privacy fence where my old chain link fence was located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| A statement addressing the 21-year history has been submitted to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| All the past information should explain the reasons that's led up to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| current zoning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| With the recent addition, the planning staff's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| a second statement had to be submitted to rebut the current recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| Due to the planning staff's new suggestion to be against closing the dead-end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| street and have further development in the area, this has caused new objections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| against this recommendation from the neighborhood and from the West Hills Community Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| The association's statement against future expansion and for the right-of-way closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| has also been submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| Some of the neighbors on Bennington Drive had received misinformation about this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| and the term right-of-way and street closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| This caused a lot of confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| My wife and I took time to personally follow up with each neighbor in our two-block section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| of Bennington Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| After clarifying the misinformation, multiple new households signed off on approval for this closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1392)|
| 0:23:18| While others verbally agreed to the closure but did not feel comfortable signing the written statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| these new signatures have also been submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| All I ever wanted to do was put up a privacy fence to protect my family, my pets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| and my property from continuing traffic flow, illegal parking, trespassing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| and other issues like turnarounds into my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| With Phase 1 of the fence started in 2018, progress on these issues was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| Then after almost three years and the completion of the fence, a zoning issue arose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| That led to where we are now, trying to find the best solution to fix this zoning issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| and eliminate the main problem altogether of Glenmore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| Glenmore Drive and how to deal with this has been discussed for many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| with the current and past city council, county commissioners, HOA members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| and other city officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| This is why I have so much information about this dead-end street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| When each idea or objection has arose, it has likely been discussed for length over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1455)|
| 0:24:22| The only solution to the current zoning issue was suggested by my past county commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| Hugh Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| When referred to my city councilman, Andrew Roberto, and other city officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| we applied for the right-of-way closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| This process started with a simple variance with the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| but that would not solve the main problem of closing the street to nonessential vehicle traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| and removing the named street off the map and records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| My application was then referred to the planning office from zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| This brings us to our meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| In summary, after all the issues over the past 21 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| and the hardships that I've come to dealing with with this dead-end street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| I am asking the committee for the right-of-way closure to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| The right-of-way closure would allow me to fully access and utilize my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| while also relieving me of the current hardships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| and eliminate possible hardships of the West family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| Thank you for your time, and I'm glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| Thank you, Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| This was discussed at our agenda review meeting on Tuesday at some length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| Does the commission have any questions for staff or the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1530)|
| 0:25:38| I'm sure we'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| I had my light up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| At least I tried to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| Is it working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| I see lights flashing off and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| I did want the chance to ask the applicant a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| I also wanted to enter into the record the memorandum we received from staff this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| regarding the crime report for the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| Can that be entered into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| You have it before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| It was shared with the planning committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| It's part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| I did want to ask you a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| The first one is I understand I'm just trying to get the history down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| I understand you had a pool in 2015 above ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| and it was mentioned by codes that there was an issue with the setback and it was removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1591)|
| 0:26:39| And then I believe in a few years, some years later, you erected a pool again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1599)|
| 0:26:46| and then subsequently erected the wood fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| And so it would seem to me, and my question to you, is that since you had the pool in 2015| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1611)|
| 0:26:58| and codes came out to tell you that it didn't meet codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| why did you not check with codes for the pool and the fence, the fence height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1623)|
| 0:27:11| before you put it in, and did you think to get a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| Well, to answer that question, the 2015 pool that was in question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| it can be clearly seen on Google Street View maps from 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| It was a small, like 10-foot round dog pool for my daughter's 150-pound Newfoundland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1643)|
| 0:27:30| It was set up just for him to have something to play in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| It wasn't like a recreational pool, and there's videos of him playing in said pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| The zoning official that was driving by the street saw the pool, and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| hey, you need to have a fence up around your pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| I said, well, I'm not going to put a fence up around this $10 pool we bought off of Facebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| So the pool was removed and moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| And then he said, well, if you have a fence around the pool, that's what you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| So, yes, I did erect a fence later, and we bought a used above-ground pool that we did have installed last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1679)|
| 0:28:07| So I hope that answers the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| There was a question in 2015 about a small, as you call it, a kiddie pool or a dog pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1690)|
| 0:28:18| And the location of the fence, did you think to get a survey before you erected the fence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1698)|
| 0:28:26| Well, the fence was erected exactly along the old chain-link fence that was there when I purchased my home in 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1706)|
| 0:28:35| It was covered in vines and rusted, and over the years it had been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| So I put the fence exactly in the old plot line of the chain-link fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| And then across the back of the property where the gas pipeline runs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| the pipeline company sent a representative out to do a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| because that was the only gas, water line, or anything in the area to be put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1731)|
| 0:28:58| And that's where he marked where to put in the fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| and actually moved it 10 feet inside of my property line to make sure there's plenty of easement for the colonial pipeline that runs behind my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1740)|
| 0:29:09| Okay, so from what I hear, you knew that there was codes that would apply to the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1749)|
| 0:29:17| and you were a little confused about the property line for the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| My final question to you is, given the reasons that you have submitted to close the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1762)|
| 0:29:31| wouldn't a fence just move it back a few feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| That would handle your concerns, a privacy fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| And, in fact, you erected one because you felt it would handle your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| Yeah, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| The fence was put up basically for privacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| and also to keep people from driving through my backyard to enter the greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| which is done several times over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| The moving it back a few feet, I'm not sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| because the KGIS maps and where the zoning and the fence line falls, it moves with every picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1802)|
| 0:30:12| And I'm not sure why it's wider on my side of the street than the other side of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| because my fence is seven foot off the curb at the top and over nine feet off the curb at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| And putting it right on that same plot line of the old chain link fence, I thought it was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| And there was no height restriction to a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| The only height restriction came when the zoning official showed up and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| I can't have a fence more than 42 inches tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| But moving it back two feet still doesn't solve my issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| I do have an installed pool that I put in just for recreational use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| And my wife is a swim instructor in Alcoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| She does teach swim lessons at Prime Aquatics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| And the pool she picked was to be able to have her recreational swimming in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| to do flip turns and everything off the sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| So, I mean, that's – and due to the KUB clean-out that was installed years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| they put a giant clean-out right in the middle of my backyard when they redid the sewer line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| So there is no other place to actually place the pool that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| And that's what led us to the zoning and the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| And that's where it now refers to this meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| If that helps maybe get the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| Yes, and I appreciate your explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| But it would seem to me that given the location of the KUB clean-out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| that that is an admirable reason to go to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a variance to the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1894)|
| 0:31:41| I mean, that's a strong – I believe that would be a strong argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| And I'm grappling with why the city should give up an opportunity for future use of that right-of-way in any form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1905)|
| 0:31:53| simply because you erected a fence off your property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| Can I refer to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| That falls back to the 65-year history of this dead-end street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| It's why it's never been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| If the city was trying to develop it, the pipeline company had already been contacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| The city would actually grade over four feet above the pipeline to put a right-of-way street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| or any type of entrance into, say, a future parking lot or a future anything development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| Then the park in the neighborhood would lose greenway space if they try to put in a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| as far as to put in a parking lot or anything right there or any type of future expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| Plus, to extend past the dead-end street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| you'd have to cut down almost six to eight mature trees in that area to make any type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| And that's why over 65 years it's never been developed because of the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| Those pictures had been submitted as soon as the city planning said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| hey, we want to keep it open for future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| That all happened with a meeting on 5-21-21 that I was supposed to be able to attend to discuss these options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1976)|
| 0:33:03| but they decided to have it internal and uninvite me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| And then at 5-15 or 4-15 that evening on 5-21, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| We need to move on, and I think Director Brooks has a comment she would like to make before I turn it over to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| I just want to clarify that staff report comments were in no way intended to indicate that there were plans to develop the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| The Parks and Rec Department has no plans for development at this time, nor in the foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| So I just wanted to clarify that for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| I'm curious of why that was submitted in the case file to leave it open for future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2015)|
| 0:33:41| It was put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| It's keeping options open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| No one's saying that anybody's going to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| It's options in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| Yeah, I think this is a good lesson that if you're going to install a fence or build a pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| you probably should get a survey before you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| I don't see any reason the public should eliminate access points to parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2038)|
| 0:34:04| and so I will make a motion to deny the closure of Glenmore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| I'd like to second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| I'm sorry, Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| I second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| We have a motion by Commissioner Scott Smith, seconded by Commissioner Korbelick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| to approve staff's recommendation denying closure of Glenmore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| Thank you, Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| So it's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| It's been denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| It's been denied, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| I'll head upstairs to go ahead and file the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| Next is a sector and one-year plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2082)|

| 0:38:04| but it's the purple section that backs right up to Keck Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2284)|
| 0:38:11| And it's true what you said, that it is consistent with the development on Callahan Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| but you're not talking about the development on Keck Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| This industrial rezoning is bordering right on Keck Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| It is far away from Callahan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| It is on the backside of the United Parcel Service industrial shipping facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2310)|
| 0:38:38| What I want to talk about is 100 years of development on Keck Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| This is not consistent with the development that has happened on Keck Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| Keck Road is a very quiet, peaceful American community where people enjoy a nice, quiet existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2330)|
| 0:39:03| I have a petition here with 57 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| Over 95% of the people that are going to be directly affected by this rezoning have signed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2348)|
| 0:39:16| and they have lived there for a vast number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| They are, and there's going to be an argument about jobs and taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| These are taxpaying homeowners that do not want to see this rezoning where they're going to put an industrial facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2365)|
| 0:39:34| We're going from woods and grass and creek to an industrial facility right across the street from these houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2374)|
| 0:39:45| These people do not want to see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| They don't want any part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| There are other alternatives to an industrial facility there that could do a lot of things like provide jobs, provide taxes, just like this plan can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2391)|
| 0:40:05| This plan right here is going to disrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| It's like this, folks, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| It's just like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| This plan right here, what I find objectionable about this plan right here is go ahead and buy it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2412)|
| 0:40:20| and then we'll see what's in the package months later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| There is no one that can or will tell us what exactly is going to be in our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2423)|
| 0:40:33| And I'm sure that anyone in this room would not want that at their house, and we don't want it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2433)|
| 0:40:41| And so we didn't go out and try to get 200, 500 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| We got signatures of the people that are directly affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| This plan is not good for Callahan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| Now, I will grant you, I will grant anyone here that, one, the individuals that want to develop this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| they should have a right to do what they want to with their property, but not at the expense of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| I have lived there for almost 40 years, and it's quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| And now what we don't really want to see is trucks backing up, doors clanging, and noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2473)|
| 0:41:23| And that's exactly what you have at UPS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| And what I have come to understand is that there's going to be a comparable facility there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| but I haven't got any specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| There is no answers as to exactly what's going on, what's going to go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| I don't think that we should buy something and then later on find out what's in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| And I wouldn't expect you to do that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| So I say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| The people on Keck Road say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2514)|
| 0:42:02| And there are alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| I've brought some of these alternatives up at meetings with the people that want to develop this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| and I came upon deaf ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| An industrial facility backed up against Keck Road is not consistent with over 100 years of development on Keck Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2534)|
| 0:42:29| People have lived there and died there their whole lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2549)|
| 0:42:35| And now these people that are living there have signed this paper and have expressed their concerns, and I'll guarantee you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2555)|
| 0:42:45| not everyone on Keck Road feels this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| There are some people that are not opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| But the vast majority, over 95% of the homeowners there are against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| Now there's an argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| Mr. Moore, you're five minutes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| Can you wrap up real quickly, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| The last two things I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| There's an argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| Jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| They could bring jobs in there with a different type of facility that will not be corrupting noise and the people that live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2588)|
| 0:43:18| Number two, they could get taxes from these people here are paying taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2598)|
| 0:43:25| And three, it is not consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Thank you, Mr. Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2611)|
| 0:43:40| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| Alan Grissom, 8550 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2622)|
| 0:43:50| This is the first I've heard of any opposition to this level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| Back in April, we made a submittal and we were heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| We chose to, at that meeting, to postpone 30 days to meet with the adjoining property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2641)|
| 0:44:09| The request now, from my view on the map, really only affects four parcels, maybe five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2649)|
| 0:44:17| I would need to look at that because of where right-of-way is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| But we met in May with the adjoining property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| We heard some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| Questions were asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| We answered what we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| We then went back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| We provided a layout showing all of any potential because, at this time, there's not been any layouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| There's nothing done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| There's no conversations that I have with a development coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2678)|
| 0:44:44| We showed all parking setbacks, landscape setbacks, building setbacks that could potentially come if there were any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2684)|
| 0:44:53| That was to the second meeting that we then came to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| From, I guess, Barry coming now and speaking in those meetings, both of them, there were questions and comments asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2697)|
| 0:45:05| but there were not any alternatives that I heard because we have not presented anything that would be coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2705)|
| 0:45:14| As you know, with a development or to make your property marketable, you have to go through the zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2714)|
| 0:45:22| You don't put everything out there at once, not as in everything out there to be known because there is no I've not done any layouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2722)|
| 0:45:30| There's been nothing come or solidified with a user to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| The property, the desire is to rezone it to industrial, as you know, for certain uses to make it marketable for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2736)|
| 0:45:44| As you can see from the second meeting that we met with them, it was a very favorable meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| That's why I'm a little confused from the opposition at this stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| The meeting was very cordial, answered all the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| We left with no negative comments at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| And we removed a portion, as you can see on the screen or in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2758)|
| 0:46:05| We removed the portion all below Keck Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| So, as I said, majority of the rezoning is only hitting four parcels now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2769)|
| 0:46:16| I've not known heard anything of a opposition for these 57 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2776)|
| 0:46:23| That's new to me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| Never heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| And we took the effort with two meetings that seemed pretty favorable from our view and not heard any return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2785)|
| 0:46:34| There were calls this week to see if there's anything that we can discuss further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| We've not heard anything either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| And I'm open for any questions that you may have at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| Thank you, Mr. Grissom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| Chair will recognize Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| Chair will recognize Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| And to the gentleman who spoke in opposition, I just want to make sure I'm understanding it for him as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| This is only, we're only looking at the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| So anything that this applicant would want to put on this property would come back in a concept plan that we would have to approve later on, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2822)|
| 0:47:10| Would have to come to CODESAW.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| Potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| It depends on what they're going to, what they end up planning to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| Can we, if what we're doing here, is there a way that we can ensure that one of the stipulations, if we want to make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| that there's no connectivity to Keck Road from this for any industrial so that there's no heavy traffic on Keck Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2844)|
| 0:47:33| The city zoning ordinance does not allow for conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| Mrs. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| This may point that there has been an approved concept plan for the road to enter off of Callahan and nothing off of Keck Road at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2862)|
| 0:47:51| And that was discussed with the adjoining property owners that no connectivity would ever come from Keck Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| Thank you, Mr. President.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| I do have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| I just wanted to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| The property along Keck Road that I guess is in question is the property that is currently zoned agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2886)|
| 0:48:15| That's that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| The lower portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| Everything north, east, north of Keck Road, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| Is agriculture now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| There's a portion to the east-north, northeast, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| That is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| That portion is in the city or is it in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| Well, we're talking about two different things now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| There's a portion in between that is in the county that's already been through back in April that was approved for the rezoning to the Glide Industrial through the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2920)|
| 0:48:49| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| And that was in the April meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| I have a question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| Beth, could you get a little closer, please, to the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| What type of earths or landscaping do we have between the residential and those four properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2945)|
| 0:49:15| This is Liz Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| I'm a planner who assisted in reviewing this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2957)|
| 0:49:23| The city's landscape standards are found in Article 12 of the Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2963)|
| 0:49:30| and it establishes various landscape buffers that are required between non-residential, particularly industrial, and residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2970)|
| 0:49:41| There's quite a list of different planting standards and species diversity and other things that are required, as well as parking lot landscaping, which is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2981)|
| 0:49:57| This is Mike Reynolds, planning staff, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| Between a non-residential and a residential district, a landscape buffer yard would be required between any type of parking lot and a right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3002)|
| 0:50:11| There would be some landscaping standards regarding parking lot landscaping, perimeter landscaping there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| But between the industrial use or non-residential use and residential, there's a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3016)|
| 0:50:23| Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| A question to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| Is all of the proposed site opposite, across the street from Kent Road, is that all within the city, or is it still divided between the two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3028)|
| 0:50:40| This is Liz again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| If you look at the zoning map, we could have that projected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3042)|
| 0:50:49| I think you're having a little technical difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| Most of the proposed site is within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| The previous rezoning sector plan amendment that was mentioned, that went through earlier through the County Commission, was obviously in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3057)|
| 0:51:06| So, it's still within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| Well, the area that we're speaking about today is only in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| Or, sorry, only in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| The previous rezoning sector plan amendment that was mentioned, that went through earlier through the County Commission, was obviously in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3077)|
| 0:51:26| If you're looking at a zoning map, you can see...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| Excuse me, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| Can you speak up a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| Yes, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| Get a little closer to the mic and speak up a little louder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| So, you can see that there is agricultural zoning here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| The area immediately adjacent to Willowbanks Road and the interstate is within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| There is, however, a small portion of that area that's zoned commercial that is also in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3106)|
| 0:51:55| It's a mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| I mean, the city limits in this area are very back and forth and up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| Can you show us on the screen, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| Nick, could you pull down the screen just a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| I think one of the best maps to look at this issue is the standard base map that shows the city and the county colors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3128)|
| 0:52:26| Yes, and if we turn off the planning cases mapping viewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3146)|
| 0:52:35| So, it's not quite as stark as it looks on our screens usually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| but the yellow areas are within the city limits of Knoxville, and the white areas are within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3160)|
| 0:52:50| So, you can see there's quite a missing pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| Under the sector plan map, the red portion, I'm looking at the staff memo with the buildings on it, is actually in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3175)|
| 0:53:08| Sorry, with which buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| Up there, the red up there, that's county with the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| The red, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| No, so that's city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| This is the one-year plan map that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| This is actually a better reference to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| So, the one-year plan only applies to the city of Knoxville, not Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| So, everything that you're seeing there is within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| Okay, so all the colors in this particular exhibit are city, the white stuff is county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3220)|
| 0:53:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| Chair recognizes Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| Go ahead, Ms. Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| I wanted to ask Mr. Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| I do know the applicant had given some concessions and removed some of the property from industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3242)|
| 0:54:10| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| Was he aware?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| Are you aware of that, Mr. Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| I am aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| Wheelbanks owns quite a bit of that property right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| There is, on the back side where it says LDR right there, that was put on the back burner for various reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3263)|
| 0:54:34| There is a high-tension power line running through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| And so, they modified their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3278)|
| 0:54:44| What the initiative is, is to turn the checkered portion that's right across the street from our houses into a profitable business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3284)|
| 0:54:53| which is a fantastic idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| And I did mention at the meeting, the last meeting, that an office park would be advantageous to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3297)|
| 0:55:06| It would provide taxes, provide jobs, hire many more higher-paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3306)|
| 0:55:12| And I didn't mention it to you, but I did mention it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| And I made the same arguments at the last meeting online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| The problem I have with this whole thing, and most everybody has, is that we're buying today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3321)|
| 0:55:29| and we're not going to know exactly what kind of facility is going to be in there a year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3329)|
| 0:55:38| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| Let me ask you, staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| There was a comment that the applicant was going to give consideration to noise and lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| How will that be implemented once a plan is presented for development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3347)|
| 0:55:57| That will go through the plans review and inspection process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| And so, they will evaluate their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| And the proper implementation of that will occur through that department in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| I have a question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| Can you kind of talk to us a little bit about what protections that you guys have planned for those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3376)|
| 0:56:23| for the neighbors that live along in the Keck Road area in terms of noise, hours of operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| light, things like that, landscape buffering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| Well, as discussed previously and in the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| there is no intended use or layout of a building or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| even a user that's come to this developer to purchase the land at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3400)|
| 0:56:47| But at both meetings, the first and second, with all the adjoining property owners and all who showed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| we gave printed copies of the noise ordinance, the landscape buffers, the lighting standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3412)|
| 0:56:58| all those articles that Liz did describe there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| We gave them to them, and I detail that to them that we have to go by these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| And, you know, certain times of the day that work can be done or the noise, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3426)|
| 0:57:13| we do on past projects or any kind of development to give any kind of special considerations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3433)|
| 0:57:21| there can be noise studies done where if you apply it to a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| where that sound will travel and it will give you the distance that it goes and travels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| to prove what the decibels are in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| So we went through just presenting to them, as Ms. Brooks did describe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| that we would have to go and adhere to all of the regulations that the city has for noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3460)|
| 0:57:46| for lighting, and also for the landscaping buffers based on the Section B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3466)|
| 0:57:54| I guess the B buffers that Mike Reynolds did describe as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| Ms. Midas, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| I'm sure we'll recognize Commissioner Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| In looking at this being a plan amendment and a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3490)|
| 0:58:18| I'm of the opinion that staff has it right here that is this piece of property suitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3498)|
| 0:58:30| for what they're asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| They're not presenting a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| They're just saying is this piece of land usable or desirable for rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3517)|
| 0:58:48| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| They haven't presented a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| We'll see a plan when it comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| This is just the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3539)|
| 0:59:05| You can make suggestions that, well, maybe this would be good for an office park and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3545)|
| 0:59:12| My feeling has always been if you really feel that strong about it, you should be doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3552)|
| 0:59:20| He's doing what he thinks is right, and he's investing his money in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3560)|
| 0:59:29| I think that staff is right on this, and I would like to motion to approve staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3569)|
| 0:59:40| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| Before we go to vote, I will recognize Commissioner Scotsman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| Okay, and I just want to kind of make sure I understand what Dick is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| Now, this is in the city, so we won't get a plan back on this, will we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3590)|
| 0:59:57| We will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| It's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3600)|
| 1:00:01| I think this, once we rezone it, they have to adhere to guidelines, but it's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3601)|
| 1:00:08| Will we get a plan back at MPC or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| We don't know yet what they're proposing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| We don't know yet what they're proposing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| There are some uses that do require special use that would have to come back before the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3616)|
| 1:00:24| I just want to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| With the special district, what uses are approved for this mixed-use special district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3627)|
| 1:00:36| Sorry, the mixed-use special district is the proposed land use plan recommendation for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3636)|
| 1:00:45| So it doesn't necessarily allow any specific use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| It just recommends land uses that would be appropriate for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3651)|
| 1:00:58| It's the zoning that will determine whether or not a type of use is actually allowed in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3658)|
| 1:01:06| Does that come back to staff, or is it up to codes and construction codes people to enforce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| Many of the permitted uses in the use matrix on Table 9.1 under IG, if there is a P there, it is a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3672)|
| 1:01:22| So it would go straight to the City of Knoxville for permitting, at least for the portions within the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3682)|
| 1:01:29| And if there is an S by it, it means it would be a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| So there are primarily permitted uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3694)|
| 1:01:41| I mean, an example of one of the special uses in the city and industrial zone is a wind energy system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3701)|
| 1:01:51| A heliport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| You know, there are other uses that are permitted, like parking lots, lodges, meeting halls, industrial design locations, general industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3714)|
| 1:02:06| So those would go straight to city permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3726)|
| 1:02:14| Commissioner Dent, do you have any more comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| Everybody's light is off. Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| The motion by Commissioner Graf, was that for the plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| That's for the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| The sector plan, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| That's correct, Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| So we have a motion by Commissioner Graf, second by Commissioner Roth to approve the sector plans per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3754)|
| 1:02:41| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| Chair will entertain a motion on the one-year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| We have a motion by Commissioner Graf, seconded by Commissioner Roth to approve the one-year plan amendment per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| Opposed? Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| Chair will entertain a motion on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| I'll speak at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| Chair will entertain a motion on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| We have a motion by Commissioner Graf, seconded by Commissioner Roth to approve the rezoning per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3801)|
| 1:03:27| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| Opposed? Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| Thank you, Mr. Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| Mr. Grissom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| Next is a rezoning, agenda item number 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| Applicant is Jenkins Builders Incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| Location, eastern side of Old Tazewell Pike, western side of Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3827)|
| 1:03:53| Track size is 8.7 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| Present zoning is agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| Zoning requested, PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| Density proposed up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| Staff recommendation, approve PR zoning up to three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| because it is consistent with the growth policy plan, the sector plan, and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| Applicant, would you like to go first or would you like the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| I'll defer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3870)|
| 1:04:37| Name and address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| Thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| You have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| I'm here speaking in support of the staff recommendation, which has specifically for three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3887)|
| 1:04:54| The staff recommendation is consistent with the growth plan, and that's one of the issues I see the applicant raise in some correspondence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3894)|
| 1:05:04| Addressing the growth plan issue briefly, that was heard a lot about two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3904)|
| 1:05:11| as it went through a potential update process that was not adopted as required by state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| However, the mayor of Knox County has now just announced a complete look and planning effort on the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3917)|
| 1:05:26| and as part of that, Knox County Planning Alliance really expects the growth plan map and potentially rules to be revisited as part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3926)|
| 1:05:36| So that's the approach that we in the Planning Alliance really support for updating the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| We think that's the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| It has citizen involvement and such, and that's how we read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3943)|
| 1:05:49| So we ask you to support the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| Looking at this specific parcel, too, the rezonings that are for rezoning for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| I just want to point out that this is a small parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| It's in an area that's developed, but this is wooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| It's adjacent or buffers to an old church that used to be Corinth United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| I happen to know that because that's where my family started worshiping after the Civil War| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| when there was a split between Union sympathizers and non-Union sympathizers at Murphy Chapel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| But why am I bringing this up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| There was an effort in the county about 11 or 12 years ago to look at a transfer of development rights program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3983)|
| 1:06:29| and this would have been an interesting location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| We've had subdivisions built on Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| This would have been an interesting location to have taken development units from this parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=3994)|
| 1:06:42| and provided that to other subdivisions for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| So that would actually have compensated this owner in some respect for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| and allowed it to be undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| That's something we'd like to see more of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| We'd really encourage the Planning Commission to begin looking at transfer development rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4015)|
| 1:07:01| and conservation subdivisions because that can make development in the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4021)|
| 1:07:08| a little bit more attractive and amenable and preserve open space at the same time as allowing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| I'm here on behalf of the applicant Jenkins Builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| I wouldn't describe this parcel as small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| It's 8.7 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| It's 8.7 acres right on the boundary of the current urban growth boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| so finding that kind of acreage is getting more and more rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4061)|
| 1:07:46| Staff's recommendation is for three dwelling units an acre because it's consistent with the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| the sector plan, and the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| Our application for five dwelling units an acre is certainly consistent with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| and the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| It's just the issue of how enforceable at this point is the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| and, I mean, this property is relatively flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| It has access to Murphy Road, a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| It's consistent with the development and densities that are west of Murphy Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| and the sector plan is LDR, which allows density up to five dwelling units an acre in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| So it meets every criteria except this question of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| And during the process that Mayor Jacobs commissioned with the coordinating committee to look at the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4103)|
| 1:08:32| Commissioner Korbelick, you actually spoke at one of those meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| and called the growth policy plan old, outdated, and tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| And I would agree with that, and I would add to those descriptors that it is now obsolete and unenforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4119)|
| 1:08:45| And I've never really taken a deep dive into the actual resolutions that passed the growth policy plan before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| I wish I had because they're interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| I mean, just like this current process, the city and county approved the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| Farragut blocked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| They went through a mediated process, and they came up with an agreement that was adopted as part of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4140)|
| 1:09:06| And I included in my packet the actual resolution in January of 2001 where the growth policy plan was adopted in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4146)|
| 1:09:14| And in that resolution itself, it included an expiration date that the growth policy plan would expire on December 31, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4154)|
| 1:09:22| Now, the growth policy plan is a 20-year document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| We're now in its 21st year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| It contains in its provisions that it should be reviewed every three years, and that has never occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4167)|
| 1:09:34| This piece of property is unique in that just west of Murphy Road, we're in the urban growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4174)|
| 1:09:40| and to the east, we're still in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| And I have to think that had this growth policy plan been reviewed every three years like it should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4185)|
| 1:09:51| that there would at least be an extension of this area into the planned growth area, if not the urban growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4191)|
| 1:09:57| and that would accommodate the densities that we are asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4197)|
| 1:10:04| The sector plan is LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| And in the most recent recommendations, which, again, were adopted by both the county and the city in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4206)|
| 1:10:14| what they did was they wanted to remove the sections of the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| that dealt with extending densities above two dwelling units an acre into the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4219)|
| 1:10:27| Right now, you're limited to two dwelling units an acre unless certain conditions have been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| And staff agrees that the conditions to extend to three dwelling units an acre are met here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| but that's, again, under the growth policy plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| By removing that, what the city and the county both agree would be best policy is let's just let the sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4240)|
| 1:10:48| determine what the density should be because those sector plans are something that there's already a process in place to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| They're reviewed more regularly than the growth policy plan has ever been reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| And they do attract a lot of input from the community, from advocates like Mr. Murphy and the Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4259)|
| 1:11:08| And so it makes sense that if we let the sector plans control, there's more, there's a process already in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| and we can then have more predictability in what the densities may allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| And, you know, I actually agree with Mr. Murphy that we probably do, we certainly need to look at the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4280)|
| 1:11:27| and update it and reinstate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| We need to get more tools available that will address the concerns that Mr. Murphy raises at every meeting I've ever been with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| such as transfer of development rights and conservation developments, things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| because we have a huge sprawl problem right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| And one of the reasons we have a sprawl problem is because of this outdated growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| that we're limited in areas that can't accommodate greater density to two or three dwelling units an acre, if that applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4308)|
| 1:11:55| We're here, if we were limited to three dwelling units an acre here, we could build 26 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| and then the balance of the units, which would be 43 at five dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4319)|
| 1:12:04| we'd have to go somewhere else and try to find that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| and then we'd be extending that even further and further out in the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| and just continuing the problems that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| So until we can get the growth policy plan reinstated and revised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| which is the language that was used in the resolution approved by both the city and the county in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4336)|
| 1:12:23| then we need to look at the sector plans, because especially in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| the law department has submitted a memo back in 2017 with the past law director, Bud Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4346)|
| 1:12:33| and the current law director, David Boot, has agreed in an email where I asked him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| is this enforceable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| It's their opinion, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| And I share that opinion, and I would ask that under this circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| you approve the application for five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| A lot to unpack there, so let me back up for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| It's interesting that in 2001, Farragut is the one who actually voted against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| because three years ago they're the same ones that killed the current plan that the city and county both agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| which has led us to where Mayor Jacobs has now put together this commission to look at everything that we're going to be updating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4389)|
| 1:13:17| I'm also curious, what is the dwelling per unit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| Is it the one to three, is that correct, that was approved for Shannon Valley Farms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| which is basically adjoining this years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| Michelle is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| I'm not familiar with that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| That was before I worked here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| I was going to ask Mike, because he's been here longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| He's saying yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| And before anybody goes and says, you know, none of us was wanting this in their backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| I want to make it clear, I live right off of Murphy Road, so this is actually in my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| and I do believe that that area, because of the growth it's undertaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| what we're seeing going all the way out into Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| I do believe that when everything's updated it would be for more than three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4439)|
| 1:14:05| So before I make any motion about a happy medium here between five and three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| which if anybody can do the math it's going to be four, you know, that's where I'm leaning right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4450)|
| 1:14:17| But I want to let any other commissioners kind of have a say before I make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| It just seems I'm just grappling with this because the argument presented was that because the local government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4470)|
| 1:14:38| has failed to continually update the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| now we should ignore it because we never got around to doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| I have a little trouble with that logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| But I also feel that there is not a good reason to look at planned residential for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4490)|
| 1:15:00| as Mr. Mullins described it as being flat in planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| The intention is to allow innovative design due to environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| So I'm really bingling to see why the staff recommendation should not be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4511)|
| 1:15:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| This property is relatively flat, and I kind of agree with what the applicant said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| We have tremendous demand for housing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| Our area, we are being inundated with people from other parts of the country moving here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| We have a tremendous shortage of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| Prices are escalating at an unusual rate because of the shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| And, you know, we need housing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| And if we have a flat piece of property, it's not in the hillside protection zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4550)|
| 1:15:56| and we can do four units an acre instead of three and satisfy those extra families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| without having to put them in another farm down the road that we're going to take down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| I think it makes tremendous sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| So I agree with Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| I think this makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| I would support four as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| Chair recognizes Commissioner Hale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4577)|
| 1:16:26| I'd like to ask, thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| I'd like to ask Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| if for all those reasons that you explained, then why not five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4593)|
| 1:16:43| And, again, I'm looking at, again, Shennan Valley Farms at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| Across the street is at seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| The one we just approved right next to that is one to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| So it seems to be that four is kind of the common number when you look at that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| that everything is averaging out to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| and that's why I was looking at four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| When I look at all the surrounding developments in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| four seems to be a more natural median than three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4627)|
| 1:17:13| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| Would you like to make a motion, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| So, yes, I will make a recommendation, a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| that we approve it up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| We have a motion by Commissioner Eddie Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| seconded by Commissioner Graf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| to approve rezoning the planned residential up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| I hear two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| Commissioner Adams, Commissioner Corbett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| Motion carries two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4665)|
| 1:17:55| Next is a sector plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| Item number 14, the applicant is Carla Goines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| Location, south side of Ball Camp Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4685)|

| 1:19:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| I prefer not to have it postponed only because I've been working on –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4765)|
| 1:19:32| it's a food truck court and the property is actually 98 hundredths of an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4772)|
| 1:19:40| And I spoke with Mike Redman, who is the head of Blaylock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4780)|
| 1:19:49| who has the contract for the new Shad Road project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| and he came out the other day and where the driveway is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4793)|
| 1:20:00| me and my husband have owned this property for 28 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| and the state came through 18 years ago and bought us out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| bought 52 hundredths of an acre and our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4808)|
| 1:20:13| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| I am very nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| Take your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| You're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| The driveway – okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| I come to the zoning office back in the fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| and actually I come to the codes office back in the fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4826)|
| 1:20:33| and I had asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| is it okay if I put up a fence around my entire property and put gravel on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| and make a parking garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| And the gentleman I spoke with said no because your property is zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| residential, maybe agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| And so I said, okay, what about food trucks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| And he said you could put as many food trucks on there as you like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| so long as they're gone by night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| So I said, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| So I left that office and I went to the zoning office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| and I wanted to inquire about going ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| and getting it zoned commercial for my first idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| but the zoning office told me no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| that they would have to refer the zoning commission no because – just because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4876)|
| 1:21:28| So I left and I thought, well, okay, I've got permission from a city official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| that I can put up a food truck court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| So I began working on my property and scheduling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4898)|
| 1:21:47| calling and scheduling food trucks, and I got – I had some food trucks scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4907)|
| 1:21:53| They were there on April the 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| and most of the community seemed very excited about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4916)|
| 1:22:02| but there were some that didn't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| I feel like I'm going in circles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| So I opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| I had a grand opening on April the 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| and a codes officer came in and told me you can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| And so since then, I went and filed for the zoning application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4943)|
| 1:22:32| and that's why I'm here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| And I have invested a lot of my money into getting this project up and running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4955)|
| 1:22:43| and that's why I don't want to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4963)|
| 1:22:48| Thank you, Ms. Goins, and you did very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| Any other comments you'd like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4972)|
| 1:22:57| I think I do have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| Yeah, I'm not hearing any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| I don't see anybody standing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4982)|
| 1:23:08| I'm not signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| We don't have anybody signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| So at this point, I'll recognize Commissioner Jeff Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4991)|
| 1:23:18| You sent me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| Okay, I'll recognize Commissioner Root.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| Friendly commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| We're sitting next to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| Yeah, so I brought this up at agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| and I'm very familiar with that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| I developed a lot of trails down the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| and I really actually next to this soccer field and public parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5017)|
| 1:23:42| I think this could be a cool concept from a pedestrian standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5022)|
| 1:23:48| in a lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| But I was equally as concerned about the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| and limiting that access off of a brand-new highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| the county has been wanting to do for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| It really should have been where 640 was built 30, 40 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| during the World's Fair, and it never got done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| And so protecting that access, I think, is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| And the way Hitching Post is coming in with the new Hitching Post| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| and how all that works on that ball camp shot road, I think, needs some attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5056)|
| 1:24:23| And I think I heard our highway director say that he thought that that was a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5063)|
| 1:24:30| And so I'm not necessarily opposed to her use or what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5070)|
| 1:24:37| But I think I would like to hear Mr. Snowden say that he's got a viable plan worked out access-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5077)|
| 1:24:45| and then once that's done, I would feel better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| So I would make a motion to postpone both of these for 30 days to allow that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5087)|
| 1:24:56| My question is, is 30 days sufficient enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| That's that question to either Mr. Snowden or Mr. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| We think that 30 days should be sufficient for us to have a conversation with the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| and county and planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| We have a motion to postpone for 30 days by Commissioner Ooten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| What would the timeline be for the installation of shot road at that location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5120)|
| 1:25:24| I know they're pretty far behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| Not behind, but starting pretty far away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| They're grading right there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| Are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| So it's pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| I just had a couple comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5137)|
| 1:25:38| I'm kind of echoing what Chris says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| I live right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| I mean, it's right before the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| And again, I don't necessarily disagree with the access there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5144)|
| 1:25:50| I think we need to give engineering, I think engineering has some reservations about access off of Paul Camp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5150)|
| 1:25:57| and the access is preferable to go over to the other road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| And I'm not comfortable if that's worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| But also, I think we know we have a use on review coming up next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| and I would ask that we not postpone that use on review until August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| that we hear the zoning next month once the traffic gets worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| and then go ahead and hear the use on review as well in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5178)|
| 1:26:25| So it wouldn't necessarily create a hardship on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| I mean, if it's denied, it's denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| But if it was approved, I don't see the sense in making them wait another month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| to come back for a use on review and it be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| Before we vote, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| I have some questions, and these may be for what Mr. Roth has proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| And just understanding the sequence of events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| the applicant has already had some of the potential future uses taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5215)|
| 1:27:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| That's my understanding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| In April, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| April the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| And what Mr. Roth is suggesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| would the applicant be unable to continue to have any of those activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5234)|
| 1:27:21| until this is completely resolved in July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| Until the use on review is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| Well, it was going to go beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| We're in June now, and if it comes to commission in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| it's going to have to go before county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| So, you know, she can't begin to use the property for the intended purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| until it's passed county commission vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| So that would mean August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| Assuming everything is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| County commission meeting would be in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| In August, for the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| So just mapping this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| the applicant would be precluded from using the property in any way until August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5282)|
| 1:28:09| Best case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| Anybody from codes enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| I mean, Knox County Codes can correct me if I'm wrong, but it would be September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| It would be what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| It would be September before they could use the property if everything was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5301)|
| 1:28:27| Whether we approve today or deny today or postpone today is still going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5307)|
| 1:28:32| It's still going to be August or September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| Or September before they can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| Yeah, August best case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| Because of the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| If it went today, September best case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5321)|
| 1:28:42| So this postponement gives traffic time to see if they can work out with them or how they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5322)|
| 1:28:47| I understood the reason for the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| I was just trying to understand the implication that would ultimately have for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5329)|
| 1:28:56| Chair will recognize Commissioner Scottson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| Yeah, I'm just trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| I mean, I'd like to ask the applicant and then have a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| But where do you anticipate access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| Where do you have it now and where are you expecting it if this was approved today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5348)|
| 1:29:13| When we lived there, the driveway, it was right off of Ball Camp Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5353)|
| 1:29:21| And so now I brought in some gravel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5361)|
| 1:29:26| I kind of scooted the driveway down just a little bit so it would be directly across from Daybreak Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5366)|
| 1:29:33| Because in my mind, that made more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| People coming down Ball Camp from either direction would already be used to cars in front of them having to make a turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5376)|
| 1:29:45| So the driveway is very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| It's in almost the same location it was in when I had a house there and when I lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5390)|
| 1:29:56| But I scooted it down just a little because it made more sense to me to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5396)|
| 1:30:01| Yeah, I just was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| That's kind of going to line up with the new, there's a new intersection that's going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| And so I know that you would not be denied access because, you know, we wouldn't have that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5407)|
| 1:30:14| So have you talked to the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| Have you let them know or have they told you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| I have spoken with Billy Nelms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| Which I understand he's the road inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| And he said that the driveway would be right where it's at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5425)|
| 1:30:33| That would be the best place for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| And then Mr. Redman, he said he agreed that that would be the best place for the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5437)|
| 1:30:47| It is where it's at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5450)|
| 1:30:51| And I guess the other thing I was going to ask the county is that you're not sure you can make it work there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5451)|
| 1:30:58| Is that what you're trying to figure out or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| We have no concern with a single family home driveway at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5462)|
| 1:31:07| But we do have some reservations with the commercial use being at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| We would prefer it to be on, the access be on hitching post, if at all possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5472)|
| 1:31:19| would be our preference, just to minimize the conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5479)|
| 1:31:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| That's all I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| I just wanted to get that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| That's the reason that we may have to postpone is because those things have to be figured out, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5489)|
| 1:31:36| Would it make a difference if I had, like, a road going out to hitching post?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5496)|
| 1:31:48| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| I can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5511)|
| 1:31:52| Ms. Goins, that driveway is not closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| If we could work that out, we would allow you to use the old roadway to access what would be the new realigned hitching post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5516)|
| 1:32:05| So we could work that out with you potentially, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5525)|
| 1:32:12| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5532)|
| 1:32:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| I'm glad to hear Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| It sounds like he's saying there's confidence in being able to work out some solution for the way that the traffic flows with that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5536)|
| 1:32:25| I just wanted to say that when I originally heard and read the case, I was concerned about the commercial usage, but the CN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5545)|
| 1:32:37| in terms of what that could mean for that area, I feel like it's a very positive sort of shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5557)|
| 1:32:44| and particularly some of the innovative usage that the applicant is talking about seemed to be also very encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5564)|
| 1:32:54| So I was concerned about the delay because of the implication that could have for the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5574)|
| 1:33:00| food trucks being very popular in months when you can go outside easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| But if there's confidence from engineering that it can be remedied quickly and best case scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5585)|
| 1:33:11| then hopefully there's still some warm months, and I'm in favor of the rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5591)|
| 1:33:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5601)|
| 1:33:22| Because I know you're nervous and being up here, I just want to make sure you clearly understand what's happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5602)|
| 1:33:28| The motion that's been made is the postponement just of this one piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| This will not, based on what Commissioner Roth has said, we don't want to delay everything 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5612)|
| 1:33:38| So it's only step one would be to delay 30 days, but you've got to come back anyways for the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| We will hear both of those together at the next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| No matter what, even if we approve this today, did that next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| September is the earliest that everything could work its way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| We're working towards trying to keep you on that timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| We just want to give you and county engineering enough time to come back with a plan for where Chateau is going to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| to make sure that where the entrance would be would be safe for the people who would be coming to the food truck park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| safe for any employees and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| So we want to give them time with you to work out that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| So I just want to make sure you understand we're not delaying the whole project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| Just step one is going to take about a 30-day delay based on the motion before us, just so you understand where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| Because I know there's been a lot of lingo thrown around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| I just want to make sure you're not thinking we're delaying the whole project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| I understand that if it gets delayed today, it's going to hold me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| If it didn't get delayed, I would be possibly ready to set up food trucks in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5674)|
| 1:34:40| But if it does get delayed, it will be September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| Well, I believe what Director Brooks was saying, it would come before county commission in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5683)|
| 1:34:50| So by the time it got approved by then, you're really looking at about the first of September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| before everything would be signed, sealed, and delivered for you to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| That process will still be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| We do it in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| It will go to county commission in August, which will be September is when you could potentially start doing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5701)|
| 1:35:06| So we're trying to keep you on that same timeline as you're on right this minute by just this 30-day postponement of this one piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5706)|
| 1:35:12| but still hearing the use on review next month as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5716)|
| 1:35:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5717)|
| 1:35:18| We have a motion by Commissioner Uten, second by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| to postpone both the sector plan and rezoning for 30 days until the July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5720)|
| 1:35:28| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| Thank you, Ms. Goins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5735)|
| 1:35:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5736)|
| 1:35:41| Item 15 was removed from consent at the request of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5741)|
| 1:35:47| Chair will entertain a motion to postpone that item per the applicant's request for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5747)|
| 1:35:55| This is Lindsay Lieb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5755)|

| 1:36:11| Motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| We have a motion by Commissioner Roth, second by Commissioner Smith, to postpone item 15 for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5776)|
| 1:36:22| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| Any opposed, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| No opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| Just a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| Yeah, since somebody pulled that off, this was on consent, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| Yeah, the applicant pulled it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| The applicant pulled it off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5797)|
| 1:36:38| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5799)|
| 1:36:40| I can provide a little clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| The applicant had called me right before the meeting, and she was with somebody else in the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5802)|
| 1:36:50| and wasn't able to be here, but had wanted to pull it off to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5810)|
| 1:36:55| I'm assuming that was just in case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| It's not a typical protocol to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5817)|
| 1:37:03| Next is a plan amendment, sector plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| Item number 17, the applicant is Robin Askew, trustee for Option Older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5828)|
| 1:37:15| Location, east side of Marietta Church Road, northeast of intersection of Buttermilk Road, south of Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5835)|
| 1:37:24| Tract is 94.12 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| Present plan and designation zoning is AG Agriculture, Hillside Protection, and AE Agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5847)|
| 1:37:35| Post plan designation zoning is LDR Low Density Residential, HP Hillside Protection, and PR Plan Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5855)|
| 1:37:43| Density proposed is two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| Staff recommendation, approved rural residential, HP Hillside Protection because it is consistent with the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5867)|
| 1:37:56| and the rezoning, approved PR Plan Residential zoning up to 1.6 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5876)|
| 1:38:03| consistent with the slope analysis and the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| Thank you for your opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5890)|
| 1:38:16| You may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| Your name and address, please, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| I'm Robin Askew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| I'm an attorney at Lewis Thomason, address 620 Market Street, Knoxville 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5900)|
| 1:38:27| First, good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| I apologize for my attire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| I had a little Led Zeppelin moment with the civil engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| I had a communication breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| So we asked for two units per acre, and you would note in your notes, if you have that in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5920)|
| 1:38:50| that the actual residential densities in the general area would allow for two units per acre in the rural residential land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5930)|
| 1:39:01| The factors, I think, that play into the staff's recommendation to 1.6 are reflected due to the traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5941)|
| 1:39:13| and the Hillside Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| We still would ask for two units per acre and allow, as this process works through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5956)|
| 1:39:21| to take the look at this development when we go to site plan approval and subdivision plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5961)|
| 1:39:30| That's the only thing I have to say, and I'll let the staff speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| Thank you, Ms. Askew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| Chair will recognize Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| I think I'm all in favor of the Hillside Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5982)|
| 1:39:49| We should stay pretty close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| But any time that we can get two units to the acre, I'm in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=5992)|
| 1:40:00| I understand that the Hillside Protection Plan and that there are steep slopes on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6000)|
| 1:40:08| but they're going to tear up every bit as much of the vegetation to put in 1.6 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6008)|
| 1:40:20| as they do with two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| It's going to take an extensive grading on this property to make anything of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6023)|
| 1:40:31| And I'm all in favor of going with the two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6031)|
| 1:40:37| In fact, I'll make a motion that we approve two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6037)|
| 1:40:45| Excuse me, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| Right now we're on the sector plan, so you might want to deal with that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6047)|
| 1:40:53| I need to get on the right page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| Include the rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6059)|
| 1:41:05| Is that what we're?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6065)|
| 1:41:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| Because it is consistent with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| That includes the Hillside Protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| We've got a motion by Commissioner Graf, seconded by Commissioner Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| to approve the sector plan per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| Let's see, we have some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6083)|
| 1:41:27| I didn't wait for my question until after the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6087)|
| 1:41:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| I'll wait until the second motion for my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6099)|
| 1:41:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6100)|
| 1:41:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6101)|
| 1:41:42| We have a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| Move to approve the planned residential zoning for up to two units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| We have a motion and a second by Commissioner Graf, seconded by Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6114)|
| 1:41:59| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| I'm not opposed to the two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| I think there's, like you said, there's a pretty small difference between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| Speak a little closer to the mic, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6126)|
| 1:42:07| I'm not opposed to the two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| I think that that's pretty close, like Commissioner Graf said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| I would like to encourage the commission and the staff to look at the maximum percentage of disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6132)|
| 1:42:19| per the hillside protection steep slope recommendations when that comes back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6139)|
| 1:42:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| Yes, I agree with Commissioner Eason, and I would like to ask the staff to put up the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6150)|
| 1:42:38| I think this was the application where it's really pretty much in the middle of the rural area for the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6158)|
| 1:42:48| and I would like to have that shown on an exhibit on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6168)|
| 1:43:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6188)|
| 1:43:09| And my point in having this displayed is to again repeat how we are moving ahead and making changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6189)|
| 1:43:18| and looking at densities that are really not supported by the surrounding residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6198)|
| 1:43:25| One of the exhibits in the staff report shows existing lots and buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6205)|
| 1:43:31| and the chart showing building permit activity, and none of them really are strong in supporting the two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6211)|
| 1:43:42| And in fact, I think that once we get the growth policy plan revamped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6222)|
| 1:43:48| we will have a better direction on not providing this sort of, if it's 1.6, then what's the difference if we make it 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6228)|
| 1:43:58| I mean, that's kind of a slippery slope, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| That was my only observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6244)|
| 1:44:05| All right, we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| Approve PR plan residential up to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6247)|
| 1:44:12| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| Commissioner Midas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6256)|
| 1:44:17| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| Please, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6258)|
| 1:44:25| Additional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| I'm sorry, I can't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| For two dwelling units versus 1.6, which staff recommended, we're looking at 38 additional units on that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6269)|
| 1:44:36| Approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| That seems more substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| I mean, how large is each lot going to be then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6282)|
| 1:44:48| The subdivision hasn't been designed yet, but, I mean, doing the math, it would be a half acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6288)|
| 1:44:53| Half acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| Okay, yeah, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| I'm supportive of all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| I just wanted to make, we talked yesterday about the slope analysis and how we're getting these density numbers averaging down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6300)|
| 1:45:07| and I pulled up in the immediate area around there just this morning four other slope analyses that were done within the last three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6307)|
| 1:45:15| and they were all using the five units an acre on the zero to 15 percent, and they're all in Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6315)|
| 1:45:22| and they're all in slope-affected areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| There's two on this one for the flat areas, and so I'd really like us to, starting at next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6324)|
| 1:45:30| try to figure out, you know, if we've got a flat area, we should get five units an acre on the flat stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6330)|
| 1:45:36| and I think that would have probably gotten you easily the two, but I think that's where we're getting a little short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6336)|
| 1:45:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| When we come back for subdivision plan and site plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| Commissioner Easton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| I wanted to follow up on those two comments because I think that was my point is that if we hold the two dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6350)|
| 1:46:02| but those two dwelling units are concentrated on the flatter portions of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| and then we still look at the plans in terms of limiting the area of disturbance in the hillside and protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6366)|
| 1:46:13| I think that's the better balance to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| If that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6377)|
| 1:46:18| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6378)|
| 1:46:19| All in favor of the motion for two dwelling units per acre, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| I'm not fast enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6384)|
| 1:46:25| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6385)|
| 1:46:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6386)|
| 1:46:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| So just to understand, so we're looking at about 20 more acres being disturbed if you're at a half an acre unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6388)|
| 1:46:36| Is that right, or are we going to just do smaller acreage on that flatter section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6396)|
| 1:46:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6401)|
| 1:46:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6408)|
| 1:46:49| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6409)|
| 1:46:50| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| Moving on to item number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| This is a sector plan amendment rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| The applicant is Pavel and Amelia Hushtyk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| I apologize if I didn't pronounce that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| Location is southwest side of Roberts Road, northwest side of Feltridge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| Draft is 1.34 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| Present plan and designation zoning is NC Neighborhood Commercial, A Agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6437)|
| 1:47:23| Proposed plan designation zoning, GC General Commercial, and CA General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6443)|
| 1:47:29| Staff recommendation on the sector plan is to deny the GC General Commercial designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6449)|
| 1:47:36| Since this does not meet the criteria for the GC land use classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| does not meet the requirements for sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| Second is on the rezoning is to deny CA General Business zoning because it is not consistent with the Northeast County sector plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6464)|
| 1:47:54| and could cause adverse impacts for neighboring residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6482)|
| 1:48:07| Applicant, would you like to come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| Would you like to go first or would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6490)|
| 1:48:14| You'd like the opposition, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6494)|
| 1:48:18| Mr. Murphy, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6498)|
| 1:48:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| On behalf of the Knox County Planning Alliance, I'm just briefly speaking in support of the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6507)|
| 1:48:32| If you look at this intersection area out there that you've got on the other corners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6512)|
| 1:48:37| you've got Neighborhood Commercial for the sector plan designation, and we agree that makes sense when you're that far out Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6517)|
| 1:48:45| It's also consistent with having adjacent agricultural and residential uses next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6525)|
| 1:48:52| And we also support denying the CA General Commercial rezoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6532)|
| 1:49:00| CA allows for a really broad list of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| A lot of them are not appropriate next to residential structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6544)|
| 1:49:09| And CA also doesn't have a lot of the landscaping and lighting requirements that something like Neighborhood Commercial would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6549)|
| 1:49:16| I'm not sure if Neighborhood Commercial as a zone was recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6556)|
| 1:49:21| CN, that would probably be a good match for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6561)|
| 1:49:24| So that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6566)|
| 1:49:33| Please state your name and address, please, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| Amelia Gushtuk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| I'm a little nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| I'm here with my husband, Pavel Gushtuk, and thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6580)|
| 1:49:47| If you'll allow me to start on a personal note, we have God has blessed us with six children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6587)|
| 1:49:53| and the oldest four are boys, and we're very excited to have a family business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| My husband and I are both owner-operators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| And this property looked perfect for conducting a business on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6600)|
| 1:50:11| It's located on a main highway on a four-lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6611)|
| 1:50:14| We understand that it's in the sector plan of Neighborhood Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6614)|
| 1:50:18| There's a Dollar General across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6618)|
| 1:50:21| I'm glad that we don't see any neighbors here that would not approve it being rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6621)|
| 1:50:28| I was just thinking right now, the idea came to me that a retail store like a Dollar General,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6628)|
| 1:50:33| which is open early until 9 p.m., is probably a lot more disturbance to neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6633)|
| 1:50:38| than just a little family business would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6638)|
| 1:50:42| And we would probably be okay with Neighborhood Commercial, too, instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6642)|
| 1:50:49| I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6649)|
| 1:50:53| It doesn't allow for duplexes, which is one of the things that we are considering building on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6653)|
| 1:51:00| either duplexes or which CA would allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6660)|
| 1:51:04| We've looked at the zoning ordinances, and that would be something that is allowed under CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6664)|
| 1:51:12| And I wanted to go over the things that you've recommended denial on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6672)|
| 1:51:20| One of it is that it doesn't have sufficient landscape requirements to buffer it from the adjacent residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6680)|
| 1:51:26| And if you don't mind looking on this map a little bit south of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6686)|
| 1:51:35| we saw this in the corner right there, the Grant Road property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6695)|
| 1:51:43| That's actually zoned industrial, which is a very high or heavy use compared to CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6703)|
| 1:51:51| And it's almost half the size of this property that you've approved to rezone it recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6711)|
| 1:52:00| Right there, the eye, the purple eye, which is only about 500 feet away from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6720)|
| 1:52:08| This property that we're looking at, 8819, has 376 feet of frontage on Rutledge Pikeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6728)|
| 1:52:16| Rutledge Pike, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| And about 100 feet onto Roberts Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6738)|
| 1:52:25| Also, another thing you've mentioned was the lighting, insufficient lighting and skimpy signage requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6745)|
| 1:52:34| We're contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| If we need to move some dirt upon your approval, we can do that to meet any requirements needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6756)|
| 1:52:42| If we have to fill or to make this happen, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6762)|
| 1:52:48| This is about one and a quarter acre of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6768)|
| 1:52:56| And it's surrounded by mature trees already and fencing on the sides of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6776)|
| 1:53:03| There's two sides that have the agricultural zoning properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6783)|
| 1:53:11| And there's trees already and fence on both of those sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6791)|
| 1:53:20| And we looked overall at Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6800)|
| 1:53:24| There's so many CA properties south and north of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6804)|
| 1:53:30| If you want to zoom out and look for yourself, we just think that our request is reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6810)|
| 1:53:37| and we really hope that you'll reconsider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| Comments from the Commission, staff, Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| Pat, quick question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| The underlying sector plan does show what looks to me like a commercial intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6834)|
| 1:54:00| If they would have asked a see-in zone or whatever it would be in the county under that sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6840)|
| 1:54:08| would staff have supported that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| Yes, most likely we would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| I can't state that with certainty because we haven't discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| These are typically group decisions, but I wouldn't have had any issues with it personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6856)|
| 1:54:22| This is also the first I'm hearing of a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| My understanding was it was to be a contractor's storage yard, which would not be allowed in see-in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| but which would need the CA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| Correct, without door storage, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6870)|
| 1:54:33| Chair recognizes Commissioner Atkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6873)|
| 1:54:37| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6877)|
| 1:54:41| I'm just making sure I heard you right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| So a duplex would not be a permissible use in the neighborhood commercial zone, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6883)|
| 1:54:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| As part of their business, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| We would probably have recommended an RV zone or something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| But it would be allowed in the CA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| Yes, houses and duplexes are permitted in the CA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6902)|
| 1:55:07| Houses and duplexes are permitted in the CA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6907)|
| 1:55:11| But open storage is not permitted in see-in, in neighborhood commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6911)|
| 1:55:16| It's not permitted in see-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6922)|
| 1:55:23| So if I heard the applicant right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| she would be okay with neighborhood commercial zoning, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6927)|
| 1:55:33| Not preferred because we do have in mind to maybe build duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6933)|
| 1:55:38| We're not decided for sure what we're going to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| Right now we own two businesses, and we could use it for either one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6941)|
| 1:55:46| So we're kind of in the middle of deciding what we could do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| But a CA would accommodate for anything we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6950)|
| 1:55:55| Well, I would suggest that if, and I don't know that we have support for CA or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6955)|
| 1:56:01| but if we don't have it, I would certainly be open to the rezoning of neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6961)|
| 1:56:08| But I think I'll let my colleague speak a little more to see if we can understand you have support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6968)|
| 1:56:15| I'm not sure we could change to neighborhood commercial right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6975)|
| 1:56:22| That would have to come back as another application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| Because right now it's advertised as CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| We can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6991)|
| 1:56:34| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| Well, I mean, my only thought right now is rather than us sitting here trying to adjust something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=6997)|
| 1:56:42| when they don't know what they want to do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7002)|
| 1:56:45| I would almost say with 30 or 60 days, if we were to postpone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7005)|
| 1:56:49| give you time to decide what you want to do so that we can put the correct zoning on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| rather than just a blank check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7013)|
| 1:56:59| Do you allow me to ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| How would CA zoning be more, say, if your concern is disturbance to neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7022)|
| 1:57:08| how would that be more disturbance to neighbors versus the NC, which is already preplanned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7028)|
| 1:57:18| So the CN zone allows for more professional services and smaller shops and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7038)|
| 1:57:23| that are designed to service nearby residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| It's kind of what the intent of the zone and the intent of the land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7047)|
| 1:57:30| Whereas the CA allows much broader, more intense uses that we don't typically like to see next to residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7050)|
| 1:57:38| The CA and CBA zones that are existing along there, the majority of them are predating the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7058)|
| 1:57:44| Most of them are very old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| That's kind of why you're seeing that, and it's not something we like to really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| Thank you so much for answering my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| North of the property, they're old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| South of the property, a lot of them were rezoned recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| which the sector plan already existed when they were rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7079)|
| 1:58:03| This body recommended denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| That was something the county commission overturned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| Yeah, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| I don't want to get into what he said, she said, just letting you know the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7090)|
| 1:58:15| Yeah, we understand the recommendation in denial, but we hope that you'll reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7095)|
| 1:58:21| And whatever we do, I mean, we could come back in 30 days and say exactly what we want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7101)|
| 1:58:26| but whatever we do will be small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| It would be just this family business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| Yes, I'd like to make a motion, if that's timely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| You can make a motion, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7118)|
| 1:58:39| Mr. Ross?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7119)|
| 1:58:43| You can make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7123)|
| 1:58:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7124)|
| 1:58:45| I would like to proceed in a motion to uphold the staff recommendation for the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7125)|
| 1:58:57| And I make this motion because we could spend all day talking about what ifs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7137)|
| 1:59:02| but what we need to deal with is what's in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| which is a request for the sector plan amendment to allow later on the CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7145)|
| 1:59:11| and I just don't feel this area is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7155)|
| 1:59:16| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7159)|
| 1:59:23| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| I'm going to get sparklers for my...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| No, I'm just going around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7169)|
| 1:59:30| I simply wanted to say that I concur with Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| I think what he was raising up is that you look at this map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7173)|
| 1:59:37| and you see this node of CN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| and that that is a zone that is in accordance with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7180)|
| 1:59:45| It allows for that kind of, I'm going to say, gentle commercial that isn't as impactful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7185)|
| 1:59:50| We're the body to vote to have general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7190)|
| 1:59:56| The trouble is that is, I think Commissioner Smith said, a blank check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7196)|
| 2:00:02| but it means that any usage, if you and your family went on to do something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7202)|
| 2:00:08| that that usage is there, it's zoned that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| and I can't in good conscience make that vote for an area that already has CN| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7211)|
| 2:00:19| and a developed node of gentle commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| Can you tell me why 500 feet down everything is general commercial, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7224)|
| 2:00:28| It has been approved by all of you just a few years back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7228)|
| 2:00:32| I can't say that it was approved by all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| I think that goes back to what Ms. Poitier was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7234)|
| 2:00:37| but I can speak to what the map is showing in the area that you're asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7237)|
| 2:00:42| which is I can support something other than general commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| but I can't support general commercial because of what that could turn that zone into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7246)|
| 2:00:53| Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7253)|
| 2:00:57| I thought I understood this, but I don't think I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| So the present plan has NC and agricultural, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7260)|
| 2:01:05| And the zone is NC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7265)|
| 2:01:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7268)|
| 2:01:09| It's agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7269)|
| 2:01:10| The plan is NC and most of the zone is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| So we have a disagreement between those that somehow needs to be fixed one way or the other, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7273)|
| 2:01:21| I don't think there's a disagreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7283)|
| 2:01:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7288)|
| 2:01:34| Commissioner, if you could speak into your mic, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7294)|
| 2:01:36| She still has the underlying sector plan of neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| which would support a CN zone if we chose to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7300)|
| 2:01:48| but it would not allow for a more intensive commercial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7308)|
| 2:01:50| which is what we're saying we don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| Got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7312)|
| 2:01:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7313)|
| 2:01:54| I do understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7314)|
| 2:01:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7315)|
| 2:01:56| So we have a motion on the floor by Commissioner Korbelek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7316)|
| 2:01:58| seconded by Commissioner Uten to deny the GC general commercial in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7318)|
| 2:02:04| First dash recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7324)|
| 2:02:06| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7326)|
| 2:02:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7328)|
| 2:02:09| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| Chair, we'll entertain a motion on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7332)|
| 2:02:18| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7338)|
| 2:02:19| Ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7339)|
| 2:02:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7340)|
| 2:02:21| May I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7341)|
| 2:02:22| Would you like for us to entertain a rezoning of neighborhood commercial today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7342)|
| 2:02:33| Or commercial neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7353)|
| 2:02:35| We're going to appeal for CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| Then I would make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7359)|
| 2:02:43| Let's see, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7363)|
| 2:02:44| CA zoning because it's not consistent with the northeast county sector plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7364)|
| 2:02:49| and could cause adverse impacts for neighboring residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7369)|
| 2:02:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7372)|
| 2:02:53| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7373)|
| 2:02:55| We have a motion by Commissioner Hill, seconded by Commissioner Hedgesmith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| to deny CA general business per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7378)|
| 2:03:03| All in favor of the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7383)|
| 2:03:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| May I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| Why would we want to deny that when staff recommended it, I guess is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7388)|
| 2:03:14| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7394)|
| 2:03:16| On the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7396)|
| 2:03:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7398)|
| 2:03:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7399)|
| 2:03:20| I thought, I don't know, it seems consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| I can't hear you, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| I would not vote to deny the neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7405)|
| 2:03:31| They did not want it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| They said she was going to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7413)|

| 2:03:55| We're going to take a 10-minute break for everybody to kind of get their feet on the floor and walk around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7435)|

| 2:04:55| This is item number 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7495)|
| 2:04:58| Applicant is Knox Storage Equities, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7498)|
| 2:05:02| Location, north side of Middlebrook Pike, west side of Glenmoria Grove Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7502)|
| 2:05:10| Size of tract is 4.5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7510)|
| 2:05:14| The zoning is CA general business and PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7514)|
| 2:05:19| Opposed use is an indoor self-storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7519)|
| 2:05:23| Staff recommendation, approve the request for a three-story indoor self-storage facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7523)|
| 2:05:29| with approximately 103,930 square feet of floor area subject to 11 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7529)|
| 2:05:37| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7537)|
| 2:05:40| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7540)|
| 2:05:41| Mr. Mullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7542)|
| 2:05:47| We have some opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7547)|
| 2:05:53| All right, Mr. Mullen, would you like to go first or would you like the applicant to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7553)|
| 2:05:57| I would like to hear from the opposition first, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| Mr. Murphy, would you like to step up and give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| Was there somebody else other than Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| I didn't see anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7569)|
| 2:06:10| Oh, if there's no one else other than Mr. Murphy, then I can go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7570)|
| 2:06:17| Mr. Murphy said he was neutral for this one, so I've got staff approval and Mr. Murphy not opposing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7577)|
| 2:06:24| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, here for the applicant, NOx Storage Equities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7584)|
| 2:06:30| As Chairman Phillips noted, this is for a three-story indoor self-storage facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7590)|
| 2:06:35| approximately 103,000 square feet at an existing commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7595)|
| 2:06:40| This property was zoned CA in 1997 and then zoned to CA and PR in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7600)|
| 2:06:47| We do have staff's recommendation for approval subject to 13 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7607)|
| 2:06:54| The original report was for 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7614)|
| 2:06:57| but the applicant has been working with the Glenmora Grove Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7617)|
| 2:07:04| and we've also been working with Mr. Murphy, NOx County Planning Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7624)|
| 2:07:09| to continue to address some of the concerns they had, specifically with the lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7629)|
| 2:07:14| We did provide a photometric plan with our use on review that did show that we would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7634)|
| 2:07:21| the light would be less than one foot candle at the property line, which exceeds the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7641)|
| 2:07:28| But Mr. Murphy also then raised, based upon some other developments, that still met that standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7648)|
| 2:07:34| but because of the type of building and the type of lighting, there could still be some light spillover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7654)|
| 2:07:40| especially with regard to elevated properties such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7660)|
| 2:07:44| And so we agreed to also add as conditions some shielding to the wall scones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7664)|
| 2:07:49| and also some non-reflective material at the facade around those scones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7669)|
| 2:07:54| so it would not even reflect off of the building itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7674)|
| 2:07:57| which might not have been accounted for in the photometric study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7677)|
| 2:08:01| So with those 13 conditions, which the applicant agrees to, we would ask that this be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7681)|
| 2:08:09| There was some objections and some things noted in the comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7689)|
| 2:08:14| and I think there was even a petition potentially on change.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7694)|
| 2:08:18| so I do know that there may still be some opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7698)|
| 2:08:22| However, we were told from the president of the Glenmore Grove HOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7702)|
| 2:08:26| that the HOA itself no longer opposed this after meeting and explaining what the plans were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7706)|
| 2:08:33| And the objections, at least the written comments, seemed to focus on the use itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7713)|
| 2:08:39| and the fact that this is going to be commercial property instead of residential property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7719)|
| 2:08:43| and it's already been zoned commercial for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| And, of course, they also discussed not needing additional self-storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7726)|
| 2:08:53| and saying there's other self-storage in the area, and there is, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7733)|
| 2:08:57| And I think, one, that speaks to this being compatible with the existing development that's already there, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7737)|
| 2:09:04| And, two, I mean, we are in an unprecedented state of growth in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7744)|
| 2:09:11| and with additional residences and additional homes, you need additional storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7751)|
| 2:09:16| And so there's certainly a market for this, or we wouldn't be coming here and asking for them to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7756)|
| 2:09:21| So we would ask that you support staff's recommendation on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7761)|
| 2:09:25| and approve the application per the 13 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7765)|
| 2:09:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7769)|
| 2:09:30| Thank you, Mr. Malmes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7770)|
| 2:09:31| Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7771)|
| 2:09:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7777)|
| 2:09:38| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7778)|
| 2:09:40| I really appreciate, on behalf of Knox County Planning Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7780)|
| 2:09:43| really appreciate the applicant taking a look at some suggestions that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7783)|
| 2:09:47| and appreciate planning staff, Mr. Reynolds, for working on putting some verbiage on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7787)|
| 2:09:53| I'm just going to take a minute to actually do a little education because I've learned some stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7793)|
| 2:09:57| and I think it's helpful for you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| What we're all trying to do is figure out how can you have different uses located next to each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7799)|
| 2:10:04| that are more compatible, less intrusive, basically so we all get along better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7804)|
| 2:10:11| One of the areas that's problematic when commercial comes in next to residential is lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7811)|
| 2:10:16| particularly site lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7816)|
| 2:10:19| And a lot of places, you know, we're adopting the full cutoff lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7819)|
| 2:10:24| Sometimes that means full cutoff is a definition like it has to be not only 90 degrees so straight up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7824)|
| 2:10:30| but actually like 75 degrees, so, you know, a little bit downward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| I have a self-storage facility that just recently opened in the last couple months across the street from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7834)|
| 2:10:39| It's over 800 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| Their lights are, you know, at level, but I can still see direct illumination from the bulbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7841)|
| 2:10:45| I'm guessing that they probably haven't been mounted directly level, so they're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7845)|
| 2:10:49| I can actually see those bulbs directly from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| One way to get around that is something that's called a house side shield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7852)|
| 2:10:56| That's actually a shield that goes on the backside of a light that actually extends a little bit farther down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7856)|
| 2:11:01| so it provides some additional cutoff on the light that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7861)|
| 2:11:04| on the side that you might have a residence for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| So a house side shield is one way to additionally mitigate that site lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7866)|
| 2:11:11| The other thing kind of learned and they're trying to figure out how to get better on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7871)|
| 2:11:15| and it's tough to write these standards, but there's a phenomenon called wall wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7875)|
| 2:11:20| That's where you have like a wall scone that's mounted on the side of a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7880)|
| 2:11:24| The wall scone is pointed directly down, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7884)|
| 2:11:27| That's what we want, but it's still, you know, since it's mounted on the wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7887)|
| 2:11:31| the light still spills, you know, goes onto the wall behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| If you've got a bright metal building or something behind that as the building material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7894)|
| 2:11:38| you get a really bright light then casts actually a lot of glare out sideways out from the site in the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7898)|
| 2:11:44| and it's honestly as unsightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7904)|
| 2:11:47| So a way to get around that is to use darker materials and more non-reflective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7907)|
| 2:11:52| So things like that, which the applicant has graciously agreed to add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7912)|
| 2:11:56| can really help make a development in the building more compatible with adjacent uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7916)|
| 2:12:02| So we appreciate this and just wanted to take a minute to kind of walk you through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7922)|
| 2:12:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7926)|
| 2:12:07| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7927)|
| 2:12:08| Any other comments from Mr. Mullins before we move on to commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7928)|
| 2:12:12| I just have a couple for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7932)|
| 2:12:14| I mean, we can't regulate colors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7934)|
| 2:12:18| This kind of looks like a circus myself, but it's red, white, and blue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7938)|
| 2:12:22| and it's pretty obnoxious colors, but I hope that's just how it was printed off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7942)|
| 2:12:28| and not the actual color of what the building would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7948)|
| 2:12:31| Second comment is maybe require that lighting be dark sky compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7951)|
| 2:12:39| That's what is currently done inside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7959)|
| 2:12:43| Those are just a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7963)|
| 2:12:46| Chair will open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7966)|
| 2:12:47| We'll recognize Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7967)|
| 2:12:50| I wanted to make a couple of comments similar to yours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7970)|
| 2:12:53| which if you can pull up the view that shows the colored version of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7973)|
| 2:13:02| not the map, but the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7982)|
| 2:13:14| The reason I wanted to bring this up, and hopefully it will appear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| is just to draw everyone's attention to the glass usage in this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=7998)|
| 2:13:23| and the impact that that has on what it looks like from the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8003)|
| 2:13:29| and for the properties around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8009)|
| 2:13:32| It's a good usage of glass and the way that that prevents there from being just a large wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8012)|
| 2:13:41| It varies that and makes it feel a little bit more inhabited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8021)|
| 2:13:44| even though it's a space that is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| It's purposely not inhabited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| So I just wanted to commend that kind of usage as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8028)|
| 2:13:53| It may be relevant to other cases that we see in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8033)|
| 2:14:01| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8041)|
| 2:14:04| Just one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8044)|
| 2:14:05| Do we have the other two, because in our packet it's only subject to 11 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8045)|
| 2:14:09| I want to make sure before I make a motion on the 13th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| that we actually have the two other conditions written down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8051)|
| 2:14:15| Mike, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| Yes, thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| I do have the extra conditions, and Chairman Phillips does have these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8059)|
| 2:14:23| I'm going to pass a couple of them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| Michelle, if you don't mind taking those over to the other engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8065)|
| 2:14:29| I don't have enough for everybody, but the gist of it is it's condition number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8069)|
| 2:14:35| It's speaking to the two items that they had talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| adding house shields to the pole-mounted site lighting on the west side of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8078)|
| 2:14:43| which is adjacent to an existing residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| And that is a lighting plan that needs to come back to the Planning Commission staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8086)|
| 2:14:50| for review and approval before permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| And then number 13 is using non-reflective dark exterior building materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8092)|
| 2:14:58| below wall-mounted site lighting on the northwest and east side of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8098)|
| 2:15:02| which all those elevations do face residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8102)|
| 2:15:07| And, again, that's with review and approval by staff during permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8107)|
| 2:15:13| So with that, I'm going to make the motion to approve per staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8113)|
| 2:15:18| for the three-story indoor self-storage subject to the now 13 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8118)|
| 2:15:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| A motion by Commissioner Eddie Smith, seconded by Commissioner Roth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8124)|
| 2:15:27| to approve the storage facility per 13 conditions as outlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8127)|
| 2:15:33| Commissioner Korbelick, you have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8133)|
| 2:15:36| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8136)|
| 2:15:37| I am trying to reconcile the building facade as shown on these exhibits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8137)|
| 2:15:44| with the use and review criteria, which states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8144)|
| 2:15:50| the use is compatible with the character of the neighborhood where it is proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8150)|
| 2:15:56| and with the size and location of the buildings in the vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8156)|
| 2:16:00| I drove out to the neighborhood the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8160)|
| 2:16:03| and I totally don't see how this building design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8163)|
| 2:16:08| and colors and window treatment would fit in with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8168)|
| 2:16:16| That's A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| And then B, in the staff report, it was mentioned that back in 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8177)|
| 2:16:23| the Planning Commission, when looking at providing opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8183)|
| 2:16:28| for commercial buildings, rather, self-storage buildings to move into this zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8188)|
| 2:16:35| talked about how it had to have a more office appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8195)|
| 2:16:40| Now, I know that wasn't adopted as a clear standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8200)|
| 2:16:44| but I do feel that under these decision criteria about compatibility with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8204)|
| 2:16:51| that this design falls far short of what we should be looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8211)|
| 2:16:58| And I would like to ask the applicant's representative to describe to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8218)|
| 2:17:03| the characteristics of the buildings in the neighborhood and how this is compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8223)|
| 2:17:15| Thank you, Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8235)|
| 2:17:16| I think that when we were looking at the neighborhood compatibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8236)|
| 2:17:19| we were looking at that existing commercial node as well as it moves down Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8239)|
| 2:17:24| The residential neighborhoods that were bounded on two sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8244)|
| 2:17:28| one of the conditions that staff talked about is having additional fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8248)|
| 2:17:34| and additional vegetative buffer to shield that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8254)|
| 2:17:36| So when we're looking at the neighborhood, I'm looking at it as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8256)|
| 2:17:40| and I believe staff is, too, looking at their recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8260)|
| 2:17:44| the commercial node itself in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| Now, I do understand the colors are an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8268)|
| 2:17:52| and I don't know if that's actually what the colors are going to be or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8272)|
| 2:17:55| I think those are some elevations, whether that's decided upon or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8275)|
| 2:17:59| I do agree that even when there are standards such as compatibility with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8279)|
| 2:18:05| which is a bit amorphous, it's not clearly defined as to what necessarily that means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8285)|
| 2:18:10| you have to look at the objective standards as well in the zone itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8290)|
| 2:18:15| And I think this body has a great deal of discretion within those existing standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8295)|
| 2:18:22| But I do think with the commercial node there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8302)|
| 2:18:26| and with there being other self-storage facilities in that area that it is compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8306)|
| 2:18:32| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8312)|
| 2:18:34| I would agree that we do have a broad ability under the use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8314)|
| 2:18:41| and I don't feel that landscaping standards are adequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8321)|
| 2:18:45| to totally screen a building of this size and brilliancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8325)|
| 2:18:50| And I would like to have the Planning Commission at least debate and consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8330)|
| 2:18:55| tabling, not tabling, postponing this for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8335)|
| 2:18:59| so the applicant has a chance to really assess the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| and how this building might be reconfigured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8343)|
| 2:19:08| What is important in this situation is that it's the actual entrance into a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8348)|
| 2:19:15| and the property is quite exposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8358)|
| 2:19:21| We do have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| Mike, do you have a comment you want to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8363)|
| 2:19:27| Yeah, I just wanted to make sure everyone understood what Commissioner Korbelick was referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8367)|
| 2:19:32| in regard to the office, having self-storage in an office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8372)|
| 2:19:38| So in 2005, the Planning Commission approved a similar use determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8378)|
| 2:19:42| in the OB office medical and related services zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8382)|
| 2:19:46| to that indoor self-storage is a similar use to other uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8386)|
| 2:19:51| as long as it's designed similar to an office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8391)|
| 2:19:57| And the only reason why I brought that up is because the sector plan designation on the site is MDRO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8397)|
| 2:20:03| The MDRO's land use does allow consideration of the OB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8403)|
| 2:20:09| And that's why I was just referring to that, at least the Planning Commission has recognized in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8409)|
| 2:20:16| that indoor self-storage is something that is permissible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8416)|
| 2:20:20| or at least similar to other uses in an office-type zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8420)|
| 2:20:24| and that in this location, indoor self-storage is appropriate or could be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8424)|
| 2:20:30| Now that this property is zoned CA, general business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| so you kind of have to weigh those two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| It's not zoned OB like the similar use determination was discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8439)|
| 2:20:43| It is zoned CA, and anything in the CA zone is permissible on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8443)|
| 2:20:48| There's a lot of uses that could just go for building permits and just be constructed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8448)|
| 2:20:53| Anyway, I'll be available for any questions if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8453)|
| 2:20:58| Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8458)|
| 2:21:01| We have a motion and a second. All in favor of the motion, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8461)|

| 2:21:30| Located on 1.78 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8490)|
| 2:21:33| The zoning is OB office medical and related services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8493)|
| 2:21:37| That is pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8497)|
| 2:21:40| Proposed use, recovery housing for men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8500)|
| 2:21:43| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| Through the request for a recovery housing facility for substance abuse treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8505)|
| 2:21:50| For a combined maximum of 40 residential clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8510)|
| 2:21:54| Per condition number six, limited to individuals seeking treatment voluntarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8514)|

| 2:22:08| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8528)|
| 2:22:11| On behalf of the applicant, I'm David Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8531)|
| 2:22:14| She's present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8534)|
| 2:22:16| We'd like to defer to anyone that might be in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8536)|
| 2:22:20| Is there opposition present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8540)|
| 2:22:24| We do have one person virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8544)|
| 2:22:29| I'm understanding those are not connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8549)|

| 2:22:55| If you could give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8575)|
| 2:22:58| Combined, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8578)|
| 2:23:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8582)|
| 2:23:03| My name is Herb Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8583)|
| 2:23:04| I live at 8501 North Ruggles Ferry Pike in Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8584)|
| 2:23:09| I'm here today in opposition to the application for use on review for this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8589)|
| 2:23:14| of the proposed substance abuse recovery center on Nashville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8594)|
| 2:23:19| While homeowners in our community recognize the need for such facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8599)|
| 2:23:23| we feel that this location is not a fit for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8603)|
| 2:23:26| nor for the residents that will reside there for extended periods of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8606)|
| 2:23:33| This location is in close proximity to Carter Elementary, Carter Middle, and Carter High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8613)|
| 2:23:40| Many in our community feel that that alone is reason to deny this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8620)|
| 2:23:49| Also, this location does not have available public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8629)|
| 2:23:54| The closest bus line is approximately six miles from this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| I would also add that the presence of eating establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8638)|
| 2:24:01| and other businesses that would support these residents are very, very limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8641)|
| 2:24:08| There are occasional food trucks at some of the businesses along Nashville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8648)|
| 2:24:14| and one small barbecue place very nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8654)|
| 2:24:18| The current location of Soul Savage Ministries is on Loves Creek Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8658)|
| 2:24:23| down near what used to be Knoxville Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8663)|
| 2:24:28| And it's within walking distance to Walmart, which has public transportation to their parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8668)|
| 2:24:35| There are many restaurants, food cities, Sam's, Lowe's, as well as other businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8675)|
| 2:24:40| that residents of this type of facility could frequent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8680)|
| 2:24:44| The businesses also would provide possible job opportunities for residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8684)|
| 2:24:50| and I would also like to note that the coming distribution center to the old Knoxville Center location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8690)|
| 2:24:56| would be an excellent fit for residents that are in recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8696)|
| 2:25:03| I would also note that in the agenda meeting on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8703)|
| 2:25:07| there were several questions as to whether or not operators of these type facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8707)|
| 2:25:12| were required to have any certifications, license, permit to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8712)|
| 2:25:17| And I would like to inquire if that question was answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8717)|
| 2:25:21| and if that information was obtained by a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8721)|
| 2:25:31| Mike, do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8731)|
| 2:25:34| With the other, the applicant has indicated that they do not need to have certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8734)|
| 2:25:41| and also another recovery housing facility that was approved last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8741)|
| 2:25:47| also happened to contact me this week and verified that they do not require to be licensed by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8747)|
| 2:25:54| We have added a condition to address section 4.105F| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8754)|
| 2:25:59| that they shall provide a letter from the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8759)|
| 2:26:03| confirming that they do not need a license to operate prior to getting building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8763)|
| 2:26:10| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8770)|
| 2:26:15| The folks that find themselves in need of a recovery program of any kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8775)|
| 2:26:19| deserve the best possible chance of full recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8779)|
| 2:26:23| The use of these facilities at this site would be at best very crowded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8783)|
| 2:26:28| isolated from needed transportation and other conveniences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8788)|
| 2:26:32| These facilities currently have no space for outdoor activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8792)|
| 2:26:37| because of the limited size of the lot and the topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8797)|
| 2:26:40| little opportunity to have usable outdoor areas would be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8800)|
| 2:26:45| Residents in the community feel that approval of this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8805)|
| 2:26:48| would not be in the best interest of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8808)|
| 2:26:50| nor for the people that would use this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8810)|
| 2:26:54| As noted in the use on review report by MPC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8814)|
| 2:26:57| the maximum allowed residence would be 40 in the two buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8817)|
| 2:27:02| It is also noted that the two buildings would also house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| possibly up to 10 to 20 staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8825)|
| 2:27:10| That would add the potential for the crowded conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8830)|
| 2:27:14| At this time, I would like to ask that the folks in the Carter community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8834)|
| 2:27:18| and the Robles Ferry community that are opposed to this to stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8838)|
| 2:27:25| A large number of our folks were here for an earlier item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8845)|
| 2:27:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| An earlier item, and many of them had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8850)|
| 2:27:33| But we are very gathered and solid on our opposition to this facility as requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8853)|
| 2:27:44| We are concerned and we plead as a community that this request be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8864)|
| 2:27:49| Thanks so much for your time, and I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8869)|
| 2:27:53| Thank you, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| We do have Mr. Robert Vaughn that is connecting with us virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8875)|
| 2:27:59| Nick, can Mr. Vaughn hear us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8879)|
| 2:28:04| I can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| Am I coming through this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| Mr. Vaughn, we can hear you clearly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| Give us your name again and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8890)|

| 2:28:25| She's the property manager for all of her rental properties as a favor of her health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8905)|
| 2:28:33| And, you know, my wife and my sister-in-law and their family have been on that property since 1945.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8913)|
| 2:28:47| And for the community to slanderously post stuff, as the gentlemen handing out flyers have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8927)|
| 2:28:57| on stuff they know nothing about, and not knowing the full effects or program that's going to go in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8937)|
| 2:29:08| along with the ministry work and the fact that they're using the other building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8948)|
| 2:29:14| or would be using the other building until they can get into that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8954)|
| 2:29:20| because of Knox County dragging everything out for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8960)|
| 2:29:24| The team there has been very patient and very forward with giving out any information requested to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8964)|
| 2:29:38| And then you still have the slanderous members going out falsely stating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8978)|
| 2:29:46| Cody, I believe is the person that's there representing Jennifer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8986)|
| 2:29:54| they have a good program that the community needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=8994)|
| 2:30:01| There's a ton of people indeed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9001)|
| 2:30:04| I've seen it pasted all over Facebook along with my personal address and my unlisted business phone number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9004)|
| 2:30:11| that somebody from the committee there had given them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9011)|
| 2:30:19| I think that the committee needs to really look at what's going in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9019)|
| 2:30:23| instead of going off half-cocked like a lot of people in the community or actually outside the community are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9023)|
| 2:30:36| Thank you, Mr. Vaughn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9036)|
| 2:30:39| Mr. Chair, he spoke in favor, so could we take 90 seconds away from the five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9039)|
| 2:30:45| and add 90 seconds back for opposition because we do have one other person here speaking in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9045)|
| 2:30:50| I agree with that. Yes, that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9050)|
| 2:31:01| My name is David Hamilton. I'm at 1810 Merchant Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9061)|
| 2:31:05| I'm an attorney at law and have been asked to speak on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9065)|
| 2:31:13| I do object that the inadvertent time has been removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9073)|
| 2:31:18| but I would request that an additional minute be held of the time available for an actual recipient of services to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9078)|
| 2:31:30| My client is asking that the request be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9090)|
| 2:31:36| She's a church-based ministry, which has a high degree of success as compared to any other ministries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9096)|
| 2:31:47| We have here in support Greg Ghazi, who is a pastor from a church of God, also Dr. Carol Marie from Glow Ministries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9107)|
| 2:31:58| There are other persons who have attended the Soul Savage Ministries program successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9118)|
| 2:32:08| This slanderous way of approach from the opponents is not helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9128)|
| 2:32:18| I think the staff recommendation is valid and appropriate with one exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9138)|
| 2:32:24| They're asking for a letter from the state of Tennessee for a negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9144)|
| 2:32:29| The state of Tennessee has no obligation to say, no, we don't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9149)|
| 2:32:34| They have an obligation to respond to an application for permission or for a complaint, but they have no duty of response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9154)|
| 2:32:44| I would ask that the board amend that to simply requesting the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9164)|
| 2:32:49| and whether or not the state of Tennessee chooses to respond is up to the state of Tennessee, and none of us can compel it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9169)|
| 2:32:57| Her application should not be subject to such a legal nullity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9177)|
| 2:33:03| Respectfully, I've got a minute and 30 seconds left, so I can't address all the other issues that I was considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9183)|
| 2:33:12| And I would like to defer my remainder of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9192)|

| 2:34:04| Center of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services in Chattanooga, Tennessee, which it is a clinically medical-based facility, which it does have progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9244)|
| 2:34:13| and it does have a halfway house attached to it named Oasis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9253)|
| 2:34:17| But the thing is, they present a label.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9257)|
| 2:34:19| They attach a label to you that we are drug addicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9259)|
| 2:34:22| We are no longer drug addicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9262)|
| 2:34:23| We are recovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| And Ms. Jennifer Moore-Pitts is the one who has taught me that by the works of her great ministry that she has started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9265)|
| 2:34:32| So I just plead with you guys to vote in favor of this ministry because it helped save my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9272)|
| 2:34:40| And we do provide transportation to these students that are up and under me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9280)|
| 2:34:44| I will take time out of my day to drive them wherever they need, to whatever they've got to go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9284)|

| 2:35:01| That's pretty much all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9301)|

| 2:35:15| Okay, the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9315)|
| 2:35:16| Does anybody in the opposition would like to have a final word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9316)|

| 2:36:07| I recognize the need, and I'm just asking this ministry to recognize the way that they serve their residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9367)|
| 2:36:19| and the locations that they serve their residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9379)|

| 2:36:25| And we choose as a community to think that this happens not to be the correct place for this type of facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9385)|
| 2:36:34| There are conveniences that are needed to operate a facility like this and to respond to the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9394)|
| 2:36:44| And we contend that this is not the location for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9404)|
| 2:36:49| And again, my apologies for anything that was interpreted as slanderous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9409)|
| 2:36:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9414)|
| 2:36:56| Chair will recognize Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9416)|
| 2:36:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9419)|
| 2:37:00| And this is a question for Ms. Moore-Pitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9420)|
| 2:37:02| As I'm looking at the schedule, the staff schedule that's in the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9422)|
| 2:37:07| the only thing that I'm not seeing is anyone who is actually a staff member that is working overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9427)|
| 2:37:14| So when I look at this schedule, I can see from 6 a.m. to about 10 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9434)|
| 2:37:20| who is covering and observing the people who will be residing there between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9440)|
| 2:37:26| Well, I'm glad that you asked that question because I would love to explain just a little bit more in detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9446)|
| 2:37:31| the difference between a halfway house or a recovery house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9451)|
| 2:37:35| which unfortunately is the only category we fit in, versus a ministry program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9455)|
| 2:37:40| See, we are in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9460)|
| 2:37:41| We are one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9461)|
| 2:37:42| We have another six months to a year transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9462)|
| 2:37:45| After about six months, you see people like Carl here who have made progress, that are trusted, and they start interning on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9465)|
| 2:37:53| So Carl is a student intern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9473)|
| 2:37:54| He'll be graduating at the end of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9474)|
| 2:37:57| People like him are on shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9477)|
| 2:37:59| So if you see that staff schedule, you'll see that we have shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9479)|
| 2:38:02| Some of those people are actually still students in our program that have excelled to a degree that they are spiritually equipped to lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9482)|
| 2:38:12| And so this is how we equip people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9492)|
| 2:38:14| We teach them to be adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9494)|
| 2:38:15| We teach them biblical principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9495)|
| 2:38:17| I'm actually a Teen Challenge graduate out of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9497)|
| 2:38:19| There were some statements made that I wasn't qualified or whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9499)|
| 2:38:22| I would like to share that with you guys, too, that I studied under Teen Challenge for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9502)|
| 2:38:27| and so that's my qualifications, and that's how we raise people up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9507)|
| 2:38:31| That's the steps, the progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9511)|
| 2:38:33| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9513)|
| 2:38:34| I guess my question still is, and I see the interns that are in the Handiwork Marketing Kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9514)|
| 2:38:39| You know, who's actually responsible between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9519)|
| 2:38:45| I mean, I can see who's there during the daytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9525)|
| 2:38:48| I'm just…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9528)|
| 2:38:49| Yeah, the staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9529)|
| 2:38:50| I mean, all of those people that are on that list, apart from probably two or three people, are not in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9530)|
| 2:38:56| Every single person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9536)|
| 2:38:57| I mean, we have probably eight or ten in-house staff, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9537)|
| 2:39:01| We've got about four staff that are out, you know, in their own properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9541)|
| 2:39:06| So in this, that are in-house, they're counted as part of the 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9546)|
| 2:39:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9550)|
| 2:39:11| So it wouldn't be 40 plus these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9551)|
| 2:39:13| No, sir. No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9553)|
| 2:39:16| Chair recognizes Commissioner Korblick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9556)|
| 2:39:18| Yes, I had a question to the applicant and a question to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9558)|
| 2:39:23| Starting with staff, Section 4.105.01 in the standards states that there needs to be a distance between recovery hoses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9563)|
| 2:39:37| I don't remember the exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9577)|
| 2:39:38| I think it was like 1,300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9578)|
| 2:39:40| What we're looking before us are two separate lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9580)|
| 2:39:44| and one has the existing functioning recovery facility, that's the purple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9584)|
| 2:39:52| and then the other one is the application that's coming before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9592)|
| 2:39:55| Since they're separate lots, how does the applicant meet that requirement for a distance separation of whatever it is, 1,200, 1,300 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9595)|
| 2:40:06| So condition number six on our staff recommendation is basically that these two spaces operate as one facility only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9606)|
| 2:40:19| It can't be separated as two separate operations, so they have to function as one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9619)|
| 2:40:25| There's nothing in the zoning that says you can't have one operation over two parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9625)|
| 2:40:31| You see that quite often in commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9631)|
| 2:40:34| So as long as it's functioning as one operation, according to that condition, they're in conformance with the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9634)|
| 2:40:42| If they operated as two separate entities, then they'd be out of conformance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9642)|
| 2:40:47| Okay, that's what I was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9647)|
| 2:40:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9650)|
| 2:40:51| And then to the applicant, I was reviewing the activity schedule that was included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9651)|
| 2:40:57| and I didn't see any activities planned between 5.30 p.m. and 9.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9657)|
| 2:41:04| Well, we have a very tight schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9664)|
| 2:41:07| We go through different biblical studies in the daytime, and then afternoon they do their work detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9667)|
| 2:41:15| And so after that, you know, at 5 o'clock they come home, they actually eat dinner, they do devotions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9675)|
| 2:41:20| and then they have a little downtime before bedtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9680)|
| 2:41:22| Our schedule is very regimented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9682)|
| 2:41:24| It's very lined out, pretty strict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9684)|
| 2:41:26| Well, I looked at it pretty closely, and I found through the weekday five, four hours every evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9686)|
| 2:41:32| that didn't appear to have a designated activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9692)|
| 2:41:36| If you don't mind, could I have my executive director stand up and answer that question since he's in-house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9696)|
| 2:41:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9700)|
| 2:41:41| It would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9701)|
| 2:41:42| Colby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9702)|
| 2:41:45| Between 5.30 and bedtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9705)|
| 2:41:49| Could you step up to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9709)|
| 2:41:51| Yeah, my bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9711)|
| 2:41:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9712)|
| 2:41:54| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9714)|
| 2:41:56| It's Colby Jack Dittman, and I'm at 7204 Larkspur Lane in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9716)|
| 2:42:01| After 5.30, after the busy daily schedule, we have 25 men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9721)|
| 2:42:06| And so the place that we're at right now, because we're not allowed to get to this place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9726)|
| 2:42:11| we have to get all of them showers, and we also have to get them to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9731)|
| 2:42:14| So it takes about three hours in order to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9734)|
| 2:42:17| That last hour before bedtime is when they're in bed and they do devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9737)|
| 2:42:22| So if this is approved and you then have more beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9742)|
| 2:42:29| I thought that this activity was supposed to show what you will be doing, not what you're stuck doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9749)|
| 2:42:37| So in the future, should this be approved, how would those four hours every weekday evening be spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9757)|
| 2:42:45| To be honest, we try to do give a little bit of downtime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9765)|
| 2:42:48| but if needed in order to approve this that we need to make their schedule busy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9768)|
| 2:42:54| we're willing to do whatever it takes in order to get their recovery to continue doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9774)|
| 2:43:00| Well, the reason I ask is because you do show a downtime after 9.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9780)|
| 2:43:05| and I just would be more comfortable knowing that the program existed into the weekday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9785)|
| 2:43:13| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9793)|
| 2:43:15| We'd be more than happy to take care of that and keep it busy probably to about 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9795)|
| 2:43:22| What was that, about 7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9802)|
| 2:43:24| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9804)|
| 2:43:26| We know that people got to have time with God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9806)|
| 2:43:28| so we do want to give them a couple hours to hang out for a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9808)|
| 2:43:33| but they're still accompanied with staff and interns at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9813)|
| 2:43:37| There is never one moment of that day that they will not have a staff with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9817)|
| 2:43:41| from the time they wake up, from the time they go to bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9821)|
| 2:43:44| If they ever leave that property, they will always be accompanied by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9824)|
| 2:43:48| But I also want to say something about this, and this is just so the community can hear this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9828)|
| 2:43:52| but I've noticed that the comments that was given have all been given within the past month and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9832)|
| 2:43:59| And so I just want to tell people, because they were worried about what this recovery house is going to do to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9839)|
| 2:44:07| And at this point during the day, we actually go to that recovery house, and we do church, and we also do class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9847)|
| 2:44:14| So for the past seven months, we've been in that area, and there's not been any kind of chaos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9854)|
| 2:44:21| And actually, nobody's even noticed us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9861)|
| 2:44:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9865)|
| 2:44:26| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9866)|
| 2:44:27| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9867)|
| 2:44:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| My concern really is over the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9873)|
| 2:44:39| Is it required or is it not required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9879)|
| 2:44:46| I think that I would have a difficult time voting for something that I don't know if it's even legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9886)|
| 2:44:58| I'm not saying I'm for it or against it, but I think before we vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9898)|
| 2:45:06| we should know that no license is required, and we shouldn't wait until they apply for a building permit or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9906)|
| 2:45:20| I think that we should know what we're voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9920)|
| 2:45:24| And so, in my opinion, that should be part of their request at this meeting or a subsequent meeting if we postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9924)|
| 2:45:40| But I think that should be part of the package, just like we require a traffic impact study on subdivisions and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9940)|
| 2:45:52| It should be something that we actually know what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9952)|
| 2:46:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9960)|
| 2:46:01| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9961)|
| 2:46:02| Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9962)|
| 2:46:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9965)|
| 2:46:06| I think Tuesday we talked a little bit about it, and I was very inarticulate, I guess, about my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9966)|
| 2:46:12| But we're going to have legal staff see if this was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9972)|
| 2:46:18| The way I understand it now, this is not a drug treatment facility but a recovery facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9978)|
| 2:46:25| And the difference between the two is drug treatment, in my mind, involves application of drugs and things of that nature, and recovery does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9985)|
| 2:46:36| And if we approve this, can it transition into drug treatment without some type of approval from the state or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=9996)|
| 2:46:47| Did you look into that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10007)|
| 2:46:49| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10009)|
| 2:46:53| So that particular issue, of course, would be regulated by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10013)|
| 2:46:59| And the nature and character of a treatment program would have to qualify an applicant in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10019)|
| 2:47:05| It doesn't sound like that's certainly what they contemplate or what they are doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10025)|
| 2:47:09| But if they did want to transition to a different level of care, they would have to qualify to do that through state licensing provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10029)|
| 2:47:17| What is important for this body, from the perspective of counsel at this stage, for you all to be aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10037)|
| 2:47:23| is that we do have, in terms of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance, we've referenced that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10043)|
| 2:47:28| And you can see that in the stipulation or the Condition Number 7, Section 4.105 on Standards for Use on Review Approval of Recovery Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10048)|
| 2:47:40| There is a requirement, and I understand Counsel Hamilton's concern, that the state is being asked to provide something in the negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10060)|
| 2:47:50| However, that is not an arbitrary request that the Commission is imposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10070)|
| 2:47:55| That's simply a direct requirement in the regulations that apply to a standard on use of review for approval of recovery housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10075)|
| 2:48:06| Again, that's Section 4.105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10086)|
| 2:48:09| Now, there are two ways to look at that, and the Commission, I think, would be appropriate to look at it in two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10089)|
| 2:48:16| One, to require that the applicant have that letter in advance, before the vote, or to do so as a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10096)|
| 2:48:23| I think that either way would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10103)|
| 2:48:25| But under the terms of the Standard for Use on Review in Knox County Zoning Ordinance, particularly Section 4.105,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10105)|
| 2:48:34| that letter from the State of Tennessee stating that there is no requirement for a license is required under our own regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10114)|
| 2:48:43| Does that answer your question, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10123)|
| 2:48:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10125)|
| 2:48:48| Commissioner Graff, do you have any other questions related?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10128)|
| 2:48:52| Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10132)|
| 2:48:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10134)|
| 2:48:55| As I brace to maybe be the most unpopular Carter Hornet in the room right now when I give my sentiments here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10135)|
| 2:49:02| but, you know, I understand some of the community members that oppose this and are sympathetic to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10142)|
| 2:49:11| But we have an epidemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10151)|
| 2:49:16| And if we ignore it, it's only going to get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10156)|
| 2:49:21| And, you know, as part of that community, you know, I've seen so much happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10161)|
| 2:49:28| You know, I think we should be equally concerned about some of the businesses off Breakable Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10168)|
| 2:49:34| that there are known drug activity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10174)|
| 2:49:38| You had a man die there, rolled out of a car four weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10178)|
