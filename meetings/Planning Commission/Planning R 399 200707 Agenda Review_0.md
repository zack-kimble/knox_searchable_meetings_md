| 0:01:14| We've been challenged, but our staff working with consultants have done a great job of outreach and ensuring that the community is involved in the mobility plan updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=74)|

| 0:01:32| Pedestrian and bicycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=92)|
| 0:01:35| And so it's critical that we have public input and look at it because this sets the template for where our public funds for transportation will be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=95)|
| 0:01:46| And the critical document and identifying infrastructure needs of the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=106)|

| 0:02:51| Our staff wears masks when meeting with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=171)|

| 0:04:08| A couple more things. 1 is gotten some comments about sign placement and projects sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=248)|
| 0:04:15| Please keep in mind that signs are 1 of the means of notifying the public. We send notices, postcards to the owners of property within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=255)|
| 0:04:24| 300 feet of a subject property, we advertise in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| The legal ads, which is the only state statutory requirement that newspaper ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| We also place the item on our preliminary agenda 21 days before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=277)|
| 0:04:44| People were have had conversations with the office and neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| With regard to working with that office to let the contact person for a neighborhood know when there's a project in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=288)|
| 0:04:56| That neighborhood that's been derailed a bit by and trying to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=296)|
| 0:05:03| Just picking up those conversations and implementing that this calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=303)|
| 0:05:12| The final thing on signs, if you see a sign that doesn't look right, feel free to move it to where it's more visible if you're on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=312)|
| 0:05:21| Final thing is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| Vice Chair Phillips mentioned this is my last agenda review meeting. I appreciate the opportunity to work with all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| I can under state the appreciation I have for the commitment that you've made to your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=331)|
| 0:05:38| It's a tough job you have. Our goal is to build strong communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| That comes with a challenge because everyone's idea of a strong community seems to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=344)|
| 0:05:51| We're challenged each month and trying to identify the path to strong communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| A bigger challenge is that the results of the path we choose often are not known for 5, 10 or even a greater period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=358)|
| 0:06:10| Looking into the future and trying to identify what's good for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| Anticipate those needs is something that is a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| And again, I appreciate that the work that all of you have done and the opportunity you've given me to be part of that for the past 5 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=378)|
| 0:06:25| Wish you well. And I think there are great opportunities for Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=385)|
| 0:06:32| The new zoning ordinance for the city has pointed a direction for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=392)|
| 0:06:38| The mayor has instructed us to look at some planning initiatives from the east side of the community to other aspects of the city to seize on those opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=398)|
| 0:06:53| The county has opportunities. The biggest one, I think, is just updating the general plan and the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=413)|
| 0:07:00| I spoke with Mayor Jacobs about that last week and identified that both Mayor Jacobs and the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=420)|
| 0:07:07| It's a high priority task for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| Following the update of the general plan and the growth policy plan, a revisit of the county zoning ordinance to bring that into the 21st century and have it aligned with the vision for the community is a major opportunity for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=433)|
| 0:07:27| So I think there's a lot of work for you and for the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| And I'm confident that you and the planning staff will be able to undertake that task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=451)|
| 0:07:38| Again, thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| Any questions or comments from the commissioners, I'd be happy to try to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=461)|
| 0:07:49| Gerald, just let me mention that I think it would help the commission with regard to the mobility plan that maybe Jeff maybe does a short presentation on that document next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=469)|
| 0:08:05| And also for those who are new on the commission, Gerald's last day is Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| And Amy Brooks will be serving as interim director for the foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=492)|
| 0:08:21| Also, I need a volunteer or I'll appoint someone to handle the invocation and pledge of allegiance on Thursday's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=501)|
| 0:08:32| Does anybody want to raise their hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| Tim, you're scratching your head. Does that mean yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| Dory, if you don't mind, if you could send Tim a copy of the invocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| Yes, I'll take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=530)|
| 0:08:59| We'll get on to the review of the agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| First one is agenda item number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| It's Scott Williams and Associates request for rezoning on Bays Mountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| It's a small parcel rezoning plan amendment that does bring a higher density to a far eastern section of the county near Johnson University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=549)|
| 0:09:23| Liz Albertson will present the background information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| Liz, it's all yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| Okay, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=570)|

| 0:09:41| Oh, weird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| There, now you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| I think it's because I sent her the link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| Yeah, it looks like it's got my name now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| So I'm going to share my screen with you all to present through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=596)|
| 0:10:04| Can you see my screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| So this is, like Gerald said, agenda item number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| This is in the northwest, or sorry, this is in the south county sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| This is out near Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| It was Johnson Bible College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| It's now Johnson University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| It is also close to Gap Creek Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| It's at the intersection of Bays Mountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| Bays Mountain and Sevier County are further down this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| And this is Kimberlin Heights Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| So this property, again, just to kind of give you some more context about the area, this is an aerial from 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=650)|
| 0:11:01| You can see the college over in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| There's still, you know, a lot of green space around through here, not a lot of parking, not a lot of structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=665)|
| 0:11:13| This is an aerial from 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| You can see increases in the surface parking out there, some additions of new buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=677)|
| 0:11:24| And this is the most recent aerial we have from 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| You can see clearing for additional expansion of the campus that they've been doing out in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=688)|
| 0:11:37| And again, for reference, here is Gap Creek Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| The zoning out in this area is largely agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| There is some planned residential out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| There are also a few commercial zoned properties in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| One of these is a relatively new Dollar General that has gone in out in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=715)|
| 0:12:03| Another point of information is that there is a sewer line kind of in this general area that I believe may have been put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=723)|
| 0:12:14| in partnership with Knox Chapman related to some of the development at Johnson University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=734)|
| 0:12:21| This is what the sector plan, which is our long range land use plan, looks like for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| You can see Johnson University as civic institutional out here in Gap Creek Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| You can see the commercial nodes sort of identified here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| And, you know, generally on some of our more long range regional planning activities, we've shown this area as a rural crossroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=756)|
| 0:12:48| So just sort of keep that in mind as kind of a rural area where there would be a mix of uses, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=768)|
| 0:12:58| This is what the existing land use looks like for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| Again, I think this is part of the utility area. I believe this is why it shows up as public quasi-public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=783)|
| 0:13:12| And let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| Yeah, so that is it. So we are recommending approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| The petitioner has asked to go from agricultural zoning to planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=802)|
| 0:13:29| They've actually requested up to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| This is, however, in the rural area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| And we are recommending two dwelling units an acre for this at this location for planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=819)|
| 0:13:50| They have also an agricultural designation in the long range land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=830)|
| 0:13:58| And we are recommending a change to the land use plan of rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=838)|
| 0:14:05| This would allow consideration of zoning at a density higher than one dwelling unit an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=845)|
| 0:14:15| which is typically what the agricultural zone district or sorry, agricultural land use classification allows consideration of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=855)|
| 0:14:23| So we're again recommending approval of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=863)|
| 0:14:31| As noted earlier, you know, there is some history of PR zoning out in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| We don't know what they're intending to do, if it's attached units or detached units at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=877)|
| 0:14:46| They would come in with a site plan as the next step of this process through use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=886)|
| 0:14:55| If they were to try to develop this property, if they get the planned residential zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=895)|
| 0:15:02| Are there any questions about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| Liz? Yes. Under the rural residential, if sewer is available, aren't they entire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=907)|
| 0:15:14| Don't we allow people to or don't we approve up to three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=914)|
| 0:15:21| I think the growth policy plan actually mentions multiple things that kind of need to be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=921)|
| 0:15:28| It talks about sewer, it talks about being adjacent to the planned growth area for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=928)|
| 0:15:37| This is not adjacent to planned growth. It also talks, I believe, about, you know, sufficient infrastructure in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=937)|
| 0:15:51| So, you know, as of now, I feel like the, you know, all the points aren't met for that to be considered up to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=951)|
| 0:16:03| There also isn't a history of that having been done out in this area since the growth policy plan has been adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=963)|
| 0:16:11| All right. Thank you. No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| Is the housing then? Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| OK, I'm still trying to figure this out. So is the housing proposal justified by supplying units for the university?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=981)|
| 0:16:33| Is that what the change is? I mean, I would say I would say that, yes, that's a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=993)|
| 0:16:41| I mean, the fact that, you know, we sort of looked at this area on some of our long range plans as kind of a rural crossroads, it's also near an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1001)|
| 0:16:51| So looking at, you know, more opportunities for housing closer to educational opportunities and commercial areas is generally what we think of as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1011)|
| 0:17:06| better planning practice, especially for these areas that are maybe designated rural crossroads, rather than seeing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1026)|
| 0:17:16| many of the surrounding rural agricultural areas transition all to, you know, one acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1036)|
| 0:17:27| So it's a way to provide for additional housing in an area that is growing without maybe seeing as much impact on the surrounding agricultural rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1047)|
| 0:17:40| Well, if if the housing is to meet student demand and the campus has dorms on it, I just I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1060)|
| 0:17:50| It will probably end up being units that are sold unless he's proposing an apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| I'm having a little bit of trouble understanding the correlation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| As the university grows, there's also a need for faculty and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| Although I think the university historically had some housing on the campus for staff and faculty, there's no longer no longer provides that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1087)|
| 0:18:17| So there is the need for faculty and staff. I think having a certain close proximity, not only to the to the college, but to the elementary school, to park and to some within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1097)|
| 0:18:32| Rural crossroads or growth community crossroads is dictated on, excuse me, identified on some of our long range plan makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1112)|
| 0:18:44| I've got a couple of questions. Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| The first one is related to what we're talking about, the student population that this might be serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| And I had assumed when you talked about the student population just now you were talking about the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1133)|
| 0:19:02| But the it said the estimated student yield was three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| Very small. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| Okay. The other question I had was about the dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1151)|
| 0:19:18| While the designation allows up to three, the recommendation from staff is to have this approved, but with only two dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1158)|
| 0:19:30| Do I have that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| Yeah, that's correct. Except that it doesn't I mean, it's our interpretation of the growth plan that it doesn't allow for consideration up to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1172)|
| 0:19:41| That's why we're recommending two, because it doesn't meet all those things that are called out in the growth policy plan as far as infrastructure availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1181)|
| 0:19:54| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| Hey, Liz. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Could you tell me when the sector plan was last updated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| For this area, it was last updated, I believe, in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| It's pretty dated at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| Okay. Thank you. That's all I have. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| I will say we also did a planning project that touched a little bit on this area, though, when we worked on the East County community plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1217)|
| 0:20:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| And that was adopted as part of the South County sector plan and the East County sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1227)|
| 0:20:37| Okay, so that was that was kind of included in that sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| Okay, great. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| Is there a possibility that I don't quite understand the justification for the PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1246)|
| 0:20:53| If it's seven, if it's two units per acre, and there's 3.28 acres, that's roughly six or seven units and that those could be individual single family houses, particularly since it has ample frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1253)|
| 0:21:11| What is the justification for requesting PR for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| So I will say that we often get PR requests when individuals want to vary lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1277)|
| 0:21:26| Under the RA zone district, if they were to apply for that, I mean, it's pretty, the lot width, lot depth setbacks are all pretty standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1286)|
| 0:21:38| You have some flexibility with the planned residential zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| So that is my assumption for why they are applying for planned residential rather than RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1301)|
| 0:21:52| Just in, and I'm still learning, does the applicant in their application have to justify how they meet the criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1312)|
| 0:22:01| Did the applicant explain what the idea was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| Unfortunately, at the time of rezoning, that is not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1327)|
| 0:22:14| It is part of the use on review process still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1334)|
| 0:22:21| And that's when they start to describe and, you know, provide an actual site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| And ideally they would be identifying, you know, how they are creating those imaginative solutions for environmentally sensitive design and other issues on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1348)|
| 0:22:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| Any other questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| If not, we'll go to the next one on your agenda is agenda item number 12, which is a request from Piney Mountain or Piney Grove Condominium Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1374)|
| 0:23:04| If I'm not mistaken, I believe, Liz, they have requested postponement of this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| They have requested a 30-day postponement on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| But this is going to be a confusing one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| So if you all would like to go ahead and go over this now, we can, because it will likely be back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1399)|
| 0:23:30| And it's probably good to sort of see the issues identified between the zoning that's being requested and our currently adopted land use classification table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1410)|
| 0:23:45| Thoughts to proceed with this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| Proceed, let's proceed, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| So this is Piney Grove Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| This is Middlebrook Pike here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| Oh, goodness, sorry, the lights went off in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| And this is Piney Grove Church Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| This is the kind of office commercial corridor along Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1450)|
| 0:24:20| There's office parks scattered throughout the Middlebrook Pike area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| This is what the zoning ordinance, zoning map looks like for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| So we can see that there's some RN-5, there's RN-3, RN-3, RN-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1472)|
| 0:24:40| Again, there's some commercial zoning down through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| And then several of these areas came in under the older zoning ordinances as planned residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1485)|
| 0:24:56| So that basically the PR district of the county and the city, it used to be RP-1 or RP-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1496)|
| 0:25:05| And these, when the new zoning ordinance was adopted, when you see these hatched lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| that means there's basically an approved plan associated with these developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1510)|
| 0:25:18| This is what the sector plan looks like for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| You can see the commercial identified here as NC Neighborhood Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| You can see the medium density residential identified adjacent to some of the commercial areas, which is typical in a lot of sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1528)|
| 0:25:40| When you're looking to transition back to a low density residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| we often designate MDR as a transition between commercial and low density residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| I also wanted to note, though, however, you know, this RN-6 that is here is an assisted living area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1551)|
| 0:26:00| So it's a little bit of a different animal when it comes to density and how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1560)|
| 0:26:09| If that was RN-6 as an apartment complex, it would function, you know, a bit differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| However, the sector plan for this area has not been updated, I believe, well, since actually 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1575)|
| 0:26:25| So the city of Knoxville zoning ordinance was adopted after the time that the zoning or sorry, that the sector plan was updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1585)|
| 0:26:35| This is the line you can see for the sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| This is the Northwest County sector up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| And this is the Northwest City sector, I believe, down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| And we look at the zoning comparison map for the two areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| I'll try to zoom in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| You can see this is the older map that was what the zoning ordinance looked like in December 31st of 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1616)|
| 0:27:10| before the new zoning ordinance went into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| So the area in question here was zoned R-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| And these areas now are zoned R-N, let's see, R-N-5 here, R-N-3 here, R-N-3 here, R-N-5 over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1639)|
| 0:27:32| This area went to R-N-2, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| Yes, and they want to go to R-N-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| And this is to keep their existing development density that they have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1665)|
| 0:27:53| The build out at this location is 29 dwelling units an acre at this spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1673)|
| 0:28:03| There are 32 dwelling units at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| They are attached units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| It would be considered multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| And there are four buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| I think the most units in one building are up to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| The lot size is greater than an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| I think it's about 1.7 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| And they are asking to go to R-N-5 at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1710)|
| 0:28:37| So this is a comparable zone district, if you will, R-N-5 to the R-N-2 somewhat at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1717)|
| 0:28:49| So they are asking to have the R-N-5 shown for theirs as well right at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1729)|
| 0:29:00| However, we're running into some challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| And I'll show you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| When the land use classification table was adopted after the zoning ordinance was updated in November of 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1746)|
| 0:29:18| the medium density residential area allowed consideration of R-N-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| High density residential also allowed consideration of R-N-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1763)|
| 0:29:29| This is for the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| Then, sorry, when the one-year plan was being adopted in April of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1773)|
| 0:29:44| there was an amendment by city council to change the land use classification table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1784)|
| 0:29:51| So they wanted to take R-N-3 out of low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| They felt that that was too dense for low density residential and wanted to take out R-N-5 for medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1798)|
| 0:30:07| They also felt that was too intense for medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| So now we're recommending currently to deny the HDR at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1813)|
| 0:30:23| Because HDR allows consideration of R-N-6 and R-N-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1823)|
| 0:30:30| And this would fill somewhat like spot zoning at this location, or sorry, like a spot land use classification at this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1830)|
| 0:30:40| HDR does not appear on our sector plans much at all outside of the core of the city of Knoxville, sort of the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1840)|
| 0:30:53| So changing this small area to HDR does not seem to be compatible with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1853)|
| 0:31:03| But we're a little stuck right now because they're requesting R-N-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1863)|
| 0:31:10| If the land use classification table had kind of not been adjusted, you know, when we were updating the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1870)|
| 0:31:21| I'm sure Gerald could speak a little bit more fully to this than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| But when we were updating these areas, we looked at the sector plan and we said, okay, well, this area is shown as MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1886)|
| 0:31:33| So, you know, if these are going to comparable zone districts, R-N-5 would be comparable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1893)|
| 0:31:41| But then after the sector plan changed, it made some of these R-N-5 areas not compatible with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1901)|
| 0:31:51| So, you know, when we do a wholesale update of the sector plans, when we look at them again, you know, the question is, well, would we designate this entire MDR area HDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1911)|
| 0:32:06| I mean, that's, you know, that's food for thought. That's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| I think I'll jump in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| Liz mentioned that I might have something to say about the zoning of this area and the sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| Pretty, pretty bluntly and succinctly that I think city council acted without much forethought and saying that R-N-5 did not belong in the MDR classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1943)|
| 0:32:35| And that's created a number of issues that we'll be dealing with sometime because they didn't think before they acted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1955)|
| 0:32:43| And so this is one of the issues they've created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| Yeah, so I will say one, you know, R-N-5, it sounds intense, but there is a building height limitation of 35 feet in R-N-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1967)|
| 0:33:00| And we also have to remember that we're a more urbanized area and that a medium density of 30 units an acre is not high density in an urbanized area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1980)|
| 0:33:10| Again, back out in southeast Knox County, 30 units an acre would be high density, but along a significant corridor, just off a significant corridor, and in a city, 30 units an acre is not dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=1990)|
| 0:33:26| Yes, it is. And you've got R-N-5 on the east as well as the west. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| Yes. I'll go back up to the bigger map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| It's kind of sandwiched between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| It is. It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| So this is where, you know, the rub is, is that if this was still designated, if R-N-5 was still part of the medium density residential area, then it would be, I think, more appropriate to say, okay, this should be R-N-5 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2020)|
| 0:34:03| But if we say this all has to go to HDR just to accommodate this because of the change that happened to the land use classification table, you know, I think that's challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2043)|
| 0:34:19| And then, so say if this goes to HDR, then they sell and they say, okay, well, great, it's HDR. Now we can come back and we can apply for R-N-6 or we can apply for R-N-7 because, you know, we have the HDR designation now, which, you know, I don't think R-N-6 and R-N-7 would be appropriate adjacent to R-N-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2059)|
| 0:34:46| Can, is the concern the non-conforming status of the existing units or is the concern to develop that last vacant parcel in the upper right-hand corner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2086)|
| 0:35:02| And if it's to develop the last vacant parcel, you're, they can't do that with R-N-2, they would need R-N-5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2102)|
| 0:35:13| So the issue is that they currently have 29 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2113)|
| 0:35:23| And say if someone wanted to come in and buy it all up, demo it, build something else, under the R-N-2, they would be limited to townhouses and duplexes, and they wouldn't be able to get the full, the same number of units that they have now at that location because multifamily is not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2123)|
| 0:35:54| With R-N-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| Hey, Gerald, is there a potential fix, maybe sending this back to city council and asking them to revisit, reinserting R-N-5 and MDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2157)|
| 0:36:10| I think that would be a reasonable request coming from the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2170)|
| 0:36:17| And you see on the map here, we've got a number of properties built at the density that needs the R-N-5 designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2177)|
| 0:36:25| Also, if you remember, was it last month or the month before, in Esri Drive in Fountain City, there was a rezoning to R-N-5 to allow basically a sheltered living facility for Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2185)|
| 0:36:46| That was permitted and the reason that was able to be approved was that the application came in before city council revised the land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2206)|
| 0:36:58| Otherwise, that facility, which is located in an excellent place for that type of service, would not have been able to be located there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2218)|
| 0:37:07| We've got several instances of where the elimination of R-N-5 from the MDR land use classification is creating problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2227)|
| 0:37:15| A resolution from the commission asking the council to revisit that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2235)|
| 0:37:21| How does that process happen? Is that something that we would need to talk about on Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2241)|
| 0:37:30| And I'll look to Mr. Wise for this, but I think we may need some notification of that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2250)|
| 0:37:39| So, ask that be put on the agenda for next month, maybe a better approach in order to provide the notification that may be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| That was going to be my question. Can you recommend R-N-5 on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2266)|
| 0:37:53| You can recommend that. That comes to the rub of zoning is supposed to be in compliance with the general land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2273)|
| 0:38:09| So, you're not adhering to the state statute that zoning being in compliance with the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| General land use plan would make great, I think, great challenges in city council approving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| Yeah, so what I'm hearing was, what I think I'm hearing now is that the way it was zoned before the MDR, before R-N-5 was compatible with what it was prior to the rezoning and the recode, I guess, is what I'm hearing. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2301)|
| 0:38:41| Subsequent to recode, it was city council amending the land use classification table that created this talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2321)|
| 0:38:48| Yeah, so that would actually, so this is not really considered a, hey, I want to go back to the way I was request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2328)|
| 0:38:57| It is, but the city council's subsequent action on the land use classification table makes it challenging to do R-N-5 because, as Liz said, this is not an appropriate location for high density residential with the R-N-6 and R-N-7 densities they permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2337)|
| 0:39:13| But it is appropriate for, I think, for R-N-5 and a medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| But can R-N-5 be, so what you're saying is R-N-5 can't be in medium density residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| Based on city council's amendment of the land use classification table, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| Well, I have to agree with what you said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| I didn't think that through very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| No, they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| Can we get staff to kind of frame this thing up and also illustrate what we're faced with, that basically our only other option is to, well, is to deny or look at R-N-6 or R-N-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2379)|
| 0:39:53| Isn't that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| And we'll work with, to have a resolution on your August agenda requesting city council to revisit the land use classification table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2396)|
| 0:40:13| One quick question, kind of tangential to that for my own edification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| The conversation didn't seem to touch on the kind of island that any change would be making out of the R-N-1 property that would now be in the middle of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2418)|
| 0:40:32| Is that not also a concern about it being isolated in its status?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2432)|
| 0:40:42| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| I was going to let Liz go, because that's an interesting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| And, you know, with the, looking at the sector plan, the zoning somewhat not only provides opportunities for future development, but also recognizes the current land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2449)|
| 0:41:01| In this case, the R-N-1 recognizes the current land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| In revisiting the sector plan, or looking at MDR, is allowing a range of zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2464)|
| 0:41:13| The MDR land use classification would allow the owners of those properties to apply for a higher density zoning designation so that the property could be redeveloped in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2473)|
| 0:41:27| I know that's not, maybe not a direct answer, but I can put it pretty succinctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2487)|
| 0:41:36| The R-N-1 there recognizes the current land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| And the underlying sector plan allows the owner to apply for a new zoning to change the land use to provide more dense development of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2499)|
| 0:41:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| Any other questions on this one? This one was, as Liz said, a bit confusing, and you'll hear more about it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2515)|
| 0:42:05| Any other questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Okay, we'll go to the next one on our agenda, and it's agenda item number 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2527)|
| 0:42:14| It's a rezoning request by S&E Properties for property in the, Michelle, no, this is Liz too. Sorry, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2534)|
| 0:42:26| Yeah, sorry, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| You're on a roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| So, this is along Karnes Valley Drive and West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2550)|
| 0:42:39| Actually, it's West Emory Road through this area, and then it turns into Karnes Valley Drive about right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2559)|
| 0:42:46| This is Beaver Ridge Road, and this is Karnes Elementary School, Karnes Middle, and this is the Northwest Sports Complex and Karnes Senior Center over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2566)|
| 0:42:58| This is the Beaver Creek watershed, or Beaver Creek running through here, and the watershed is obviously all around this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2578)|
| 0:43:07| There's a lot of floodplain in this area, and you can see this on the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2587)|
| 0:43:16| We have a zone in the county for floodplain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| Confusingly, it's called the floodway zone, even though it's drawn to a floodway, or sorry, a floodplain designation, I think for the 100-year floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2601)|
| 0:43:33| Back when the zoning ordinance was updated to include this, I believe sometime in the late 70s, the floodway zone district was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2613)|
| 0:43:47| So, there's not an underlying base zone here. It is just floodway zone back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| So, the application is for this remaining agricultural zoned area at the top portion of the property to go to planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2633)|
| 0:44:07| and they are asking for planned residential up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2647)|
| 0:44:15| As a point of reference, this is what these neighboring subdivisions on the north side of Karnes Valley Drive and West Emory are zoned at, up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2655)|
| 0:44:29| So, they're asking for similar zoning for this area across the street, and this is what the sector plan looks like for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2669)|
| 0:44:43| When we updated the northwest county sector plan, the Karnes Crossroads area, which is what this is referred to as Oak Ridge Highway and Beaver Ridge Road area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2683)|
| 0:44:55| this was looked at, again, as like a community crossroads out in the Karnes community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2695)|
| 0:45:03| And with a lot of, you know, areas of opportunity nearby with the schools, with commercial that's happening in and around the corridor area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2703)|
| 0:45:14| we've seen a lot of growth in the northwest county sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| And we designated several areas for medium density residential opportunities that were in and around and near school districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2719)|
| 0:45:31| and in and around near, or sorry, near school locations and near commercial nodes, commercial corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2731)|
| 0:45:40| So, you can see again some MDRO over here, MDR over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| Again, they're only asking for up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| Under MDR, they could be asking for more potentially at this location, but since there is a lot of floodplain and floodway in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2752)|
| 0:46:05| the density calculation that would be done for this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| if they were to get planned residential zoning and they came through the use on review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| we would base their maximum density on this area, not the area that is part of the floodway zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2777)|
| 0:46:25| So, since it's not the entire 19 acre site, it's about a 10 acre site or so, maybe 11 acre site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2785)|
| 0:46:35| they're at five dwelling units an acre, they would, you know, have a little bit less density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2795)|
| 0:46:43| With that smaller acreage, it would be down closer to probably 57-ish dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2803)|
| 0:46:53| This is what the floodway and floodplain area looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| This is the FEMA map, the Knox County FEMA map for this area of Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2818)|
| 0:47:05| The red line on there is the no-fill area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| Knox County designates a no-fill area, I believe, on some of their studied streams and waterways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2830)|
| 0:47:17| Beaver Creek is the largest watershed in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| so this has naturally been a heavily studied area where they've looked at flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| And when we reached out to Knox County stormwater, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| they told us that this area outside of the no-fill area is actually about nine acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2850)|
| 0:47:38| So, you know, typically you can't build habitable structures in floodplain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2858)|
| 0:47:46| So, but, you know, this is in close proximity to schools and commercial areas and under planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2866)|
| 0:47:57| since they do have flexibility with their lot sizes and their type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2877)|
| 0:48:04| You know, again, we won't know until the use on review process what they're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| They could potentially, you know, propose townhouses, you know, outside of the floodplain in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2889)|
| 0:48:17| We, you know, honestly just don't know what they will propose because we don't require a plan at the time of rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2897)|
| 0:48:26| So, you know, there could be opportunity to be imaginative for the area outside of the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2906)|
| 0:48:37| So we're recommending approval of the up to five dwelling use maker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| and hope that we'll get something creative that takes into account the, you know, issues in the area related to flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2923)|
| 0:48:54| We've had a lot of comments related to flooding voiced by the community, as well as traffic concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2934)|
| 0:49:02| I will note that this Carn Valley Drive is relatively new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| It's been constructed within the last probably 10 to 15 years or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| So there have been some road improvements in this general area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| and there has been a lot of new infrastructure improvements as far as the senior center and Northwest Sports Park out in this area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2956)|
| 0:49:28| Liz, what was the area, how many acres would be developable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2968)|
| 0:49:35| So when we talked to Knox County Stormwater, they noted that this area outside of just the no fill line is about nine acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2975)|
| 0:49:50| But when we do the analysis for density based on zoning, we would just look at what is not in the floodway zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=2990)|
| 0:50:02| So it would be this 11 acre area density would be based off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3002)|
| 0:50:09| The rezoning report shows 1.16 acres. Is that an error?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| Yes, I'm sorry. That is an error. I believe the staff report and the database has since been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| We can issue a blue sheet to that. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| Yeah, sorry. Hang on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| So you would base your density on the area outside the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3032)|
| 0:50:39| But the county would be saying the only thing that would be developable would be outside their no fill area, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| So you'd have a higher, a little higher density on the remaining nine acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| Right. So it appears that the planned residential area is about, I mean, just using our estimating tools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3054)|
| 0:51:06| it looks like it's about eleven and a half acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| So at five dwelling units an acre, they would potentially get 57 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| And I will say we often get requests for up to five dwelling units, you know, pretty regularly as a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3076)|
| 0:51:26| And sometimes they don't actually build out at that density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| So the floodway zone is eight, about eight point two acres of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3091)|
| 0:51:38| And so that would not be counted towards the possible density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3098)|
| 0:51:47| Liz, a couple of questions. Just to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| Well, this is actually a statement to make sure I've got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| The cause of the floodplain or flood area, no matter what the maximum zoning would allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3115)|
| 0:52:07| the most that would ever be allowable would be that 57 units total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| Yes. I mean, you know, they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| This is a little bit of an estimate that that number because they could come in with a survey that shows much more detail and say, hey, this is actually what our acreage is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3136)|
| 0:52:28| So, you know, that could give them, you know, probably another dwelling unit here or there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| Again, since we don't require a plan at the time of rezoning, it's hard to know exactly, you know, what that acreage is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3154)|
| 0:52:43| The follow up question is, we received a few comments from the public about traffic concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3163)|
| 0:52:52| How does the traffic consideration play into your report at this stage in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3172)|
| 0:53:00| So, you know, we have an algorithm that we follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| It's the AASHTO standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| It's, you know, the Society of Transportation Engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| They put out these numbers based on land uses and trip generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3195)|
| 0:53:21| So if this were hitting the, I think the local ordinance, or sorry, the local policy for what would trigger a traffic impact study, I believe is currently, and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, anyone, any other staff that's listening, 75 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3201)|
| 0:53:47| And under single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| So if they were to try to, you know, build that many, it would trigger a transportation impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3231)|
| 0:53:59| However, since this is now at, that would have to be submitted at the time of use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3239)|
| 0:54:06| And then that would get reviewed by our transportation staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| Right now, we just have the number that gets generated based on the zone district that they're requesting and the acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3251)|
| 0:54:21| And we are making a little bit of an assumption that they're going to do detached dwelling to generate that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3261)|
| 0:54:29| If they were doing attached units, the student yield number would go down even less, or would go down less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3269)|
| 0:54:37| And I guess it's, you know, assumed that the, I think it might be assumed that the number of trips would drop a little bit too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3277)|
| 0:54:51| So, you know, again, it's a little bit of an estimate, but we at least do have kind of a national standard that we can refer to that generates number of trips based on assumed land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3291)|
| 0:55:13| Hey Liz, this is Mike. Just wanted to clarify real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| The 75 unit, dwelling unit for detached used to be the number for requiring a traffic impact study or transportation impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3317)|
| 0:55:27| But now it's 71 is the threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| And really what we're looking at is 750 trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| So whatever generates that amount of trips is when a traffic impact or transportation impact study is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3336)|
| 0:55:46| I saw that it's estimated as 620 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| So that's beneath that 750 that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| Any other questions regarding this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| If not, we'll go to item number 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| No, I'm sorry, number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| This is a sector plan and a rezoning request that would enable currently non-conforming use to become conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3370)|
| 0:56:20| I think you've got some comments from the residents of Idle Lane regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| And Michelle will provide an overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3385)|
| 0:56:34| Sorry, I had to unmute myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| Okay, so this one is on Idle Lane, as Cheryl said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| You can see here it's pretty far out in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| There's not a lot going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| Very, very rural country roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| Very big lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| Idle Lane itself is a single lane road, very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| Looking at the sector plan map, it shows agricultural pretty much as far as you can see in either direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3415)|
| 0:57:02| And then looking at the zoning map, there are some spots, some commercial nodes, but these are all along the intersections of arterials, collectors, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3422)|
| 0:57:12| So we're recommending denial for the sector plan and for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| For the sector plan, it would be considered spot land use designation because there's nothing else like that around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3437)|
| 0:57:25| But also it just doesn't meet the criteria associated with general commercial designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| So to give you a little bit of a history behind this one, the owner of this property went to the BZA and got approval to do an accessory structure between the primary structure and the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3450)|
| 0:57:43| And so I've got some street views of what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| So this is the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| It's actually pretty big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| It's a three-bay garage, and he uses that to do some repair of diesel vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| When he first built the structure, it was just him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| It's since grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| Now he's got three employees, and I feel like it runs pretty consistently at all times during the day with business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3480)|
| 0:58:07| It's always in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| Once it got larger, I believe one of the neighbors complained, and Knox County went out and told him that he had to cease building operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3489)|
| 0:58:17| So his rezoning request is to, I guess, retroactively make the use of the land match the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3497)|
| 0:58:25| So that's kind of what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| And so we were looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| Knox County recommended that he ask for CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| That was the zone that they said they would allow this particular use in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| And so none of the designations that allow CA really fit this area that cleanly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| So community commercial, that's based on big-box development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| Regional commercial is retail and service-oriented development that meets residents, typically exceeding 400,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3524)|
| 0:58:53| So clearly neither one of those are fit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| So that's why we're recommending, or that's why we had him ask for the general commercial designation on his application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3536)|
| 0:59:03| With that said, again, we're recommending to deny, just based on the fact that there's no other land use designation like that around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3543)|
| 0:59:11| And looking at, this is the area beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| This is East Emory here, and then Iowa Lane, as you can see, pretty narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| That's what it looked like before, and then that's what it looks like now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| And so East Emory is a T-dot road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| He'd have to get T-dot approval to change the access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| And I know there's tow trucks coming through there at all times with these diesel vehicles coming down Iowa Lane, which services, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3568)|
| 0:59:35| there's six private driveways to get to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| And the houses are all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| This is his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| This is the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| The houses are all along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| And this is how the path of the tow trucks would take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| So that pretty much sums up this one, unless anybody has any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3589)|
| 0:59:56| Any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| If no questions or comments, we'll go on to item number 15, which is a sector plan rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| and one-year plan to allow the development of a crematorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3610)|
| 1:00:17| So this one, the only reason you're seeing it is because it's got plan amendments associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| We feel like it meets the criteria for a sector plan amendment and for rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| We haven't had any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| The applicant is subdividing this small piece of property off of the larger piece here in order to meet the next phase of this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3630)|
| 1:00:40| which will be the special use permit for the crematorium attached to this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| And so one of the criteria for that is for the smoke stack to be located more than 500 feet from a residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3645)|
| 1:00:52| And so this is kind of just rough measurements taken from the property boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| You can see they're all well above 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| They're all above 1,000, so it would definitely meet that phase of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| And looking at the area, there's a lot of light industrial uses along in this area, commercial uses down through here on Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3662)|
| 1:01:10| This is that existing land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| So there's quite a mix of uses, some utilities in the area, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3672)|
| 1:01:20| Sector plan amendment would be needed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| Even though it's not contiguous, this is LI along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| There's commercial designations through here that are, again, it's that community commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| That's a bigger scale that we just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| So we didn't feel like GC was out of character with the rest of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| And same thing for the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| You've got some CH1 across the way, CG1 along Western through here, and it's the residential properties that are kind of behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3698)|
| 1:01:46| And so we felt like that this would not be out of character in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3706)|
| 1:01:52| And so the reason they're having to ask for rezoning is because crematoriums aren't allowed in the open space zone, but then cemeteries aren't allowed in the CG zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3712)|
| 1:02:02| So there had to be that separation between the zones as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3722)|
| 1:02:10| Does anybody have any questions about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| Is our crematoriums allowed in the industrial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| Did you mention whether they were allowed in the IG zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| Or maybe I didn't quite catch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| I'd have to check to see if they're allowed in the IG zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| I believe it was the CG we felt like was probably more appropriate, just kind of given the general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3750)|
| 1:02:37| The only reason I ask is there's no concern about spot zoning, is there, if you go commercial like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3757)|
| 1:02:47| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| With the commercial along the highway and the commercial uses across the street, I think there's no real concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3769)|
| 1:02:57| The vision for Western Avenue is that CG type of commercial that is oriented to both pedestrians and motorists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3777)|
| 1:03:10| So this is zooming out a little bit just to give you a little more context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| A lot of commercial through here, some down here, and then the light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| Some of these uses in the industrial are actually commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| If one of these is a dollar general, one of them is, I believe, rental of costumes or something, not costumes, uniforms, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3801)|
| 1:03:30| So they're not really, I wouldn't really classify them as light industrial uses, even though they have that designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3810)|
| 1:03:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3817)|
| 1:03:44| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| Okay, now we'll go on to, from rezonings and plan amendments to concept development plans and use some reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3827)|
| 1:03:55| The first one is on agenda item number 17, Brock Point development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| This is an unusual subdivision in that it's a subdivision type that shows a new road construction and Michael provided an overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3840)|
| 1:04:10| Yes, thank you, Daryl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| So the three plans I'm going to review were all coordinated by Tom Breczko.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| So if there's a question that I cannot answer, I will get an answer to you as soon as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3860)|
| 1:04:26| But hopefully these will be straightforward enough that we can get it all taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3866)|
| 1:04:33| So this first one, Brock Point, the property is zoned predominantly IG, which is an industrial general zone in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3873)|
| 1:04:44| And then it also includes some properties down towards Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| So really it's a development that includes a new road from Rutledge Pike to Spring Hill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3888)|
| 1:04:57| I'll bring it back in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| So again, so Brock Point to the east, well actually Spring Hill Road to the east, and they're going to make this transition into what they're calling Brock Point Drive and then down to Rutledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3900)|
| 1:05:12| This is primarily to create an industrial commercial business development along the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3912)|
| 1:05:20| It's already kind of used for that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| This also increased connectivity between, or on this side of, southeast side of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3924)|
| 1:05:34| Brock Point, I'm sorry, Spring Hill Road does actually go up to connect back into Rutledge Pike here, so this kind of creates a bypass around the intersection of Rutledge Pike and the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3934)|
| 1:05:52| And then Spring Hill Road also kind of connects over to the north side of the interstate as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3952)|
| 1:05:59| But really, this is trying to create a business park along the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3959)|
| 1:06:07| NACDA is recommending postponement at this time because they're creating a collector street. The subdivision regulations are really geared toward standards for local streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3967)|
| 1:06:19| When it comes to collectors, they need to meet the City of Knoxville's engineering standards, which also is the AASHTO transportation standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3979)|
| 1:06:34| And the city staff and TDOT still have changes they want to see before the road gets finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=3994)|
| 1:06:45| So I think it's a staff recommendation for postponement. I think the applicant kind of understands the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4005)|
| 1:06:53| They haven't specifically requested a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| I don't know if they're going to necessarily try to get this approved right now, but there's some issues that still need to be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4017)|
| 1:07:04| So if anybody has any questions at this time, I'll be happy to help out, but that's kind of where we're at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4024)|
| 1:07:14| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| I was just wondering, when you have the industrial right up next to a single-family residential, does the industrial require any form of buffering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4038)|
| 1:07:30| If it's adjacent to residential and it's new development, there's, I can't remember, I think it's a 50-foot setback and there's a 20-foot landscape buffer that's required in that setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4050)|
| 1:07:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4062)|
| 1:07:48| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| Now we'll go on to the next one, agenda item number 18, this Cherokee landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| This is one that Tom discussed, I believe, last month where the subdivision is requesting a revision or elimination of one of the conditions requiring a sidewalk, an internal sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4078)|
| 1:08:14| And staff is recommending a new condition that has been worked at that would provide for pedestrian connection to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4094)|
| 1:08:23| Mike can provide some information, and again, this was Tom's project, and as Mike said before, if you have questions he can answer, we'll get the answers for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4103)|
| 1:08:36| So as we discussed last month, the request is to remove the sidewalk condition, which has a sidewalk on one side of the street and all the streets right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4116)|
| 1:08:50| Those sidewalks have been bonded, and so the original condition also had a sidewalk along Cote Neat as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4130)|
| 1:09:01| So what has transpired since the last Planning Commission meeting, the applicant has met with the County Department of Engineering representatives from South Federal High School and County Commissioner Carson Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4141)|
| 1:09:19| And what they originally were kind of hoping to do would be to have a sidewalk connection along this development's frontage, and then have the developer, along with Knox County, participate in extending that sidewalk all the way down to Tipton Station where there's an existing sidewalk, and that would get you over to the schools and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4159)|
| 1:09:43| Ultimately, engineering determined that they don't know what kind of right-of-way they actually have here along the southern section of Cote Neat Road, so they were a little bit hesitant to get into an agreement to extend that sidewalk all the way down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4183)|
| 1:09:59| And so what the engineering and planning staff have come to would be to request this sidewalk along Cote Neat, along where the development is, and then turn east towards the back of the school property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4199)|
| 1:10:19| What you see is this tree here. It's a large specimen tree that was actually called out for protection during the original approval. So the sidewalk would go around that tree to protect it, and then there would be a sidewalk connection from this cul-de-sac that would allow residents of the subdivision to get down into the school property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4219)|
| 1:10:43| So if you're looking at the aerial, maybe what you'd see is a sidewalk along Cote Neat Road. It would turn along the property boundary around this big tree and then terminate into the school property about here, and then there'd be a sidewalk into the subdivision where the cul-de-sac is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4243)|
| 1:11:06| I have a quick question on that one. Is the school system fine with the sidewalk coming into the back end of the freshman campus over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4266)|
| 1:11:20| Yes, they're fine with that. They just requested that it be as close to the western boundary as possible. So that's why that sidewalk terminates where it does, as far west along that property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4280)|
| 1:11:41| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| On the existing plan, is there a sidewalk on Cote Neat Road, or is that new to this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4306)|
| 1:11:57| There was always a sidewalk requirement on Cote Neat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| So the only thing that's being added is the small park down in the lower left-hand corner. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4322)|
| 1:12:09| That's correct. That's correct. And then the elimination of everything else that's in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4329)|
| 1:12:21| Mike, have all the property owners agreed to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| That I don't have an answer to. I don't think there's an agreement or anything between all the property owners. I'll have to find out about that and let you know exactly what has transpired there. I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4344)|
| 1:12:39| You know, my concern on eliminating sidewalks or any improvement on a subdivision that has been platted and approved by the Planning Commission and recorded and property sold, and as we all know, all the property owners end up paying for these improvements, and they're not getting what they were supposed to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4359)|
| 1:13:10| And I think it puts the community, the Commission, in somewhat of a difficult position, because the bond or a letter of credit, whatever is used for surety is there to be used to make sure that those improvements are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4390)|
| 1:13:31| And by accepting that surety, we're required to make sure that those improvements are completed as we approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4411)|
| 1:13:43| And this is the subdivision that's not actually built out yet. Is that correct, that most of it still hasn't been constructed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4423)|
| 1:13:50| That's correct. Most of it has not been constructed. There's more. Let's see here. Turn on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4430)|
| 1:14:09| You see, this is about what's been constructed so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| Hey, Mike, what is the justification that the applicant is using for relief on the internal sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4453)|
| 1:14:21| Did he just not want to spend the money, or is there some other issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4461)|
| 1:14:29| Let me see if I can see if they put it on their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| My guess is they don't want to install it because of financial reasons, but obviously they have not installed any sidewalks to date, so having to go in and install sidewalks now would be more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4472)|
| 1:14:52| But I'll check and send that out to you and see if there's a justification on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4492)|
| 1:15:01| I think the justification is asking for goodness rather than permission is easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4501)|
| 1:15:07| I mean, the reason I say it is because, you know, prior to sidewalks being required in every subdivision, at a minimum, we always had sidewalks in the parental responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4507)|
| 1:15:20| Close to a school. And so, you know, it's right next to a school. I just, I wondered why they wouldn't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4520)|
| 1:15:34| Can I make a statement, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| One thing that I think that we all need to think about is are we setting a precedent here for future developers to say, well, that was the condition, but I'm not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4538)|
| 1:15:53| And I think that we need to really think about that. I think we could cause ourselves a lot of trouble in the future that, you know, rules don't have to be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4553)|
| 1:16:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| The other thing, and Scott, you're probably more familiar about this than me, but when they, and I agree with what you said, Gail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4568)|
| 1:16:17| The other argument they may make is, let's see, well, some of those sidewalks intersect with the driveways now, and so to get the ADA slope to meet the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4577)|
| 1:16:34| Dick, what's your thoughts on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| Can you hear me? Okay. My thoughts on that are when this was first proposed back two or three months ago, there were only about two locks that would be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4599)|
| 1:16:57| And last month, there were only four. It's on the inside of your map that you're looking now. On the inside of the loop there, there had only been a few driveways poured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4617)|
| 1:17:10| So it really didn't matter. And I'm sure when he requested this, there probably weren't any driveways poured. So I don't think he had any intent of ever doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4630)|
| 1:17:26| The other thing is, I've had sidewalks removed from a small subdivision. I did 33 lots. We called for sidewalks. The people did not want the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4646)|
| 1:17:41| Every person in the subdivision or every lot owner had to sign off on it. And I'll add, in addition, I made a contribution to the Homeowners Association, but they said they didn't want sidewalks closer to the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4661)|
| 1:18:05| They didn't want people walking in their front yard. It was their idea. But I agree with Pat on this that, you know, it was sold that way and it either should be put in that way or he needs to get all the homeowners to agree that they don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4685)|
| 1:18:27| One thing I would say that we ought to consider also is that if he's built driveways and people are living in there and the sidewalks were not put in, to go back and put them in and make them ADA compliant might require everybody to have their driveway removed and repoured and regraded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4707)|
| 1:18:48| And I'm not sure that that helps the residents that are already there more than it hurts them. And I think it would be good to hear from some residents about what they want in this situation because, you know, if he has to put them in, they have to be ADA compliant. And that may mean tearing out a whole bunch of people's private property that they may not even allow him to do. Just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4728)|
| 1:19:12| I have two comments. One is that as a mom raising kids, I always prefer to home with sidewalks for the safety of the children. It was a huge factor for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4752)|
| 1:19:26| And the other is when they're doing the engineering, the civil engineering for the subdivision, they should have already calculated the alignment of the driveways with the future sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4766)|
| 1:19:42| Otherwise, well, they would just have figured that out. So I'm not too worried about ADA compliant. If he fully intended to put in sidewalks initially, he would have engineered the driveways and the sidewalks so that they would flow correctly. That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4782)|
| 1:20:01| Yeah, that's not exactly how it works. But, you know, in the field, when driveways are poured and I mean, you have to you have to lay those driveways with sidewalks in mind and it's not really engineered on the plan that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4801)|
| 1:20:18| And if I can jump in for just a second, the only thing that I would say is, you know, sidewalks inside or out, if it's in the plan, considering the fact that we were looking at what the right of way of the rest of company road that would connect to South dual, perhaps we could just look at going back to the developer and having him finish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4818)|
| 1:20:37| And if we don't require inside the neighborhood, because company road is already narrow with a lot of traffic on it from the school, that could put more people at risk in an uncompleted section as they're trying to get to the school for those last two properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4837)|
| 1:20:53| I think if you have one homeowner that wants sidewalks, they're entitled to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4853)|
| 1:21:00| Because they bought that lot with the with the plan of sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| And I would agree. I'm saying if the all the homeowners sign that they don't want them put in, that would be a big step is they need to complete it to the school so that it's a safe sidewalk all the way to the school from the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4865)|
| 1:21:17| And I believe that last month, we did ask that the developer go and discuss it with the residents. So if there's no word that that's happened, then, like Dick was saying, I don't know that they ever intended to. I think we have to weigh the costs, the pros and cons of setting a precedent of being able to just go back on something that was approved previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4877)|
| 1:21:42| And I would think that there's a strong likelihood that those homes, the people who have already bought and they're already there, or they're seeing their home constructed are assuming that if they were told a sidewalk was going to be put in, that that's just the last thing that's going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4902)|
| 1:22:01| So they're assuming that's happening. They may not understand some of the engineering components or other likelihoods. So I think it's imperative that they.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4921)|
| 1:22:14| They be aware of it being a question at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| So, Gerald, the case file says that the applicant is requesting the removal of the sidewalk condition based on Knox County's recent changes regarding sidewalk standards for new residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4938)|
| 1:22:31| And is that normally something that's allowed after the plans already been approved and lots purchased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4951)|
| 1:22:40| We're getting a few requests that for elimination of sidewalks as required in subdivisions when they were approved based on the new standard from the ordinance adopted by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4960)|
| 1:22:58| So we do accept those requests and it's up to the commission on a case by case basis, whether to remove that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4978)|
| 1:23:07| Is there a bond in place and is it in the parental responsibility zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4987)|
| 1:23:14| This is within the parental responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| Well, the county regulation doesn't. It still says that in the parental responsibility, there are sidewalks required. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=4998)|
| 1:23:27| But the county engineering and public works may require a sidewalk and within the properties within the parental responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5007)|
| 1:23:36| No, it says may. I thought it said that was one of the one of the areas where they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5021)|
| 1:23:49| So what's what's engineering saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| What's engineering saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| Engineering is in a is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| Engineering is in agreement with this design. This is what their preference is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| Long Company Road sidewalk along Company Road in this, you know, sidewalk extension over to the school property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5048)|
| 1:24:15| Along with the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| I mean, the bottom line really is, doesn't engineering hold the bond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| I mean, they can release the bond if they want to. I mean, I'm not even sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| I think I think to a certain extent, we have to kind of listen to what engineering says a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5067)|
| 1:24:33| I mean, if they feel like this is a good option and they're the ones holding the bond, am I wrong on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5073)|
| 1:24:39| And we don't hold the bonds, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| Oh, but we approve the plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5081)|
| 1:24:47| I personally believe whatever county commission did this past year regarding the sidewalks is not relevant to this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5087)|
| 1:24:55| And what what engineering says is not relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| Yeah, we're here to protect the owners of these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| Make sure they get what they pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| Have we heard from any of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| I'm not aware. We did last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| There is a property owner that's nearby that has been local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| I really don't recall if there was someone in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| It would seem to me that other than have a sidewalk on Courtney Road, if internal sidewalks and connected them to the to the school, that would be a whole lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5122)|
| 1:25:38| Can we look at a compromise where we relieve some of the need for a sidewalk where there's, say, a cul-de-sac?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5138)|
| 1:25:45| And then also ask for that connection to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| Can we do a little bit of both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| I wouldn't ever have to go out on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| And we look at a compromise where we relieved some of the need for a sidewalk where there's, say, a cul-de-sac and then also ask for that connection to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5157)|

| 1:26:30| On a subdivision, you have more leeway than on a rezoning. I agree with Dick, it's challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5190)|

| 1:27:25| driveways and put in a sidewalk. It'd be different if we were 10 years down the line. I personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5245)|

| 1:28:34| job to just say, well, let's protect the homeowners. And if that's saying, do it like you submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5314)|

| 1:30:17| They would have to submit a revised plan showing no sidewalk. That would be reported. So that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5417)|

| 1:30:51| Yes, thank you, Gerald. So the property is on PR. This is the third time this has come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5451)|
| 1:31:01| back to us. So Neal's Landing subdivision is partially built out up front. It connects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5461)|
| 1:31:10| to Asheville Highway at the Breakville intersection. There is a small commercial building kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5470)|
| 1:31:18| of tucked back into this area. I think it's used as a church now. But their intent is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5478)|
| 1:31:24| to extend Neal's Landing Road into the site as well as Vista View Lane. And they'll also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5484)|
| 1:31:34| extend the development into this area. Just so you know, the road that does come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5494)|
| 1:31:45| this way in their development will stub out at the shore of the creek. That's their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5505)|
| 1:31:53| basically their development line at this point. The rest of this property is PRed here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5513)|

| 1:32:06| development. So let me get the plan up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5526)|
| 1:32:12| So this is the overview of the development. Neal's Landing is here. This is what comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5532)|
| 1:32:23| from Asheville Highway. So it'll extend into the site and then terminate into a new road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| towards back to the property. And then Vista View Lane, which is to the east, will also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5548)|
| 1:32:35| be extended and will connect back over to Neal's Landing Road. So there's a small cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5555)|
| 1:32:41| and now this development will come around on the west side of the property to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5561)|
| 1:32:45| cul-de-sac. So I'm going to show you the original plan real fast just so you get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| context of what was done originally. Let's get to this page. Here we go. So this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5569)|
| 1:33:00| the original plan that had Vista View Lane terminated in a cul-de-sac. This little first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5580)|
| 1:33:10| cul-de-sac off of Neal's Landing Road is essentially in the same place. They showed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| a future street connection to the west, which is partially being incorporated into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5594)|
| 1:33:20| development. And then Neal's Landing Road is kind of curved up around the west side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| of the property to the north and cul-de-sac. This plan, this is from 2018, it did have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5604)|
| 1:33:31| an open space play area with an easement back to Neal's Landing Road. And this original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5611)|

| 1:33:48| commercial building are all kind of modified to work with the new street layout. So I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5628)|

| 1:34:19| revised concept plan. The plan in this case didn't change a whole lot. The road network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5659)|
| 1:34:26| was pretty similar, only they extended this cul-de-sac on the north side of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5666)|
| 1:34:31| just a little bit further to get a few more houses in. Let me zoom in a little closer here, if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5671)|
| 1:34:40| There it goes. In this plan, so in the 2018, the original plan, there was also a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5680)|
| 1:34:53| for sidewalks and also a sidewalk connection that goes from, you can see in the sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5693)|
| 1:35:01| goes from Vista View Lane down to this little cul-de-sac road. Since these roads did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5701)|
| 1:35:10| connect, there was a cul-de-sac here and you had Neil's Landing lower, somebody was on this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| they had to go pretty far out of the way to get back to somebody right behind them. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| why that was there. This plan still includes that sidewalk connection, even though the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5720)|
| 1:35:26| actually do now connect. Sidewalks are still included in this plan. You know, in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5726)|
| 1:35:34| we've kind of looked at sidewalks when they're not a requirement, like they're not on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5734)|

| 1:36:31| There's really nothing too much different from this approval to the last. They did require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5791)|
| 1:36:43| in the original development, a traffic impact study, which identified two improvements that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| need to be made. One is the Asheville Highway, which is extending the left turn lane here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5808)|
| 1:36:56| They extended 100 feet. Or, I'm sorry, they had to extend it from 100 feet to 160 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| so this would be a little bigger. Then they also needed to stripe the end of Neil Lanning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5822)|
| 1:37:09| Road and then create crossbars, so just kind of visually improve this intersection here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5829)|
| 1:37:17| That's what that traffic study ended up something. If anybody has any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5837)|
| 1:37:25| I'll be happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5845)|

| 1:37:35| On the sheet, it says there's 25.1 acres and 142 lots, and if you turn the page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5855)|
| 1:37:45| it says we're going to have a density of 3.76. How does that compute? I can't make that work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5865)|

| 1:38:15| It's possible, but that's an overall density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5895)|

| 1:39:06| seen so far. A more detailed plan will come later when they get to the design plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5946)|
| 1:39:13| Stage. So at this point, county engineering was happy with what they have done on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5953)|
| 1:39:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| Tell me again. I know you said it, but my head didn't understand it. What is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5966)|
| 1:39:31| you said this is a revision from the second revision, but the second revision had already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5971)|
| 1:39:40| included that extra little PR lot. So what's the difference between this one and two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5980)|
| 1:39:48| Okay. So in the second revision, the one from 2019, Neal's Landing Road, which is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5988)|
| 1:39:56| kind of came up and swooped and then kind of did this little arc. And then there was a cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=5996)|
| 1:40:02| that came off of it and did this. This portion here, Road C, did not exist. So all these houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6002)|
| 1:40:09| here are all new. You bring up the 2019 plan, yeah. And this isn't in any form of FEMA map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6009)|
| 1:40:20| floodway, anything like that? No, no. There's just a standard buffer on it. So there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6020)|
| 1:40:28| floodway designations. Okay. And when do we find out what the improvements are to the common areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6028)|
| 1:40:40| Well, they don't have a plan or any common area that's provided that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6040)|
| 1:40:48| like a usable common area. So the common area in a stormwater facility is just a stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6048)|
| 1:40:53| facility. I guess if they had some extra space there, then somebody like the homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6053)|
| 1:41:00| association or developer of the site, whoever builds up the homes could potentially do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| maybe. But really, if they did do some kind of like structured common area, like some kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6064)|
| 1:41:10| structured building of some sort, they'd really have to bring it back to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| if it was just like an open field that kids could play on. And that's a little bit different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6074)|
| 1:41:22| But there's really nothing in this plan that is intended to be a usable open space. Everything's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6082)|
| 1:41:29| stormwater facility at this point. But aren't they, if you have 150 lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6089)|
| 1:41:38| maybe they don't have that many. You're required to have a common area? Well, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6098)|
| 1:41:46| there's nothing that is a written rule on that. So it's more of a, it's a policy that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6106)|
| 1:41:54| use. I mean, if you include the existing houses in the subdivision, they're probably going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6114)|
| 1:41:59| I can't remember if their count includes the existing ones. I don't think they do. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6119)|
| 1:42:08| once they build out this next section, it's definitely going to get over the threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| where we definitely want to see some type of structured common amenity. But like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6133)|
| 1:42:22| in the past, you know, when sidewalks aren't required and they are being proposed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6142)|
| 1:42:28| installed, that's, we sometimes look at that as a potential amenity feature for the subdivision as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6148)|
| 1:42:34| well. And the common area stormwater facility, that's basically where the retention pond goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6154)|
| 1:42:42| right? Correct. So we don't know how big that pond is compared to the remainder that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6162)|
| 1:42:51| might be able to use. Well, my guess is that that's not intended to be anything other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6171)|
| 1:42:56| stormwater. Okay. If they're not showing some other type of use there, it's going to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6176)|
| 1:43:02| stormwater facility. All right. So it's common area only because it, not that it's open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6182)|
| 1:43:09| or usable, but it's just a common stormwater retention pond. That's correct. Okay. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6189)|
| 1:43:14| ask for both of them? Yes. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6194)|
| 1:43:23| Other questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| I want to just quickly mention, I saw that there was a discussion, I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6208)|
| 1:43:34| I'm potentially trying to connect into the property to the north, which is labeled as Mary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6214)|
| 1:43:43| Lay Lane. I've kind of looked at that, those flats out here, and yeah, this is shown as Mary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6223)|
| 1:43:52| Lay Lane, but according to the flats, it looks like it might be a joint permanent easement. Maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6232)|
| 1:43:57| it's not really a right-of-way. And you can kind of see where there's this property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| If I click on it, this is actually, somebody owns it. So I don't think, this isn't really a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| So if somebody wanted to extend a road back into here and make a connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6247)|
| 1:44:13| it's probably going to be complicated. I don't know how feasible that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6253)|
| 1:44:19| So anyway, I just wanted to mention that. Would it, would it be possible to stub out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| the upper left cul-de-sac? Because it looks like the property, neighboring property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6264)|
| 1:44:31| to Ruggles Road, might be developed in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6271)|
| 1:44:38| So that cul-de-sac is about right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6278)|
| 1:44:44| Oh, that's the stormwater detention pond. Yeah, stormwater detention is right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6284)|
| 1:44:49| There might be some possibility where, when this neighboring property gets developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6289)|
| 1:44:56| you know, here, that there, you know, potentially could be some kind of connection up. But with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| green kind of way it meanders through there, it's probably difficult. Yeah. Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6301)|
| 1:45:10| Any other agenda items or questions before we turn it over to Beth for the nominating committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6310)|
| 1:45:18| Okay. Beth, it's all yours. I just wanted to remind the commissioners that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6318)|
| 1:45:24| we will be electing a chair and a vice chair to serve for the next five months that remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6324)|
| 1:45:31| of this year. And the nominating committee consisted of Commissioner Graf, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| Smith, and myself. We'll present the slate on Thursday. We'll also see if there are any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6336)|
| 1:45:43| additional nominations from the commissioners. So you can additionally add to the slate or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6343)|
| 1:45:50| nominate yourself, and then we'll vote on each. That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6350)|
| 1:45:56| Hey, Beth. Huh? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| Is today the time we should nominate someone else? Or is that, would that be Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6358)|
| 1:46:04| That'll happen Thursday. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6364)|
| 1:46:09| Any other questions or comments? I have one, but not related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6369)|
| 1:46:15| the nomination. Something separate. Okay. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| Okay. I just wanted to alert the commission that in my due diligence of getting prepared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6379)|
| 1:46:29| I accidentally had contact with one of the applicants for an item that wasn't on today's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6389)|
| 1:46:36| agenda, but is on the full agenda. It's item number 14. I don't think there's any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6396)|
| 1:46:47| a issue with that, but I did want to make the commission aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6407)|
| 1:46:54| Okay. Thank you. Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6414)|
| 1:46:59| Carol, I'd like to make a comment on our rezonings. We had nine on the agenda this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6419)|
| 1:47:08| and six of them take a sector plan amendment to do nine rezonings. That tells me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6428)|
| 1:47:19| either our plans are way out of date, or something's not right. We should only have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6439)|
| 1:47:28| three out of nine that don't take a sector plan amendment to approve it, or turn it down either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6448)|
| 1:47:36| way. Many of our sector plans are getting old, and one of the top priority items for the coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6456)|
| 1:47:44| fiscal year is updating the sector plans with the city sector plans going first, because they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| older, and then the county sector plans. So, you're correct. I won't be, but staff will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6469)|
| 1:47:57| working to update all those sector plans. Carol, you will be available by phone for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6477)|
| 1:48:04| future meetings, right? Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6484)|
| 1:48:10| Okay. Thanks to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| For a price, right, Gerald? Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| For a price, you might be. For a price, yes. Price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6495)|
| 1:48:20| And it's beyond a beer at Clancy's after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| You are going to come to the post-meeting group get-together, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6504)|
| 1:48:29| I think so. Okay. My wife tells me I can't be subjecting myself to people who may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6509)|
| 1:48:41| sick, because I don't want to be sick on my first month of retirement. So, I'll tell her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6521)|
| 1:48:50| Any other questions or comments? I thank all of you for your service, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| again, my thanks to our two new commissioners, Karen and Eddie, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6534)|
| 1:49:00| your commitment to the community. Thanks, and have a good rest of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200707-agenda-review?start=6540)|
