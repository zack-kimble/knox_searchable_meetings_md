| 0:00:00| Thank you, my fellow commissioners for your kind attention. We had to pause there for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=0)|
| 0:00:17| a second while I called the law to find out where Sir Bradley might be. And the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=17)|
| 0:00:26| he is the most important person of the day. Let me say first that I called to order this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=26)|
| 0:00:34| the February 2017 work session of Knox County Commission. And since it is the sixth month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=34)|
| 0:00:44| of commission, if there are to be any roll call votes in these meetings, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=44)|
| 0:00:52| Andrews will be the first to cast a ballot. And I also ask him if he would lead us in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=52)|
| 0:00:57| the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=57)|
| 0:00:59| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=59)|
| 0:01:12| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=72)|
| 0:01:32| Okay, so we seem to have become strangely quiet. We are down to the next item of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=92)|
| 0:01:39| agenda, which is amendments to the agenda. We'll have a two-step process here. One is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=99)|
| 0:01:46| to get to adds, defers, and withdrawals. And then the second motion will be to set the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=106)|
| 0:01:53| consent agenda. And amendments to the agenda, since the agenda committee met February the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=113)|
| 0:02:00| 8th, those items are before us. Items that have been added, which are in print, item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=120)|
| 0:02:13| 9, page 2, resolution 112 is an add for the appointments at Three Ridges Golf Board. Number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=133)|
| 0:02:23| 53 on page 14, resolution 606, funding of use of prevention of tobacco products is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=143)|
| 0:02:33| add. And also item number 64, page 16, is a presentation by the Clerk of Courts, Clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=153)|
| 0:02:44| Hammond. Are there other items to be added? Are there other items to be added? Then we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=164)|
| 0:02:54| move to the deferrals. Item number 12, page 3, resolution 203, it's an agreement between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=174)|
| 0:03:06| KUB and Knox County on Carter High School, a right-of-way that will be deferred to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=186)|
| 0:03:15| next meeting. Are there any withdrawals? Are there any withdrawals? Commissioner Geale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=195)|
| 0:03:31| Item on page 4, number 14, R17-205. Right now dealing with adds, deferrals, or withdrawals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=211)|
| 0:03:46| only. Next motion we'll have will be to set the consent agenda. Seeing no other discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=226)|
| 0:03:53| for adds, deferrals, or withdrawals, I hear that those that need to be added, added, deferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=233)|
| 0:04:01| deferred, withdrawn, withdrawn. Motion is properly before us. All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=241)|
| 0:04:10| No. Motion carries. Now then the second step of setting consent. Let me say this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=250)|
| 0:04:21| Item number 7, page 2, resolution 110, add a name to the Ag Committee, will not be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=261)|
| 0:04:36| Number 57, excuse me, number 54, page 15, number 54, page 15, resolution 701, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=276)|
| 0:04:51| Busler and I need to have a small discussion just to make sure that everyone understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| the difference between a swing and a bench and a swinging bench. Also item number 60,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=297)|
| 0:05:11| page 16, closure of a portion of Loveless Road will be discussed. Are there other items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=311)|
| 0:05:23| that need not be on consent that we should discuss today in the work session? Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| Gill. Items 14 and 15. Are there other items of discussion? Items 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=328)|
| 0:05:59| And 58. Are there other items of the agenda that need discussion? The items that are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=359)|
| 0:06:15| on consent are 7, 54, 60, 14, 15, 46, and 58. All others will be on consent. Seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=375)|
| 0:06:34| no further discussion, is there a motion that the consent agenda be set? So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=394)|
| 0:06:54| Motion is properly before us that the consent agenda be set. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| Opposed, no. The motion carries. Those items that we will discuss, Madam, excuse me, let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=420)|
| 0:07:11| us have a pause for just a second. If there be no objection, is the Honorable Mayor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=431)|
| 0:07:21| Knox County with us today? Mr. Grider? Okay, I'll come back to him in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=441)|
| 0:07:30| Representative of the Board of Education, but usually the Chair of the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=450)|
| 0:07:37| Ms. Bounds, is with us. Is Ms. Bounds here this evening? I would like to comment on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=457)|
| 0:07:46| progress that is being made by the Board of Education in the superintendent's search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| They set out a plan several weeks ago and they are currently on schedule. They have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| names before them. They are up to the schedule on performing their search for the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=479)|
| 0:08:08| and I applaud them in their effort. One other thing, if there be no objection, let me move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=488)|
| 0:08:18| to the end of the agenda. Criminal Court Clerk, Mr. Mike Hammond, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=498)|
| 0:08:32| This is item 64. Mr. Hammond? Thank you, Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| It's always nice to come on behalf of our employees and give you money. As you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| each quarter we come and provide you with what we call the efficiency dividend. Some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| would say excess fees. And so on behalf of our employees, we'd like to present you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| with a check for $250,000. We'd also like to let you know that over the last two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| with this amount, we have now turned over to Knox County over $2 million. So I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| want to say a great job done by all of our employees. I know that you'll spend the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| wisely. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Hammond. I will now return to one of my earlier statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=547)|
| 0:09:15| Mr. Mayor Burchett, the Honorable Mayor of Knox County, would you? I recognize you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=555)|
| 0:09:22| the moment of saying, do you have anything to say? And he said no. Yes, that's what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=562)|
| 0:09:31| going to do. Now we're going to back up one item number 63. This is in regard to beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=571)|
| 0:09:40| board and licensing. And I'd like to recognize Captain Allen May, Knox County Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=580)|
| 0:09:48| Department, for the purpose of giving us a moment of something that we've I think we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=588)|
| 0:10:00| only had one beer sting in the last couple of three months. And I know the reasoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=600)|
| 0:10:08| behind it. We've had trouble finding people that could go out and help us do that. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| for the purpose of the issue that's before us, you have the floor for speaking of licensing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=613)|
| 0:10:20| and stings. Okay. We have approximately 160 businesses in Knox County that sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=620)|
| 0:10:31| Last year, we checked about 150 of them, wrote 31 citations. And one of the things, I passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=631)|
| 0:10:41| out some driver's licenses of underage people. And all drivers under the age of 21 will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=641)|
| 0:10:49| a red stripe telling when they turn 21 and have it beside their picture. It doesn't matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=649)|
| 0:10:57| if they've got an intermediate license or a regular license. It'll always tell when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=657)|
| 0:11:04| they turn 21. When we sign a business, the clerk or server comes to Sessions Court and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=664)|
| 0:11:14| the business comes in front of the Knox County Beer Board. All underage people, we take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=674)|
| 0:11:22| picture before and after, even if we're only doing an eight-hour day, and a picture of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=682)|
| 0:11:28| driver's license so that no one can say, well, we couldn't see when their birthday was. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=688)|
| 0:11:36| all they have to do is the red stripe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| When we conduct a sting, we did one a couple weeks ago, and we'll be coming back next Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=700)|
| 0:11:55| with an underage beer sale. The main thing is we don't try to trick any of the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=715)|
| 0:12:04| The people we use, they use their real license. They basically have them in their hand to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=724)|
| 0:12:12| offer if they're asked. Most of the people that we cite do not look at the driver's license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| do not even take it from the underage person to see if they're 21. So most of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=738)|
| 0:12:28| they're not checking IDs, but we checked 24, week four last, and only cited one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=748)|
| 0:12:37| So I think we're getting the word around that you all are serious about underage drinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=757)|
| 0:12:44| and we'll vamp up here for the prom and graduation and get ready to go and check some more places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=764)|
| 0:12:56| We've got some more underage people finally, and no one wants to do it because they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=776)|
| 0:13:04| afraid some of their friends will be in the place, and they'll try to get them. But if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=784)|
| 0:13:11| you have any questions, I guess I'll give you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=791)|
| 0:13:18| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| No, just a second. We've got a question. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| I just wanted to thank Wolfie and the Sheriff's Department for doing this, and I'm glad we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| are making some progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| Thank you, Captain Mays, for bringing the presentations. The thing that has always amazed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| me is that people could come here and stand before us and say, well, I didn't know they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| were underage, or I missed it when I calculated the date, when there's a red band there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| says it's a no-go from the beginning. So, again, thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=833)|
| 0:14:01| Seeing nothing else to come before us right at the moment, then, Madam Clerk, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| begin with the item number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, appointing Laura| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| Nolan and Lynn Jessie and reappointing Commissioner to the Agricultural Extension Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=853)|
| 0:14:20| Resolution 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| There are names there. The Commissioner name is the one that we need to fill in the blank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=863)|
| 0:14:32| on, and for some background, I'm going to recognize Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When I was first appointed to the County Commission, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| were no committees available, so the Agricultural Committee was the only one out there, so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=882)|
| 0:14:51| was volunteered to serve, but seeing that there's actually more agricultural area in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| the south side of Knox County, I'd like to nominate Carson Daly to serve on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=897)|
| 0:15:08| Commissioner Daly, would you serve on that committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| I would be honored to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| I'd just like to point out to Commissioner Schoonmaker, whenever I was at Bearden High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| School, you all were referred to as the Farragut Farmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| In case you didn't catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| And how many years ago was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| They were known at Central also, and I had a sister-in-law that graduated from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| so I can say that is family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| All in favor of Carson Daly being a member of the Ag Extension Committee say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=939)|
| 0:15:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| Motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| Chairman, if I might ask, what exactly does that committee do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| Frankly, I'm quite curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| My wife works in agriculture at the University of Tennessee, and I'm just honestly curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| what that committee does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| Well, not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=968)|
| 0:16:18| We haven't had an issue to deal with since I was appointed to that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=978)|
| 0:16:25| Neil Denton, the chairman of that committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| Yeah, Mr. Denton is the chairman of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| Probably need to get Mr. Denton to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| Commissioner Anders, did you make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| Motion to approve adding Carson Daly onto the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| Motion is properly before us to add Carson Daly as the name in this resolution to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| on the Agricultural Extension Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| Number 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1016)|

| 0:17:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| I wanted to know what Capstone Innovative Diploma involves and how it prepares students for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| assessing college and just some general information about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1047)|

| 0:17:34| Shannon Jackson, Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1054)|

| 0:17:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| So the AP Capstone is a relatively new program coming out of College Board which allows our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| students to engage in inquiry-based research and put together a systematic project on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1067)|
| 0:17:54| that is of their area of interest, and they do a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| It's two courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| One is research and one is the seminar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| And it is to give them that experience of individualized research using university-level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1088)|

| 0:18:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| Do I hear a motion it be approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1097)|

| 0:18:31| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| We will read the next one, but I believe it's the same answer to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1118)|

| 0:18:44| Item number 15 is approving a program agreement with the College Board for provision of an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1124)|

| 0:18:55| High School, Resolution 206.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| I guess my question, Russ, is this a program or a principal preference, and this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| only two schools that asked for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| That was my second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| And how are students selected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| So students can opt into this course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| So it's like any other AP course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| They can sign up to take the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| This is one course where the individual schools do have to apply and go through an approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| process, so we have to have a separate LOA for each school that has gone through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| And these are the only two schools, Bearden and Farragut, that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| We have a couple of additional schools that should be on the next agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| The timeline has closed for this school year, so we're now working on the 18-19 after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| So our goal is to get everybody there within the next two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1190)|

| 0:22:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1334)|
| 0:22:24| I understood that there's a little misconception between the description of what was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| on out there, but I think that you all have already discussed between the people out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| that were wanting this built, and you have come to an understanding of what is to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| built out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1362)|

| 0:22:47| Yeah, I think we just left off the worst swing in this, not realizing there are some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| legal documents from the donors attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| So what is before us is not a swing, and it's not a bench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| It's a bench swing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| It's a swinging bench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Or a swinging bench, as requested by the bequeath that was given through to Knox County to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1386)|
| 0:23:19| Commissioner Bussler, I have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1399)|

| 0:23:30| I don't have a question about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1410)|

| 0:23:40| to have known Jeannie Sharp, as we all called her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1420)|
| 0:23:46| What I guess I'm asking our law director, since I am a member of the Halls Women's League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| and this is strictly money, the $15,000 is being given by the Halls Women's League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1432)|
| 0:24:00| just to make sure that everybody realizes that it's coming from the Halls Women's League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| from all of our fundraisers that we have throughout the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| So I'm asking you, do I vote or not, since I'm an official active member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1450)|
| 0:24:17| Well, you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| You have no financial benefits, so there's no conflict in terms of ethics in the hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1458)|
| 0:24:26| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1466)|

| 0:25:30| Consideration of the closure of a portion of the Lovelace Road and the closure and effect of the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| approximately 1,300 feet of Lovelace Road where it terminates into Mountain Hill A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1534)|
| 0:25:42| I make a motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| I'm sorry, I didn't hear the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| What was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Without recommendation so we could discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| We have a motion before us to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| I'm just repeating the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| Mr. Van de Veet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1559)|
| 0:26:07| At an earlier meeting, we had presented to us, Commission, a request to close 1,300 feet of Lovelace Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1567)|
| 0:26:21| There was a lengthy, significant discussion at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| The request for closure was brought by Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| Are you still submitting that request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| We submitted on behalf of the constituents who made the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| We don't stipulate a position on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| To our knowledge, there is no transportation reason to advocate for the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| As you'll recall, Mr. Chairman, the residents who petitioned for the closure cited a number of public order issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1605)|
| 0:26:52| We provided the police reports and 911 call history to Commission for the area for your deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1612)|
| 0:27:01| Since that time, Mr. Snowden has met both the parties who are supportive of the closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1621)|
| 0:27:08| and the parties who are opposed to the closure on site with representatives from the Tennessee Valley Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| and facilitated that discussion, but that's all we can or should do at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| To my knowledge, I don't know that those conversations have been particularly productive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| so I'm not sure we're in a different place than we started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| Okay, so my basic simple question was there is still support from constituents supporting closure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1649)|
| 0:27:38| Yes, sir, there is both support and opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| Okay, so the request is still before us. Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| Yes, sir, Dwight, whenever we talked to TVA, didn't they lay claim to half the roadway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| Yes, sir, they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| They called to the center line of the road and indicated they would object to the installation of a gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| Did our law department, I guess, was that, I mean, just because I say it doesn't make it true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| did we go through and verify the deeds and all that stuff on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| How do we stand with that, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| I understand that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| I think I probably should defer to Jim, who's done more of the title work on this than I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| but I don't have any reason typically to dispute TVA's claim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| and normally when they assert something, it's going to be pretty well buttoned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1698)|
| 0:28:32| And that's Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| Before you get in, what's your title again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| Chief Engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| The documentation that TVA provided does have a legal description that calls to the center of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| so we have checked that, and that is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| I think the constituents that are for the closure were going to discuss the possibility with TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| to allow them to close that half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| TVA said that that had been done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| I don't know how those conversations went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| but TVA was at least open to that idea based on additional conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| But the county wouldn't be wise to close half the road until TVA makes a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| I mean, we're going to run into a bunch of legal ramifications if we try to do something with that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| I asked the proponents of the closure about that because I thought that might change their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1765)|
| 0:29:33| They would still like to pursue the closure regardless of TVA claiming half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| and then they would close it on our portion and continue those conversations with TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| It was what they had specified at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| One issue I found, I actually went out there on site, took pictures, and did a walk around at the end of that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| I mean, frankly, it's a very welcoming looking dead end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| While I know it's not a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| there's ample room at the end of that dead end for multiple cars to park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| and I can see how someone from outside the neighborhood would perceive that to be a welcoming area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| a place to stop, and a place to fish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| When I met with one of the residents, they're clear they had just found out at the time back in December that there was a TVA issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1817)|
| 0:30:24| Personally, I'd be uncomfortable in voting in favor of this if there's still a pending TVA issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| But I think one of the main issues that needs to be resolved on this is, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| trying to either reduce the amount of parking space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| or either create some sort of different type of turnaround situation at the back of that lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| because it really looks like a very sort of having a park bench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| It's a very welcoming area with plenty of room to park multiple cars back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| Dwight or Jim, when did Knox County pave that road last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1856)|
| 0:31:05| We have to, and I'm not even sure we could determine that looking at our records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| We'll be glad to make the effort, Commissioner, but I would assume it's been a period of some years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| certainly not on my watch and not in anybody's recent memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| What I was getting at is now that you're aware that TVA owns half the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| are you going to, in the future, have them pay for half of the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1886)|
| 0:31:33| If we have maintained it 100 percent all these years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| I'm not sure that I serve our interests by getting into any sort of argument with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| I don't know if this is Commissioner Nystrom's thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| We'd like to get a good outcome here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| In effect, this is functioning as an ad hoc park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| If it was going to continue to function as an ad hoc park, it might actually make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| I'm way outside my lane here, but certainly it's something we could help with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| to give it some of the amenities that make a park function well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| such as lighting, adequate parking, and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1925)|
| 0:32:12| Obviously, the parking is something that we could help with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| if agreement was arrived at for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| But in the meantime, we're sort of in the same position the Commission is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| with a request for the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1942)|
| 0:32:35| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| I live on Hardin Valley Road, and I've lived there for over 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| and the community uses that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| They use it to fish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| I've taken my grandchildren down there to fish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| and I don't think it would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| You know, when we've had these meetings in West Knox County with the people who live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| one of the things they want are parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| They've mentioned it over and over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| There are not any parks in that area of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| This would be a great way to answer that question and develop this in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| So I'll be voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| The concern for the proponents to close the road was a safety concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| I had Captain Hubbs pull the records from July of 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| There were only four calls, three by one neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| and one of those was to call and cancel the call because the people had left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| So I didn't see a safety concern then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| I've got the crime map pulled up now since October 1st through 2-21 today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2017)|
| 0:33:43| There's been no calls to the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| So it's not a safety factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| I think it's more of a convenience factor for these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| So I'm a Mr. Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| I'll be voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| I sit on the Legacy Board Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| and one of the main issues we have here is to make sure that we've got access to waterways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| and that's one of what Legacy Boards does, and parks for people to use close to the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2048)|
| 0:34:16| And this is a great way of taking care of the issues that Legacy Park is dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2056)|
| 0:34:25| if we could some way find a way to make it into a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| So anyway, we need to take a look at that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| I'm just going to say Commissioner Daley and Commissioner Brantley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| having to love the water and the sun like I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| and love our lakes around here and going to the lakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2088)|
| 0:34:55| My in-laws have a place on Norris, and we deal with this same thing because they live on a dead end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| but TVA has a road that anybody around can come in and go out onto the point and camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2101)|
| 0:35:10| And we deal with this, and, you know, it's the joy and the beauty of our beautiful lakes and where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2110)|
| 0:35:18| So to deny anybody to be able to come by boat or to go, you know, down this road and park their car is not what we're here to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2118)|
| 0:35:32| And I saw the records and the calls to the sheriff's office, and I'm like, there wasn't anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2132)|
| 0:35:40| And one thing I think the neighbors need, you don't need to approach anybody if you think something's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| That's why we have our law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| You call emergency 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| Don't try to deal with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| So I will be voting no after finding out the information from last time we discussed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| with knowing that TVA did have claims to the center of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| I by no means want to get into any discussion or any possible lawsuits with TVA and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2164)|
| 0:36:12| So just to make my point that I will be voting no, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| For the record, I have been there three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| I've been there morning one week, midday one week, and evening one week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| And I've not seen litter the first time out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| And actually I didn't see any cars, and that was back in October, November, December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| But I will make another trip out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| But I just wanted that for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| I have been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| Before we move any further, I think there may be some residents out there on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| If there are and they want to speak, I want to give them an opportunity if they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| I didn't want to ignore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| I thought you were out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| I didn't want to ignore you, so if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2213)|
| 0:37:02| Jim Krieger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| I'm Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| And you will be speaking in opposition to the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| I am at 2707 Pine Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| She spoke for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| She said that there's plenty of room to go down there and turn around and park and leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| And one thing they were saying on the November meeting was how narrow and crowded and you couldn't park there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| So I brought a couple of pictures, but I don't need to show them since you all have already been down there and seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| But I appreciate Ed Brantley and his speaking up for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| Thank you, Mr. Krieger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| A couple of my neighbors are here also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| I don't know if they want to speak or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| If anyone else would like to speak for or against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2263)|
| 0:37:50| Sir, your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| My name is Bob Orell, O-R-R-E-L-L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| And I've lived in the Shoreline Estates at 2613 Shoreline Drive for like 28 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2278)|
| 0:38:08| And the first time I ever went to Melton Hill Lake was with H.E. Biddle, and that's where we launched our boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| And that's the reason I fell in love with that area and wound up buying property and building a home there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2295)|
| 0:38:24| Currently, if we have to take a boat out for repairs or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2304)|
| 0:38:31| the closest other place is the dam, which is like a 20-mile round trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2311)|
| 0:38:38| That area could very easily be converted into a decent launch ramp and limit parking if you needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2318)|
| 0:38:51| But the neighbors there, we can take our trailer down there or put our boat in and take our vehicle home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2331)|
| 0:38:59| We don't have to necessarily park down there all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| But it's a very convenient place for the people that live in our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| And I don't see taking that away from the community to satisfy the desires of two or three households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2349)|
| 0:39:18| And so I would urge you to let's improve it some and make it a good place for everybody to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2358)|
| 0:39:28| It's public property and it should be kept open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| Thank you, Mr. Orell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| Is there any other conversation for or against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2374)|
| 0:39:41| Your name and address for the record, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| My name is Tommy Phelps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| My address is 2708 Pine Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| I'm also against the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| I'm aware of not only Jim Krieger's family using that as a put-in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| but two other local people that don't have lake access use that as a put-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| One is the Keller Farm, which is charcoal hollow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| They have used it as a put-in for their watercraft as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| I agree with the folks saying it would be nice to address and make it a little more amenable as a put-in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2407)|
| 0:40:14| whether or not lighting is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| But certainly if there's an issue, cameras could certainly be placed in that area and monitored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2416)|
| 0:40:24| Police officers or sheriff's department people could cruise around there once in a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| but it is a very good place to put in, and it is used by many people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| And with that, I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| Thank you, Mr. Phelps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| And one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| Sir, your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| Gary Boyd at 2616 Shoreline Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| I'm also against the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| In addition to the things that have been stated, we use that regularly for exercise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| since it's the only flat road within probably five miles and use it almost daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2454)|
| 0:41:01| And I would just add that if the concern was safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| you're going to create 1,300 feet up the road another parking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| So I don't quite understand the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| If it's not access to the lake, you're just backing up the issue of potential somebody using that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2472)|
| 0:41:19| for something other than enjoying the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2482)|
| 0:41:29| Yes, sir, your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| My name is Alan Witt, 13204 Lovelace Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| And I have some pictures I'd like to get them on the screen as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2496)|
| 0:41:57| I represent the neighbors that are for the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| And so tonight I would like to address some of the questions and concerns that were raised in the November meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| and even some of these concerns that were raised tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| The neighbors at the end of the road, we don't want to limit access for our neighbors or anyone in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2529)|
| 0:42:17| That's not our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| We're trying to limit vehicle access on this portion of the road simply because the road is not a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2538)|
| 0:42:27| It's a driveway concerning its width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| And so as more people come, it's becoming more and more of an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| So let's take away, even if we take away the criminal activity that goes on down there, which there is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2559)|
| 0:42:45| but you take that away just from a traffic standpoint, it's just not adequate to handle what is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2565)|
| 0:42:52| So if you look at this map, number two, the blue shaded, that's TVA property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| On the other side of the cove, they have 50 acres that could be developed into a wonderful park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| and they have it set aside for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| It's the last place on Milton Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| That is set aside by TVA for recreation development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| And they're waiting for the county to come and say, let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| When we met with TVA at the end of the road, they were asking Jim, do you all want to park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| Do you want to develop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| They have it set aside for a marina slash campground slash parks, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2600)|
| 0:43:28| So there's 50 acres over there ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| Where our line would be, we would not block access to that 50 acres or the strip of TVA land that is on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2612)|
| 0:43:44| We're not trying to block access to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| We're trying to block access to cars coming all the way down the road in which it's not adequate to handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| And as far as why do we feel that it's better to stop them there and have them park and do their illegal activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2633)|
| 0:44:02| as to come all the way down to the end of the road and do their illegal activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| is because lot number seven there on that map, that house sits right on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| They're doing this stuff in their front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| So if the legal activities continue, and we'll agree that some of it will, if we push it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2654)|
| 0:44:22| these other properties, the houses are much further off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| You can't even see the road from these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| So while, yes, some of this may continue, it will get it out of these last two homes, front and backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2669)|
| 0:44:37| which it is currently going on in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2677)|
| 0:44:44| So like I said, we're only, the closure we're proposing would not limit pedestrian foot traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2684)|
| 0:44:51| With TVA owning half of the road, which we did have a survey done to confirm their wording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2691)|
| 0:45:00| it is not a strict middle of the road, half of the road ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| There is a wide spot here or there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| The wide spots are in our favor and the county's favor currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| We do believe that we have enough to block the road for vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| If this closure went through, we believe that there's enough that we could block vehicle traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| Obviously, it would still be open to pedestrian foot traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| We're only talking 1,300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| We're not asking them to walk a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| And we think that limiting the vehicle traffic at that point would make our neighborhood extremely more safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2730)|
| 0:45:44| And everybody would still have access to do everything that they're currently doing on TVA property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| fishing, hunting, canoeing, whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| The only thing it would stop is launching a boat there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| It's not an approved TVA boat ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| And there is two other TVA boat ramps within six miles of this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2761)|
| 0:46:08| The maps that I gave all the commissioners today, Hickory Creek Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| most of these people that are standing in opposition of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| they're going less than two miles extra to go to Hickory Creek Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| We're asking them to go less than two miles extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| If we could get the next picture, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| So this is the end, as you come down to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| And so I'm willing to agree that somebody could come down there with a truck and a trailer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2790)|
| 0:46:36| launch their boat, and park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| And for argument's sake, I'll agree another truck can come down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| and somehow get turned around, not getting in anybody else's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| launch their boat, and park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| But after that, it's a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| And when the third boat comes down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| I would like to know what everybody's proposing, how they're going to get out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| Are they going to back a half a mile up the road to turn around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| Because that's the next public place to turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| That's the next subdivision to turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| And even if we're not talking boat traffic, truck and trailers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| let's just say that we have five people that want to come down there and fish and swim on a particular day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| And in the summertime, that's not uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| Right now, the reason you're not seeing any trash or any issues down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| it's the middle of winter, and I'll grant you that all that really happens right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| is people drive up and down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| They go down there, they turn around, and they drive back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| But in the summertime, it's a different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| And so if we have, let's say we have five cars parked down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| what's the sixth one going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| How are they going to turn around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| Are they going to back up the road a half a mile to turn around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| Next picture, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| This is a picture of my truck sitting on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| This is not the narrowest part of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| This is up by my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| This is one of the wider sections of this part of the road that we're talking about closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| The further you go down, the narrower it gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| And I don't understand how somebody can sit here and say, oh, it doesn't cause any issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| You can pass two trucks pulling boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| You can pass on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| There's no way in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| Next picture, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| So here I've provided maps in these next two slides of everyone that was in opposition from the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2899)|
| 0:48:30| The first point is the end of Lovelace Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| This particular slide shows Shoreline Estates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| The other is Hickory Creek Park and the distance that they would have to go to go to Hickory Creek Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| Hickory Creek Park is not the only park that has a boat ramp in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| There's also Milton Hill Park, which is a huge facility with two boat ramps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| and radio-controlled launching and bicycle paths and all kinds of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2933)|
| 0:49:00| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| And this is the rest of the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| And as you can see, once you get onto Hickory Creek Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| you are now just as close to Hickory Creek Park as you are to the end of Lovelace Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| These people, we're asking them to go no further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| We're just asking them to go to the place that the county and TVA have provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| This is a picture of Hickory Creek Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| As you can see, it's a great facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| It has trash cans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| It has a pavilion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| It has plenty of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| It has a turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| This is an overhead shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| So you come in off the road, and you loop in, and you pull up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| and you come back straight in the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| You can park your trailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| Nobody's ever going to get blocked in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| Nobody's ever going to have to back a half mile up the road here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| This is Milton Hill Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| As you can see, there's a boat launch on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| The one has a dock to park and tie your boat up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| This facility is further away than Hickory Creek Park for people in my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| but it's less than six miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| And while we're not trying to inconvenience our neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3013)|
| 0:50:20| they're getting the best part of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| They're coming down, launching their boat, having a great time, and that's all wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| But we live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| We're dealing with the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| We're dealing with the trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| We're dealing with having a hard time getting in and out of our driveways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| because somebody's got a 20-foot boat that they're trying to get down to the end of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| that's not adequate to handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| Still Milton Hill Park and the facilities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| The second boat launch that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| As you can see, that particular park is an outstanding park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3067)|
| 0:51:15| The main opposition to this road closure is not fishing or canoeing or using the TVA land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3075)|
| 0:51:24| The opposition is a boat launch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| This is not a TVA boat launch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| You go on TVA's website, Hickory Creek is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3089)|
| 0:51:34| Milton Hill Park is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| The dam is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| These are the places that TVA is directing the public to go to launch a boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| The end of Lovelace Road is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| And if you speak with TVA, they'll tell you, yes, we know people are using it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3105)|
| 0:51:51| but they're not going to tell anybody, hey, you can launch your boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| They don't advertise it on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| They do not recognize it as a boat launch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| And the simple fact or the reason is is because the day they did, there would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3119)|
| 0:52:07| we would have the police down there, that's for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| because we'd have about ten people trying to back a truck up the road at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| So while currently I agree with my neighbors, they're coming down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3134)|
| 0:52:21| and they're launching their boat, and there's no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| But last year on our busy days, Labor Day weekend, Fourth of July, we had some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3145)|
| 0:52:33| Was it to the point that law enforcement had to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| No, but it's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| Hardin Valley is exploding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| This problem is not, you know, we're not going to have less people coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| We're going to have more people coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| And there's just not room for it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| Instead of trying to, I don't understand why we would even attempt to make room for it here on this side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| when we have 50 acres across the cove that TVA is more than willing to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| and we have two other parks in the area that are already developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| All we're asking is use the parks that the county and TVA have provided in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3182)|
| 0:53:12| Less than six miles away, both of them, Hickory Creek Park, much closer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| The county and TVA have provided wonderful facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| We just ask that the public use that instead of a dead-end road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| Thank you, Mr. Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| Commissioner Carringer, did you wish to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3206)|
| 0:53:36| We have had enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| I think we've had sufficient for us and against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| And I just wanted to make a comment because, I mean, how often has there been the four and five trucks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3222)|
| 0:53:51| And, I mean, has this really been an issue that people are backing up the road with trailers and all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| And to say Fourth of July or Labor Day, every single lake is packed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3236)|
| 0:54:01| And the fireworks up at Sequoia Boat Dock, I mean, you know when to get out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3241)|
| 0:54:10| when not to get out or to go or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| But that's not at someone's residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| No, we deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| We deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| I think this is kind of where we're confusing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| You know, if I was at. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| Just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| But I'm just saying. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| No, just a moment, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| We're getting into the discussion when we need to be moving on, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3266)|
| 0:54:33| Well, I'm just trying to clarify and understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| I would love to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| But when we don't really have the right of way. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| And I live on a cul-de-sac and cars kind of turn all around, but I can't do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| So it's. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| This situation is a little bit odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| And that's the reason we're here asking for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| This road wasn't in this condition when the county originally built it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| It's when TVA flooded the lake that we ended up with this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| And it wasn't addressed at that time because there was one house sitting out there and a bunch of farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| And it wasn't an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| But it's an issue today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| It's a different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| And so that's kind of how we ended up here today instead of 30 or 40 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| You know, 40 years ago, this is not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| Today, it is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| And currently, it is the major holidays that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3328)|
| 0:55:35| I think everybody would agree it's only going to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| And we've seen that over the time that I've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| I've only lived there a very short time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| There's just more and more people coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| And it's just not room for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| But there's nowhere for them to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| So if they can't park, then they have to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| I mean there's only so many that can get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| The road is only so wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| That's really the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| The road is only so wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| My driveway is as wide as this road in this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| Mr. Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| You've had sufficient time to express your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| And I will recognize you, sir, in the blue shirt, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| Your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| I'm Ken Hargett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| I'm the one that lives there at where all of this is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| You guys heard the horror stories?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| Sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| You guys heard the horror stories of what went on in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| And I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| Was it Brad that said the police report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| I can't wait to see Mr. Brantley down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| I'll welcome him any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| Like I said, I fed, I think it was 130-something down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| did a good fish fry, the entire neighborhood mostly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| But let me give you some real meat and potatoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| I went down and met with Dave Harrell, who's over the lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3423)|
| 0:57:10| and trying to come up with a solution for these guys and us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3430)|
| 0:57:17| What Alan has presented is a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| I've made an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| I did not call the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| I did not call the police a month ago when it was going on down there again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| My error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| And it's my error, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| I actually keep it clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| I go down with my gator and keep it clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| Now, meat and potatoes, I am so sorry, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| Meat and potatoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| The biggest complaint of Hicker Creek Park was you can't put a boat in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| because it will drag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| It needs to be dredged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| So I went to Dave Harrell and gave him a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| They're building a new sewer treatment plant just beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| They're about to dredge that and put the pipe for the release of that water back into that cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3479)|
| 0:58:08| They're about to dredge that cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| And he was very excited to learn that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| So they were going to reach out and try to see what they could do in working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3494)|
| 0:58:20| That's also federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| So since they're going to have the equipment down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| they may make this park that everybody complains about work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| Second, as far as those trucks and stuff getting down there, Allen is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3511)|
| 0:58:38| Hugh has been down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| I met him down there and talked to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| And you put two 25-foot-long vehicles with trailers down there, it is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3521)|
| 0:58:49| And they used my driveway to turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| I don't have any plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| But another positive, TVA just approved my new boat dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3535)|
| 0:59:02| It went through the review cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| I'm going to be meeting and getting power put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| I'm going to be putting cameras down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| This was a suggestion from TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| I want to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| I will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| I will not have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| If my 10-year-old daughter is out there and the guy was doing what he was doing a month ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| I'm not going to wait for the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| I've already told them I'm not going to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| I'm going to run that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| I'm going to go down and tell them to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| I want to ask Mr. Brantley, would you let your 10-year-old granddaughter witness someone have ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3572)|
| 0:59:44| Sir, I honestly don't know what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| I've lived in Hardin Valley a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| I know you have, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| And we're all experiencing the same growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| I don't care whether you live on the lake or you live up next to Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| This morning, cars were back on Pellissippi Parkway for four miles trying to get off on Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| Listen, it's everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| And this is just ‑‑ you guys down at the end of Lovelace Road are just experiencing a little bit of what everybody else is experiencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3606)|
| 1:00:14| You live where everybody else wants to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| Everybody else wants to enjoy that lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| Now, a lot of people who've had years of going down there on their own with their children and fishing and no problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3618)|
| 1:00:25| I understand your complaints about whatever you're talking about, the illegal activity that we don't have much of a record of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3625)|
| 1:00:32| But, you know, if a few guys want to put their boat in there, why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| We've never said anything to those guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| Well, what's the point then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| Well, the point is is what happens after 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| Well, here ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| There's a sign down there that says blatantly after night use prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3647)|
| 1:00:53| You've seen the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| Yes, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| I have seen the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| Do I have a right to ask them to leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| Well, I don't know that you do, but you certainly have a right to talk to the Sheriff's Department and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| But regardless, we're going to pass this until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| We're not voting on this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| Yes, sir, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| And Monday would be the time to discuss it in reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| And I encourage all the commissioners to go down and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Continuing, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| Now, don't go down after 7 o'clock because he might get you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| No, I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| If you turn around and wave or whatever, I'll turn around and go back in and fix dinner for my daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3686)|
| 1:01:32| Sir, your closing statement, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| That was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| Your name again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| Bob Orell, 2613 Shoreline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| This gentleman keeps talking about Hickory Creek Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| Have you been over there and looked at that today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| You couldn't put a kid's little sailboat in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| It's a mudflat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| And it's very shallow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| Even when the lake elevation is up, you've got the pole out of there just about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| It is so shallow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| But right now, it is a mudflat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| And we can bring a picture of it next Monday, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| The question is before us is a closure of this road, not the available facilities in another location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3734)|
| 1:02:21| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| I was going to change my motion, but we'll just keep it the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| I'd go ahead and like to go vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| The motion that is before us is to send forward to full commission no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3751)|
| 1:02:38| That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| Madam Clerk, do we have line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3769)|
| 1:02:56| Do I have a motion that they be sent no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| Madam Clerk, item 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3783)|
| 1:03:10| Spread of record, the criminal court clerk's employee handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3790)|
| 1:03:16| I think that closes all the items that we have on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| A couple of things that I would like to remind commission of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| that while roll call was being, excuse me, while the Pledge of Allegiance was being given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3805)|
| 1:03:32| the clerk performed a silent roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| All commissioners present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| Also, I'd like to remind commission that tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| Dr. Anthony Wise, the president of Pellissippi State,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| is expecting us to be at the Pellissippi campus at Straw Plains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| for the purpose of a tour of the educational facility, Pellissippi State at Straw Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3834)|
| 1:04:01| That's tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170221?start=3841)|
