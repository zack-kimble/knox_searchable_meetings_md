| 0:01:08| A handout has just been given resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=68)|
| 0:01:14| It'll be resolution 112.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=74)|
| 0:01:16| It's a recommendation from the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=76)|
| 0:01:19| on an appointment of a member to the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=79)|
| 0:01:28| Any other amendments to the agenda, Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=88)|
| 0:01:33| Also, I'd like to add a discussion item for items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| coming out of the Audit Committee actions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| took place today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=100)|
| 0:01:42| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=102)|
| 0:01:44| That was what I was going to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| Is there any, you guys were sending an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| that we're pulling essentially the whole agenda to consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| Basically, the agenda is contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| granted through the budget and awarded through the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| So minus number eight, is there any other anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| you'd like to modify on the consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=122)|
| 0:02:04| Yeah, I'd like to pull number, well, the one I printed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| It's 210 and 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| It's number 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| 18 and 41 on my sheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| This is a question for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| Number 18 on page 5, 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=140)|
| 0:02:29| Number 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| It's on page 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| So we have 18 and 41?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=158)|

| 0:02:43| The motion needs to be to add what needs to be added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| delete what needs to be deleted, and pull from consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| what needs to be pulled from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=173)|

| 0:03:03| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| Move to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=185)|

| 0:03:09| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=189)|

| 0:03:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| If you guys don't mind with the light agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| if you don't mind the city, mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| is here on a discussion item in regards to tax increment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| financing number 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| Without objection, I'd like to move that up to the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| if you all don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| With no objection, we'll go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| Madam clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| That's the presentation by the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| office of redevelopment regarding their development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| assistance program and tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| Mr. Wetzel, or Dr. Lyons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| Just need your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| Bill Lyons of 607 Union, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| Thank you, Chairman Andrews and everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| on county commission for being here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| and being patient with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| What I hope will be a very concise bulleted presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| to allow for plenty of Q&A so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| get into a nice discussion if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| the desire of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| What we wanted to do and realize that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| been using a tool, a tax increment financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| for development that's gone back through meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| with many commissioners and commissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| but we haven't taken anything to you folks recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| and thought this would be a good time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| to revisit the program because the economy has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| in the core of the city to where a couple, a few more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| we don't anticipate a deluge, but a few more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| of the tax increment financing projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| are going to be coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| And we are fully partners with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| though the city initiates this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| and follows through on the review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| along with Chris Caldwell and others in the county finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| So let me give it just a bit of background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| and I'll be extremely concise on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| and then I'll turn over to Bob Wetzel for a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| specificity about what this program is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| and why we think it's been incredibly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| In fact, to us, it's been the most important program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| we've had in moving from disinvestment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| to investment in the city core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| And as I like to say, in the county core as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| I mean, it's the core of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| Until about in 2004 when I came in with then Mayor Haslam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| we had a lot of projects that could happen downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| in the areas around the industrial part of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| and the center of the city that were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| happening because they were just economically not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| They were upside down from a business perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| for many reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| Probably the main reason was the expenses of either brownfield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| remediation or working with old historic buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| and new codes and the risk involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| Nobody was willing to take on these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| and they just deteriorated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| And looking at county and city taxes at the property tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| base and the appraisals, these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| were producing incredibly minimal returns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| from a tax perspective and in many cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| drawing a lot of services as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| So getting off the dime was what our strategy was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| And one of the main tools we used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| was tax increment financing, which in studying this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| and coming in, we saw it was very successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| in many other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| Also has the potential not to work well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| if you're not very disciplined and careful about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| And that's been one of the watch words we've used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| What we saw was underperforming properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| in the core of the cities, lots of potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| existing infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| The roads were already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| Utilities were already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| Minimal government expense in servicing properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| if they once got restored and no need for new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| And we were pretty well stuck with this lack of investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| With particular emphasis on the historic structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| we opened up a very open and transparent and very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| publicized process by which a developer could participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| with the government, with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| and the county in deferring some taxes being paid for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| such that the dollars that were paid would be directed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| to pay off part of a construction loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| That is, if the project was upside down, did not work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| if we deferred the taxes for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| or had the taxes paid to pay off part of the construction loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| then the project could become feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| And that's the nature really, as short as I can state it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| of what tax increment financing is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| It's freezing the taxes, dedicating new taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| some of the new taxes, to paying off a construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| loan that closed the gap and made a project feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| So what we did was open this up and started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| using this tool with great care, opened it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| to a manner of submitting proposals and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| And let me briefly explain the logic of our review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| and the logic of the implementation of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| If a developer comes and says, I have a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| it's not working, why should we interfere in the marketplace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| I mean, what that's saying is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| is something that's just not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| Maybe it shouldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Well, if there are external forces at work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| that is, our codes that make building difficult or already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| existing deteriorated infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| in private infrastructure in brownfields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| then it would make sense for us to participate in that program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| but only under certain cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| The first hurdle would be, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| to know that project would not occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| if we didn't use this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| That's called the but-for test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| That is, if somebody comes in and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| I want to do, let's say, one of our most successful ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| was the Holston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| That was deteriorating, producing little taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| ineffective building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| And when the developer came to us and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| we would like for you to work with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| and have the city and county taxes dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| to paying off this loan, we first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| had to be assured that that was necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| We took that to the bank, to bankers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| We got a lot of help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| We looked over their pro forma, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| could see that nobody in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| would invest in that project because there was no way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| you could ever collect the rents or sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| the units for a price that would work in the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| here that would ever make it feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| So we were convinced that that project wouldn't happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| but for our participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| The second and the trickier one is the public interest test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| Well, is it in the public's interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| to make this happen because we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| to use this very carefully and in a disciplined manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| because this is an exception to stimulate development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| And in this case, that call was easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| The public interest was the rehab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| of an existing historic building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| and bringing people downtown and having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| people who would spend money and all the good things associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| So we always apply this two-pronged test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| the but-for test, and the public interest test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| And though we don't think it's fair to take projects out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| that we turn down, we turn down a lot of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| based on one or both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| That is, we're convinced this project could help work anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| without this participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Or even if it didn't, it's not in the public interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| to get into that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| So just to summarize, and Bob will get into more specifics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| I think, that will round this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| When we use tax increment financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| a couple of things to stress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| There is not a dollar of appropriated money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| that goes into that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| That is, when we've taken these to previous commissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| and most of the time to councils, what we've said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| is, we're not asking anybody to write a check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| and to pull anything out of the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| This project's gonna produce a lot more taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| You're gonna get some of it, and Bob will explain that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| the deficit portion, immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| And then we'll get the rest of it later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| in order for this project to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| So that's the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| And the second is, once the project is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| by where we're facing them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| we're not adding to the service burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| That is, nobody has to build a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| nobody has to put in any utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| And so, you know, true, if people move town with kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| there might be a few in schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| but those schools are where you got plenty of vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| We have to pay for a little more pickup of garbage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| and so forth, and a little more public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| but it's very marginal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| We've got those services in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| We don't have to worry about all the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| and all the other things that, usually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| government has to do to support development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| So what I'd like to do, before I turn it over to Bob,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| and I know we're moving quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| but we think Q&A is a better way to approach this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| than droning on excessively in lecture mode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| or discussion mode, you've got a sheet in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| and we've, though, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| this is, we're in the city, when we present something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| what I've presented here, we've presented here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| is purely the effect on county taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| And here is a list of all of our TIF projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| that we've had since we've begun this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| and you can see there, it's fairly extensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| And it's until tax year 2014, that's not all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| that's up to 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| Appreciate that, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| That's starting, yeah, starting in 05| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| and going through the 14 appraisal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| And you can see, each project, the impact on the tax base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| the pre-project appraisal, by the assessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| and then the current appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| And this is just county taxes, not city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| which are similar, but a little larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| The pre-appraisal, pre-project appraisal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| was a little under $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| Those same properties are now appraised at $103 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| So one of the major goals here is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| let's reinvigorate the tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| And these are county taxes that are now going to be drawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| off of the current appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| The next two columns involve the actual collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| of taxes now, and you'll see there are two columns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| and we found this is useful to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| The one is, immediately, that is right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| in these projects, the sum of the increase is paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| The part that's paid is that which represents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| the proportion of the county budget that's debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| the percentage of the entire budget that's debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| And right now, county and the cities is slightly higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| Knox County is receiving 126,000, little over 126,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| a year in increased property taxes from these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| Once they roll off and they're going to start rolling off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| in just a few years, the county will be getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| 615,000 a year in new taxes from these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| And obviously, the city, likewise, gets an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| And overall, from sort of a business perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| this deferral of these taxes, invigoration of the tax base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| creation of downtown Knoxville and downtown Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| as an economic engine is really working well, we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| And we'd like to continue the project, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| and we want to work in cooperation with County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| in doing so as our partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| So what I'd like to do is turn it over to Bob Wetzel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| and then we can answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| And I will end with one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| I always tell my staff, and I was neglectful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| we have Rick Emmett, who's our downtown coordinator here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| and many of you know Christy Branscom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| She's our chief operating officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| very knowledgeable about development issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| and construction issues, and they work closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| with us on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| I always tell our staff, we're one bad project away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| from endangering this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| Being one bad project, meaning issuing or recommending this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| to a project that clearly doesn't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| Then what we're doing is enriching a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| I mean, that's all we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| We're also one bad project away from endangering this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| if we don't conduct this in a totally fair, open project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| We don't even know who many of these people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| before we meet them, and that's the way we want to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| And many of the ones we've turned down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| have been from people we happen to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| So that is on us, and the third thing I will say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| in terms of the participation of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| through County Commission's legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| we work closely with Chris Caldwell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| and his predecessors before on making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| that the project makes sense and that he understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| and can support what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| as both from the but-for and the public interest benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| So I'll turn it over to Bob to get a little more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| on this sheet and on the project that will be coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| Thank you, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| As he stated, my name is Bob Wetzel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| Director of the Office of Redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| City of Knoxville, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| One thing before we move off the big sheet Bill summarized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| which is a very good sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| and he talked about the Holston building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| We always talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| I think just sitting here noticing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| there's four of these buildings on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| that were not on the tax basis at all before these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| If you look down through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| the Candy Factory was publicly owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| That was sold and turned into condominiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| which increased the tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| The Victorian houses were done at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| as part of World's Fair site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| moved that back onto the tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| 500 Block is now where the theater is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| or all sorts of plans, what might happen there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| but it was publicly owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| It's been since renovated and generating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| And then the landings was part of the downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| or part of the property the city bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| back when it did volunteer landing 15, 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| So we put a lot of properties back on the tax roll here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| that weren't there at all to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| What you see on the second sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| and Bill gets into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| there's a couple of sheets behind you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| That's just a worksheet that we use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| and I'm not gonna try to explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| that worksheet from this podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| I have a hard enough time explaining that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| at the desk sometimes with folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| But what it does is it basically takes us through a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| of what is the current value of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| what is the proposed future value of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| and determine that, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| We go see Jim Weaver, who's a county property assessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| and we kinda go through the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| on how much income's gonna come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| what's the square footage, things along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| And then we go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| The sheet you see here now is a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| that we propose to bring to you all next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| and we wanted to come start the education this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| before we got here where we had to take a vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| It's especially complicated because it has both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| commercial and residential property attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| It is a mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| It's at the corner of Central and Willow in the old city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| where we have the old Big Don's Costumers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| It has a roof falling in and crashing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| And by the way, that's a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| that nobody's received tax dollars on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| for at least the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| If you look, there's a $25,000 tax deficit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| on that property at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| which when this closing occurs, this project goes forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| that'll get paid, plus we'll start to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| all this new taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| So anyway, that's what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| That particular unit's 15 condos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| and six residential units at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| If you look at the blue at that sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| kind of at the bottom of that sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| I've got an area highlighted in blue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| and that kind of gives you the details on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| kind of like what Bill talked on the big one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| The current property tax, we just read the county line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| Currently, we're supposed to be getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| 3,298 out of those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| Remember, one of them we're getting nothing out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| at this point in time and haven't for the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| Then during the TIF period, you all will get $9,960,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| and that's a 28.6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| That's how much of your budget is allocated towards debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| You don't have that much debt, and it's the same with ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| but it's allocated to service debt if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| That number's jumped up for you all recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| and that helps you in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| and that's what the state requires that we keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| And then there will be an increase of up to 35,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| of the county at the end of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| So you take a property that's vacant, falling in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| owes back taxes, and you help a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| come into a high-class development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| You get it on the tax rolls, and the public benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| is you remediate the blight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| and you get new development in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| and then that generates all sorts of new income tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| or sales tax dollars, which the net migration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| to the city right now on that is pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| We're doing a pretty good job on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| So that is our public benefit on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| is we are remediating blight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| and leading to redevelopment of the core of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| And but forward, it's very clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| that this project would not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| This is roughly a $600,000 TIF loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| This would not happen without this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| The bank says, for us to get comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| we need to have this much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| There needs, between the equity of the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| and what the bank's willing to put in, this is a gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| and this is what we think we can fund at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| If you look over the third sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| it's just a little chart that kind of summarizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| puts it in graphic form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| I always find it's good if you look at that in graphic form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| You've got the current property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| and you have the tax received during the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| and then you have the property tax after TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| So with the TIF, the graph shows it fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| We have stabilized where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| We increased it during the period of time of the TIF period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| and then after that, it goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| So there's that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| One other thing I did want to touch base with you on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| besides the numbers, was the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| So let me just get you a little bit on the process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| Yeah, Bill made a great point there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| On the TIF note that goes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| the developer takes out the TIF note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| This is not a note that the city or the county takes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| and there's no recourse back to either the city or the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| That stays totally with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| So if the taxes don't go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| that developer still has to pay that debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| The city or the county does not have to pay any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| That developer goes under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| He is still the one that has to pay that debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| And then if that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| then obviously the TIF deal is broken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| and then we get it back at whatever we would have had anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| which, you know, you don't want that to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| because you want everybody to be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| The more people are successful, the more successful all of us are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| and that's what we want to see happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| Just real quickly on the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| we receive an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| I'll give you an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| In May, I received six applications for TIFs for pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| Right here, as we go into July, three of those are still alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| One's alive as a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| Two are still alive as a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| And they're all pretty interesting projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| They are a core downtown project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| which is the goal of our office is to get that revitalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| to be the economic engine for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| or for the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| Anyway, we receive applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| Staff, we review those applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| for information and clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| Then we go to answering the two questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| you've already heard about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| the but-for question and the public benefit question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| And if we feel like at staff level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| those are reasonable, we take it to senior staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| both of the city and of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| to review those before we go anywhere else with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| Once we do that, if that has received general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| yeah, that seems to make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| Let's keep this process alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| Then we talk to the property assessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| about what the future value may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| In the case of a TIF, we schedule a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| And you're required to have three announcements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| of a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| And the public hearing for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| at 120 and 122 South Central, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| it's this coming Thursday, KCDC, 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| if you want to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| We usually don't have a lot of attendance of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| but it's out there, if you'd like to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| we'll be there and we'll be talking more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| And then after that is cleared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| what we try to do on those is make sure we set the agendas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| like this is all on the August agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| We will take this to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| to their first meeting in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| If they approve, we will come to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| at your meeting in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| And then if you all approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| we'll take it to the KCDC board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| the last meeting in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| If we get approval from all three of those bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| then we turn it as city staff over to KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| to manage the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| They are the ones that move forward with the closings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| to do all the intricate legal details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| KCDC uses Bassberry Sands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| Mark Mammenthoff is their attorney for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| and he uses them, they use them on all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| to help us make sure we're doing everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| in accordance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| So that's kind of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| just wanted to let you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| So we think we have a good process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| we think we have a good project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| a good program, and I would just like to close with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| Remember, this is a tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| And so there's been a lot of success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| but it's just like anybody else's toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| If you have a tool that's worked for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| don't put it away, you don't put it in the closet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| just because you've been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| You kind of pull that tool out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| and continue to use it as you need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| So that's what we have here as a tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| It's been successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| it's helped us create a whole new environment in downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| and we hope to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| you all have on that at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| So thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| Are there any questions of commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| I think traditionally as a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| we have dealt with, I think Publix was a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| was that a TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Publix and Wal-Mart, University Commons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| It had public infrastructure improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| This one's a little different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| but it's a, similar to the Holston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| it's a change in the economics of the building and the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| So, but there's no questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| So I guess, will it be on our agenda next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| Yes, that's our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| That's our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| Yes, what's the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| do you know the due date for the waterfront project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| The trustee's office has, to my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| has sent two payments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| but they have been unable to get the due date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| from the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| The due date for the Baptist Hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| No, for the, well the South Knoxville Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| is how it's listed, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Oh, for the South Knoxville Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| the district TIF that's on the South Water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| the entire South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| All right, now I understand the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| Let me ask you a question again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| let me see if I can help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| The question is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| The due date for those payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| The due date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| Yeah, we, we collect the taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| taxes are collected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| and then we pay as, as billed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| Now that's not part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| I'm on the front end of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| I'm not on the back end where you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| and I'm not sure the exact answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| but I'll be happy to get that to you very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| Tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| And let me add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| we've run through this kind of quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| and either on anything that we run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| kind of, kind of may have passed over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| and been a little confusing on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| or on any projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| we would love to meet individually as needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| just to go over and make everybody comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| and go down to the project with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| or have the, the developer talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| One thing I think to add real quickly is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| you know, I'm glad Mr. Brantley asked that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| because that's a little different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| that's a TIF district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| that's South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| which is set up where money increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| and the whole area comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| and it goes back in to feed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| to provide for infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| in the entire South Waterfront area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| as opposed to any specific project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| Now Baptist is carved out of that as a specific project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| Most of ours are, are individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| what we call project TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| and not district TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| There are two ways to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| and, and as, as Commissioner Anders said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| the, the, the infrastructure's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| that's sort of the reverse logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| The infrastructure's already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| the removal of the blight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| and the fix, and the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| and the improvement in economic conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| of the city and blighted areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| and the county and blighted areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| is the public benefit there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| as opposed to infrastructure to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| Commissioner Brantley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Yeah, I, I think the city has been very effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| with the downtown area and what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| I congratulate you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| I mean, we're really looking forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| to the waterfront too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| because that's, that's really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| and then, then when the county does a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| for instance, I'm thinking of Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| I drive by that all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| and I don't know how many years ago that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| that TIF was given for that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| but there's been nothing happen there at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| so there's been no change whatsoever there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| And the, also, I wonder there's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| am I correct in there's three elements to a TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| You've got the city, if it's in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| and of course the county's part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| and then the development corporation is also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| The city, the county, and KCDC, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| Who is responsible for seeing that the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| did what they said they were going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| I would add one thing to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| that those that are out, there are two types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| KCDC, the ones in redevelopment areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| which have been in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| have been the ones we've described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| There's also, through the development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| and the IDB, can also do TIFs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| for different kinds of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| They can do them through a different matrix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| of consideration for job creation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| or for building business parks and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| And that IDB is the, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| was the home of the other TIFs you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| that the county has engaged in outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| North Shore Town Center, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| went through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| And then the other part of that question was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| who makes sure that a project gets done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| as it's described?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Well, that the developer does what they said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| they were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| That becomes a responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| KCDC would manage these TIF programs for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| If they see a problem come up with one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| then they report it to us and then we have to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| We had a great example with the City View Riverwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| Unfortunately, an unfortunate example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| where the developer went bankrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| And so he could not deliver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| So we had to go through a long legal process with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| and use bonds and do all sorts of stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| to make sure that the project was delivered as promised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| or as close to promise as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| I would also add that when we do projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| we engage in development agreements with the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| that they must perform as they promised to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| That sometimes has been a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| How do we, once the building gets moving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| I just wonder if somebody ever goes back and reads it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| and says, are they doing what they said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| they were going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| But they're still bonded, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| They're bonded for what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| That's correct, if they've gone that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| The first step on this is after everybody approves these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| there still has to be a development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| that's agreed on through KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| that really specifies all the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| That may or may not have been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| on the one you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| I don't know yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| But that's another slow part of the process sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| Who decides what the length of term is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| either 15 years or the new ones look like 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| We work with the developers and their bankers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| to try to determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| We're trying to hold them all at 15 years, if possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| unless it's a really big project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| that has real big economic impact at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| There's a lot of, we believe in doing the smaller projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| and the bigger ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Some of the bigger ones are tougher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| So that's pretty much it between discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| between the developer, the staff, and the bankers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| And then ultimately, you all have ultimate authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Let me add one thing we should have mentioned there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| that I think is worth saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| Sometimes you'll see, oh, here's a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| and it was a $50 million TIF, and wow, that's huge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| instead of a $5 million TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| Well, the size of the TIF is a function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| of the amount of investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| I mean, it's big only because it's going to produce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| so many new taxes that the number gets huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| And we generally think the bigger, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| But there's a public relations component of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| that some people naturally go, whoa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| what's all that money going to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| That means they're investing a lot more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| So that's a component we should have spoken to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| But the metric is the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| And we obviously push back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| That's a negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| We have to be convinced they need all that they say they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| Some of them, it's fairly obvious by the scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| of the project that there's huge risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| and not only risk, but huge investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| Others, we have really, I guess, gone back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| almost universally and pushed back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| from the number of years that are requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| There's no hard science to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| We've had a lot of experience with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| And sometimes we push hard, and they go, well, never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| We can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| And then we've got a blighted property that stands there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| But that's the lack of perfection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| And just sometimes, we're going to err.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| We don't want to err on too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| We'd rather push on them a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| First of all, you all have done a wonderful job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| with downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| As someone who has grown up here and lived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| through the 70s and the early 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| it's wonderful to be able to go downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| I do question, most of these projects, as you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| are small, well, not necessarily small projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| but residential and mixed-use projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| At what point does a downtown collect critical mass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| and the powers of the market can take over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| I mean, is everything going to need a TIF from here on out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| No, there's a lot of development going on in downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| now that's not using a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| It's only when you get to specialty projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| That's why I use the analogy of a good tool in the toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| You don't want to use it all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| but there are times, no matter how successful you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| to get a particular project done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| you might need to bring this tool out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| no matter how much momentum you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| That could be because of the condition of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| It could be because of the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| just all sorts of various factors that come into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| Well, how bad off is the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| You know, one we wrestle with now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| that's probably going to go down to Pilot Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| and not to TIF Road is the old Farragut Hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| I mean, if you still have a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| in downtown Knoxville that hasn't been renovated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| there's something special wrong with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| or there's something especially complicated about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| And those are the projects that we try to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| at this point in time, really complicated ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| And do you look at the factors of what developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| paid for the project and make sure he's negotiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| that down as far as he can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| We certainly pay attention to what he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| We talk about the negotiating process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| There's not a way for us to be able to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| where they got that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| That's his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Our job is to determine is there a public benefit to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| and would it go forward without us at this point in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| I understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| We can't really get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| But we do ask the question, what did you pay for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| Answer a couple of your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| which are right on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| Number one, we don't want everybody just to assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| they're going to get a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| Because then a landowner can just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| well, I'll just up the price so that in order for it to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| it has to have a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| So we're very careful not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| But that's right on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Secondly, we need more residents to bring about more retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| We'd like to get more office use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| But really, it's almost defined by what works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| for that investor on that spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| So we've supported some pure residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| They are tending to move, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| out into the more difficult, challenging areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| like out Magnolia, heading east on Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| where we really love to see that investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| and the whole energy move toward the east successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| And that's something we have the Magnolia Warehouse District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| So we're going to look to be extra encouraging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| for somebody there, especially in a blighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| old battery building or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| as a natural candidate for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| It will probably be residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| But that's somewhat dependent on the energy in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| The core of downtown, as Bob said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| really the main building left is the Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| That's the big challenge, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| We don't have that much left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| And a lot of them, they've not applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| or we've said we don't think you need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| But an awful lot are taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| without TIFs now downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| Some people have said that the use of TIFs on residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| simply spreads the tax burden to the rest of the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| What kind of population growth has downtown had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| since you've started this effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| And have you seen a larger demand on your services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| As you mentioned earlier, trash pickup, police protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| And it also does put additional services on the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| for these new residents, even if they're in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| Yeah, I guess I would have to push back on that notion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| that we've heard that articulated a little bit, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| I know, to which you refer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| Our feeling is that in most of these areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| there are minimal new services, especially minimal city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| and even fewer county services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| directly going to have to be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| From the city point of view, we probably have a net...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| When you have a building that meets fire code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| rather than being massively deficient and is developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| rather than in a magnet for bad behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| you probably get fewer fire and police calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| than that's on the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Some of the health calls are obviously going to impact...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| Public health calls are going to be on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| So we think it's probably a net gain altogether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| not a net loss with service other than providing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| you know, trash pickup and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| In terms of placing a burden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| we really don't believe it places any burden on anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| We think it's creating new tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| One thing I didn't say is this is one of the few areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| the core, where almost universally the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| in quote, want this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| Y'all, as city council and county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| often know that development out in many places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| you get an awful lot of pushback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| We don't want it. There's too much density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| You know, it's going to add to traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| It's going to add to the schools and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| So one of the benefits we think is concentrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| in this area of the county for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| is that it'll invigorate the tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| And what we like to say is this adds to the denominator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| This 600,000 will be coming in a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| in county property tax base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| adds to the ability to fund services all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| And likewise, we say that to our city residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| And this is where the greatest opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| to generate growth occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| It's a very complex...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| I mean, the criticisms or the things you've said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| we have heard, and they're good points of discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| we think, to engage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| But that's our response to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| Well, again, thank you for the work y'all have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| and congratulations on your upcoming retirement, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| I like the 15 years and not going over 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| but I know we've had some...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| Wasn't Baptist Hospital a 30-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| or something around there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| 25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| I think it's 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| 25, I think's where we are at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Once again, huge project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| We're looking at $120 million potential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| We haven't seen that yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| but we have potential on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| Who makes that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Is it a combination of the bank and the TIF process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| In that case, a lot of that was driven by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| how much the potential investment was going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| and what the public infrastructure was going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| that evolved on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| Blount Avenue being redone, redoing the Riverwalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| the plazas that will be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| the public plazas that we have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| So there's a lot of public infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| that will be done there as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| and that kind of drove that to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| I think it's going to be a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| And that was one, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| I'm glad you brought that one up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| where we were afraid that we were just going to be stuck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| with that deteriorating hulk of an abandoned hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| I mean, we were very happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| when a developer came in to take that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| On the other hand, they were obviously in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| you know, for financial remuneration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| like anything else, and we want to work with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| and make sure the public interest is protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| But we were, in many cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| being able to have somebody else take all the investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| and go to all the risk to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| In this case, as Bob said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| a lot of that is the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| associated with the public plazas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| public walkways and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| and we hope that it...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| Also, these projects downtown and there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| the other hope is they draw people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| from outside the county downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| I'd say the Holston has probably at least 40%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| if not 50% of the folks there have come from other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| because they think downtown's nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| and they'd like to retire here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| That's a net win, of course, all the way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| We're not just moving, you know, dollars around the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| when that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| I'd like to echo, y'all have done a wonderful job downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| I'm not a downtown person, but I'm becoming that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| as I see more and more projects getting done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| So y'all have done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| And you've been, anyway, county, county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| county administration, Mayor Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| Chris Caldwell have all been a terrific help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| and terrific partners in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| And as I've said to many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| you know, I hope everybody sees it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| We're the regional hub and we're downtown Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| Everybody says we're downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| I mean, this is, and we want it to serve everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| and be something everybody can come to and feel part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| and ownership in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| Hey, Mr. Lyon and Mr. Wetzel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| how much of a tip was on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| what was the arrangement on the Publix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| and University Commons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| Do you remember? I'm assuming you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| Yeah, yeah, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| That was a $60 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| There was a $10 million TIF on that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| that was used generally to remediate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| the brownfield site that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| They had to build their structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| on what was currently a brownfield site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| which is, obviously, it's much easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| to build a parking lot in a greenfield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| off an interstate exit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| than it is on an old industrial site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| And, you know, here's the question I wanted to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| because I heard this from a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| They said the TIF is being given there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| and that project is going to put other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| businesses out of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| by taking business away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| Did you hear any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| Because I heard a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| I heard that on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| I've heard zero of that on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| Well, if they're gone, yeah, you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| I mean, did you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| No, we've heard the idea of redistributing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| you're not building new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| but what you're saying, and Bill was talking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| we are a regional hub,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| and we feel like the more that we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| this kind of investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| the more people will come in and shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| I guess how do you tackle that is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| How do you answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| How do you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| Well, I think we understand that concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| but the question, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| the overriding question for us would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| what happens to that brownfield site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| if we don't try to make a good project like this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| We need to make projects happen on our brownfield sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| Let me add to that some...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| The Cumberland merchants as a whole were very favorable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| That's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| A lot of people thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| it's in a shopping center kind of analogy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| that's the big draw to bring people down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| and they're not really Walmart and Publix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| are minimally, I guess, Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| I mean, the Walmart and the Publix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| probably compete more with the Walgreens down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| in terms of some overlap of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| but definitely we want to keep from just moving retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| around to different places, and we do hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| That's kind of the question I'm asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| is you look at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| we've got those services there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| Are we just going to pull from one to give to somebody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| Right. I think our answer there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| we really support the project in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| was the long-term disinvestment in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| brownfield deterioration, to get economic energy there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| and there are other factors we put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| For instance, job opportunities for people in the core city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| to go and work in retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| and not have to go all the way out to Turkey Creek, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| and also providing, you know, good quality food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| in what's known as a food desert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| Those are all the pluses, and we have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| we would never support just something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| for a grocery store as a grocery store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| that would be competing with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Though a side benefit is having a little more competition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| raises everybody's game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| but you really hit one of the key concerns always there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| which is we want to add to everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| and not shift things around merely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| and that's a challenge, and we do think about that a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| and that one is one where it was a little more explicit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| than it is otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| Generally, adding good quality housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| to the residential base is a plus for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| Some adding competitive retail in situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| where you might be disadvantaging somebody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| is, you know, is something we're concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| but there's really not any other way to invigorate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| you know, sites such as we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| where the old industrial plant was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| So that's a real question that you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| It's just concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| I just want to make sure that when we do these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| we make sure the citizens are at ease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| that we're not going to put somebody else out of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| just for the sake of building on some site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| Yeah. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Great, great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| All these points are great points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| That was one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| For those of y'all that have been on this panel a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| I've not been in favor of a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| You know, at one point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| they put a Walmart out, you know, North Knotts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| and, of course, the one at North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| I think would be a poor example of a but-for or the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2592)|
| 0:43:19| But that particular one, Publix Walmart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| that was, to me, is a perfect example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| The only other thing I would have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| pie-in-the-sky would have rather had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| would have been industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| There's no way a factory's going to be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| in the middle of UT and, you know, that core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| So that, to me, was going to be a brownfield forever and ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| had it not been for this tip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| And also, and you touched on it, Bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| that was a food desert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| That is, you know, and currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| it's still not being fully served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| Like you say, at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| the folks in Fort Sanders are probably looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| for something quick going to the Walgreens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| which is not, you know, the place to get fresh food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| and fruits and vegetables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| So, to me, that's the, that was a great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| I didn't see S&W.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| Could you, was S&W a, was that a county or was that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| I know there was a TIF associated with S&W.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| Was that not in the theater TIF, the 500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| Oh, was that a pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| It may have been a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| 500 Block TIF, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| 500 Block, yeah, that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| Oh, it's incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| Yeah, that's one of the 500 Block, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| And that's actually a good one to bring up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| because that actually failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| Right, so how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| We got the taxes because somebody came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| and took the project over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| and developed it into something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| But even had it stopped being built there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| we would have been no worse off than we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| That is, who, somebody lost money on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| They were private investors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| and not the county or in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| And that's one question we got early in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| We want to make sure we're not putting any taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| at risk for projects, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| Okay, so with that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| if it would have just gone to the 20% and went flatline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| we would have taken the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| I guess what you did, and marked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| And then if nothing happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| how does that, how does the original taxes get...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| Well, see, we were on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| That had zero tax because the city owned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| And the county had owned it at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| Remember, there were all kinds of flipping those things around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| What we love doing is working on ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| that are producing no taxes like that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| at the Candy Factory and a few others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| because that's nothing but a plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| Actually, the bank is on the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| We wouldn't sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| The bank would sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| If the project failed, the bank sells it at auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| And we're a lien holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| Yeah, I just wonder how that TIF would go to the next...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| To the next developer, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| As a fiscal conservative free market believer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| the University Commons was absolutely the best thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| that could happen to that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| You took care of a brownfield environmental problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| and provided the services that people needed in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| Normally, I wouldn't support a retail TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| but that was a perfect answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| Dr. Lyons, Mr. Wetzel, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| We'll see you in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| We appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Will we see you in August, Mr. Wetzel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| You will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| On a contractual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| I'm still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| All right, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| Item number 8, Resolution 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| It's accepting the resignation of Cindy Buttrey, District 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| on the Knox County Board of Zoning and Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2794)|

| 0:46:40| of Cindy Buttrey expiring September 30, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| I'd like to make a motion to pass without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| We've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2811)|

| 0:46:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| Next item, page 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| Item number 18, Resolution 210.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| It's approving the use of Tennessee statewide contract number 222| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| for vehicle leasing with Acme Auto Leasing, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| for the purpose of leasing 14 vehicles for driver's education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| for a period of 36 months at a cost of $67,134.48 per 12-month period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2837)|
| 0:47:24| for a total amount of $201,403.44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| Dr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| Mr. Thomas or Dr. McIntyre, Bob, I guess since I already talked to you about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| you probably have an answer by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| Bob Thomas, Knox County Schools, Andrew Johnson Building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| right across the street, and I have with me Don Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| Don is our Director of Career and Technical Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| and I do appreciate you, Commissioner Brown, giving me a heads up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| so I could at least have someone here to address some of your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| Well, my question was, in this case, if my Mildred Doyle mathematics are correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2889)|
| 0:48:18| 14 vehicles are $201,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| There's about to be about $14,400 per vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2901)|
| 0:48:27| If I'm buying 14 vehicles, I can go out here and buy them for less than $14,400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| Why are we spending more to lease them than we could buy them for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| Well, the cost to lease the vehicles per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| is less than it would be to buy 15 cars in one year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| We also refunded the money from the state for the lease of the cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| We received about $98,000 back from the state for those leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| Versus buying them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| Do you get new cars every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| Yes, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| Or will the car last three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| Well, this contract would last for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| In the past, we've been getting new cars every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| That works out to about $12.87 per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| But you're saying you get these 14 cars now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| and a year from now you're going to get 14 new ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| No, these cars will be a three-year lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| And it's still cheaper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| Well, if you do the math and we looked at buying the cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| the cars are right at $20,000 per car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| That would come off of some of the bid contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| that were let out just a year ago or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| So if you do the math, at $20,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| you're only going to be able to buy five cars per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| and we're using 15 cars per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| So we would somehow be short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| We also use that overage for fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| So if we use the money to buy five cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| we wouldn't have the fuel money for purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| Who furnishes the upkeep on these vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| Well, under the lease contract, that's part of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| The leasor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| Beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| The leasor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| Takes care of all the maintenance and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| They blow an engine up or they wreck it and they fix it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| The only thing that we have to take care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| is if we have an accident in the car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| because we're self-insured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| Commissioner Willoughby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| Yeah, thanks, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| Okay, if I do the math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| it's been a while since I've been in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| but I think I can do that and subtract it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| You're looking at $399.61 per vehicle per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| I mean, it sounds like a pretty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| what kind of cars are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| I mean, it doesn't sound like they're Camaros or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| Those are 2015 Ford Tauruses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| I don't think it's really excessive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| and I think it's a state contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| We piggybacked off of the statewide leasing contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| Well, that's what I was going to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| It is a state contract that's been negotiated by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| Also, I guess the only way you look at this is you back off the backing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| if there's any residual from selling the car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| and then you have to factor in the maintenance and upkeep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| I guess the only downside is I wish we could get a nine-month lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| since we probably won't be using them two months from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| Well, we actually do use the cars during the summer for driver's ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| That's the only real question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| All right, we've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| Even though it's a state contract that's based out of Connecticut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| did you even try any of the local dealerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| to see if they would offer something comparable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| In talking to the local dealerships, Reeder Chevrolet was a company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| we had been using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| They did not want to enter into a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| They would do a rental, which is a little more difficult to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| So the lease contract actually worked out saving us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| If you take into account the cost to put the brakes in the cars each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| and adding the stickers and everything that we have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| we're going to save about $3,700 per year in cost on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| So we'll save around $7,500 in cost there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| All right, we've got Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Hey, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| Just one quick question because I just thought about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| Are these cars like specially equipped in the sense like another brake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| on the passenger side or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| We actually, when we take possession of the car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| the dealership puts the brake in the passenger side for the driver's head instructor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| No steering wheel, just the brake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| All right, we've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3165)|

| 0:52:59| It's approving real estate sales contracts for delinquent tax surplus properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3179)|

| 0:53:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| We've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Yeah, I guess you hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| Can you bring your mic down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| Is Hugh Holt here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3196)|

| 0:53:24| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| If you maybe could kind of give us an update of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| We had a list two or three months ago of several pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| and I know you've got a couple of them listed here on this month's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| but how are we in regards to the whole list you had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| How much progress are we making?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| We are making excellent progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| Ben Sharvel, 1301 Hickory Oak, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3226)|
| 0:53:53| We made about $450,000 in the rebid auction, which is really, really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3233)|
| 0:54:00| That's about triple of what we made last year on the same number of properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| We are currently on this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| There are about 96 properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| There are still three or four we're working through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| We've had some issues that we're having to revisit on one or two of the larger ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| where somebody didn't pay, they didn't pay their deposit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| we're working with Daniel Sanders, delinquent tax attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| We may be getting into some legal issues with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| just because there is no precedent legally of what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3272)|
| 0:54:38| But with that being said, we're making excellent progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| I just thought the public needed an update on where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| We're moving it as fast as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3287)|

| 0:56:29| to the Board of Commissioners of the Knox Chapman Utility District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| Oh, we don't need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| I think we've had one discussion for the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| I thought that possibly Commissioner Wright would bring this up, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| but next month we will be getting a resolution recommending the audit company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3406)|
| 0:56:55| for the next four-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| An RFP was put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| If any of you would like to have some late-night reading, Commissioner Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3421)|
| 0:57:11| and I both would share either one of these six or all of the six with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3431)|
| 0:57:16| if you'd like to check over those RFPs before next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3436)|
| 0:57:26| You do not have to return them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| Commissioner Wright, do you have anything else from Audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| Yes, if Commission could pause here for just another moment or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| There are probably about four things that came out of the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| that the full Commission needs to be aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| whether it be this approving of the proposed contract with Pew & Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| to be the external auditor, not this coming year but the four years after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3473)|
| 0:58:00| That was one of the things that was out of the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| recommended to full Commission, which we'll see next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| The fraud, waste, abuse, hotline, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3488)|
| 0:58:16| we did not talk about that in full Commission over the last couple of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| but there has been a new contract implemented which took some time to get done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| because the Audit Committee felt like there was not a change necessary in who gets the hotline reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3505)|
| 0:58:36| We've got a pretty good investment in paperwork and reporting processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3516)|
| 0:58:43| and procedures that people already know and understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| There's no need to retrain, so the company that had provided for the last term rebid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| and was accepted as the current provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| A citizen member of the Audit Committee, David Shields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| is saying about the hotline that we have that it is basically doing for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3542)|
| 0:59:11| what is expected of the industry norm, and we do get reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| and we do have people that take those reports and go look at them and get things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3555)|
| 0:59:22| Speaking of the external audit, Larry Elmore, Principal of Pew, brought to us three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3562)|
| 0:59:32| The preliminary work is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| In other words, he's studying our internal controls and risk assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3574)|
| 0:59:39| The second thing that he brought was that 66 of the 88 school activity funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| have been looked at, audited, and they're on track to get the rest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| that's to move from 66 complete to 88 complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| By the end of the, and this is point number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| the external audit should be finished end of November or early December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3598)|
| 1:00:09| The last thing that I wanted to speak about coming out of the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| is something that's going to touch us in the next meeting or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| and it has to do with an internal audit of the hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3617)|
| 1:00:27| Now, I want to back up and say that I really appreciate Commissioner Smith and Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3627)|
| 1:00:34| and Owen B. and Bessler for dropping in and out and being a part of the meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3634)|
| 1:00:42| This hotel-motel tax is sort of a huge can of worms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3642)|
| 1:00:50| If anything, it's been ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| It's not been handled the way that it should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3655)|
| 1:01:02| and it's brought to light the fact that sales tax is probably being captured by a bunch of hotels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3662)|
| 1:01:13| and not being forwarded to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| And the second part of that is the audit does not really give us a mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3677)|
| 1:01:25| to see which hotel-motel operators may be shortchanging Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3685)|
| 1:01:34| So that's just for your general information, us here on County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3694)|
| 1:01:42| to know that we will have stuff before us over the next couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| to make sure that the taxes being collected are properly forwarded to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3707)|
| 1:01:56| We may have to change ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| We may have to more clearly align with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| But we're speaking of dollars in the amount of maybe in excess of $400,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3722)|
| 1:02:10| that's not being properly reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| What it boiled down to was 44% of the ones they audited hadn't paid or were late paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3733)|
| 1:02:24| If there are any questions about the audit committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| Is that audit final?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| Is it out in public draft?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| The hotel-motel is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| I don't think it's complete yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| I would be skeptical of having a discussion about it publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| There's nothing really to publicly discuss because we can't discuss the names of motels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| because they're not in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| They will not be in the final report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| The nature of the audit is to be, not until it's final, to be public property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| The process of collecting this money in the future is what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| Whether it takes an annual audit, just like I brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3786)|
| 1:03:13| if you've got a hair salon or you've got a burger stand, you've got a business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| And you don't get the business license until you pay your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| So why should they be any different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| If we need to issue, it may, according to David Buick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3808)|
| 1:03:34| it may necessitate a charter change, a resolution change in some form it will legally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3814)|
| 1:03:45| for us to be able to do anything, and that's what they're going to be researching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| Let me clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| This is Audit 2015-3, the Hotel Motel Occupancy Tax Audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3831)|
| 1:03:58| It was issued June 19, 2015, so it can be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| I didn't know it was public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| You guys, is that what she was going to enter, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| There was a statement made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| I just want some clarification on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| You said there's no way to find out if they paid it or not paid the tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| but if they're a business in Knoxville and the people that do pay their tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3857)|
| 1:04:23| is there not a record of the people that have paid their taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| We just need to, I think that goes to the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| Yes, but let me back up in just a second and say there's not a question about have they paid or not paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3872)|
| 1:04:41| We know, according to the internal auditor, the amount that should have been collected per their books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3881)|
| 1:04:48| and we know whether or not they paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| We know all those facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| It will just not be tied to an operator's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| I think there's a state law that says the clerk's office can't release information on business taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3898)|
| 1:05:05| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| I may be wrong on that, totally wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| Well, the thing of it is if you put the person's name down and say, okay, they paid this amount of tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3907)|
| 1:05:14| then you know how much they've made or how their business is operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| That's not the question I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| The question is there is a way for us to find out who's paid and who has not paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| We're not asking for the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| And that is known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| That is known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| That is known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| So that right there is the information that we need to find out who's violating the law by not paying us taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3932)|
| 1:05:40| And we can release that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| We can't release the amount that they have not paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| We can just say, I mean, we can say they haven't paid the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| Well, generally, everybody, all these 44 they went to, they were received amicably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3950)|
| 1:06:01| And for what she said, 99.9% all agreed, you know, with their figures that they owed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3961)|
| 1:06:10| But, you know, sometimes it's like we say, it's easier to get forgiveness than it is permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3970)|
| 1:06:17| And if nobody's watching the hen house, sometimes the fox decides to come in and take one or two this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3977)|
| 1:06:24| But, you know, if you don't lock that gate, pretty soon you've got no hens left in the hen house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| So I think it's more of a situation where it's never been policed, at least for the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=3989)|
| 1:06:41| Mr. Walter, would it be out of character for us as a commission, since the audit's public now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| for you to research the mechanism, number one, on the collection of taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| number two, on trying to begin to collect taxes, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4013)|
| 1:06:59| I think there's been discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| It comes through the clerk's office, but I'm not so sure that it's not paid online now through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| That's something I'd like to clarify and check on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| Well, come January 1st, you'll have another CPA in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| So if we decide we want to do it on an annual basis, we've got the manpower or womanpower to do it with now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4033)|
| 1:07:20| That's what we'll have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| Does that make sense, my inquiry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| Commissioner Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| Going back on this, I was asking those questions so we could have the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| What is our legal responsibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| What can we do to put a bite in to whoever collects the taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| Does that go through the clerk's office, or where does it go through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| Do they need help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| Do they need information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| And then what can we do as the commission to say, hey, there's people that are paying taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4065)|
| 1:07:51| and there's people that are not paying taxes, and what is the recourse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| and how can we make that bite like we did on illegal sale of beer to minors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4074)|
| 1:08:01| Can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4081)|
| 1:08:02| And if we can do that, what do we need to do, and how do we need to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| And if we're going to discuss it next, not this month, but what, September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| Probably August, or we can discuss it in August, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| Okay, you can discuss it in August if it gives it time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| and give us the options of what we need to do and how can we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4097)|
| 1:08:22| Okay, is that enough time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4102)|

| 1:08:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| Perhaps Chris or the law director can help me on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| but I don't believe that we have the power to impose a lien such as we could for real estate taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4112)|
| 1:08:42| I think innkeeper's laws are pretty, I think the lobby at the hotel is pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4122)|

| 1:09:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4174)|

| 1:10:15| We do have parking across Oak Ridge Highway, but if we can avoid having people cross the highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| But we'd love to see you all out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| Is that a tournament during the day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150720?start=4221)|
