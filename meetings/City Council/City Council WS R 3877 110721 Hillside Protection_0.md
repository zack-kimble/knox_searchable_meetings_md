| 0:04:39| I'm an expert in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=279)|

| 0:05:02| and allowing people to work through that process and hopefully come to a place where we can make some really good decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| for the city of Knoxville and Knotts County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| I've got a few things I want to say on the front end before we start talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| One of those, I want to commend you for your willingness to go outside to an outside facilitator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| and your willingness to seek out a cooperative solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| I'll be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| You know when people tend to call us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| Let me tell you, it's not when the bus gets in the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| They tend to call us when the bus got in the ditch, it's overturned, the bus is on fire, and people have died,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=332)|
| 0:05:39| and there's no way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| Then they tend to call and say, hey, do you guys deal with conflict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| Yeah, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| And usually that's when we come into the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| But really, you know, some of my previous conversations I've had before this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| you guys are in much better shape than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| And I'm just really impressed with your willingness to seek a cooperative solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| I mean, let's face it, you guys could have chosen to be competitive, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| I mean, you could have sat down, the county could have voted one way, the city voted the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| or done whatever they decided and let the developers figure out the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| You could have chosen to war with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| And even with the county's previous decision, that 6-5 vote, the commissioner said, you know, let's sit down and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=381)|
| 0:06:27| That is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| And you need to be commended for that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| I know it's not easy in highly charged political environments and in public settings to be willing to be that cooperative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| And I want to acknowledge that on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| I do want to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| My role is as facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| My job is to facilitate a productive discussion about the ridgetop inside Mountain Development in Knox County and Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=408)|
| 0:07:00| It's my understanding, and I've seen it, that a document's been designed, it's been disseminated and developed by a subcommittee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| appointed by these two boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| That document is where the discussion is taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| And over the next four sessions, I want to be focused on the ability to develop that document to the point that it can either be adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=432)|
| 0:07:21| it can be rejected, it can be amended, or whatever needs to happen what's best for this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| That's kind of where we're going to focus, if that's all right with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| I am not an arbitrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| Someone asked me that just a few minutes ago sitting down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| So are you here to make a decision for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=457)|

| 0:07:49| My job is not to tell you what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| My job is to kind of incubate discussion between you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| Talk about some of the things, develop opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| I'll be honest, if you've ever been in a mediation before, any of you guys ever sat through a mediation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| This is not that, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| I mean, there's some elements, Charlie, that kind of look like that, but it tends to be more directive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| The way I would describe it, a facilitation here is going to be a combination of kind of mediation, education, and conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=492)|
| 0:08:21| I may be a little more directive than you're used to with a mediator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| If you've been in a straight mediation before, you may find some mediators primarily just facilitate conversations, stay completely out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=506)|
| 0:08:34| I'm probably a little more involved in that discussion, helping us stay focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| But you need to know, in that process, I am truly a third-party neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=518)|
| 0:08:45| To my knowledge, I have no previous relationship with anybody on this council or on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=525)|
| 0:08:54| I'm barely Tennessean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| I moved here from Texas about four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| All I know, I asked somebody recently in Nashville how long it takes to be Tennessean, and he told me the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| He said, true story, came out in Nashville paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| Apparently, a lady passed away who was 99 years old, and her obituary began with, a North Carolinian by birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=546)|
| 0:09:16| She moved here when she was one year old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| Now, my theory is if in 98 years she couldn't be Tennessean, I am not going to try to be a Tennessean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=559)|
| 0:09:26| But I'm honored to be, this is my adopted state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| But I will say, because of that, I really don't know a lot of people in this arena, and I think that's in our best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| I don't have specific interest in this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| I'll be honest, professionally for this moment, I don't care how you decide, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=582)|
| 0:09:49| My job is to help you move along the discussion so you can decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| And whatever you decide is best for the people of this city and this county is going to be fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| As long as we follow good process, and people have opportunity to be a part of that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| In other words, I am that non-biased third party to help resolve the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| Now, this is a little different because it's a public facilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| They're a little bit of a different animal, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| Now, the great thing about that is pretty much everything you've said, I've been able to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| You know, there is public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| And so people can see that and we can read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| I will say this, for this public facilitation to be productive, I'm going to have to have some private conversations with people also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=634)|
| 0:10:42| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| Now, you know, in fact, I've already visited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| I've visited with three of you already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| But I will be available to anybody, anybody on this council or on the commission that wants to call me, you call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=650)|
| 0:10:57| You guys have, I believe, and I will give you my cell number and my email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=657)|
| 0:11:04| And anytime you want to visit with me, I'm perfectly open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| I will be contacting some of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| I'll be contacting some of the other people in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| I think there are some people who have a vested interest, from what I can tell, in this decision, who are even in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| I'm going to be visiting with some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| My job is to find out what matters to people, listen to people, and be involved in conversation with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| So you need to know that my involvement here isn't just limited to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| Now, you also need to know, when I'm in kind of that private caucus, that's what we call that, we're meeting privately with people, those are confidential conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=690)|
| 0:11:39| That anything said to me in those private conversations, I will not share with other people or publicly unless that individual gives me permission to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=699)|
| 0:11:48| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| Now, here I'm not too worried about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| It's not exactly like there's anything private going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| But if I talk to Marilyn and she tells me something, I'm not going to go and talk to Richard about that unless Marilyn says it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=713)|
| 0:12:01| I want you to feel comfortable with that and know that that is what I'm bound by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| So on the other side, do me a favor and don't ask me what somebody said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| I'll be really kind about that and I'll say I appreciate that, Mike, but I can't tell you because they didn't give me permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=729)|
| 0:12:16| If you give me permission, of course I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| Another thing that jumped out at me before we move on is I am amazed by the amount of respect that you guys are showing each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=738)|
| 0:12:30| Listen, you know, if you think this has gotten a little ugly and maybe it has, I haven't been here all the way through, compared to some of the stuff, this is pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=750)|
| 0:12:41| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| Because when I've talked individually with people, without fail, they have said something along this line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| You know, I may disagree with that person, but that's a really good person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| You know, we don't see alike, but I don't question their integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| Those are the kind of things I'm hearing, which takes us a long way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| I mean, I've sat in some of these things where they're talking about each other's extended family, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| They're making accusations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| They're saying things like I'll never work with that person or whatever they call them, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| And I'm not hearing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| And I might, you know, as we get further into this, people may get more honest with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| But so far, what's impressed me is the amount of respect you've shown each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| And this has gone on, what, how long has it gone on, three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| Mike, is it 2008 this started, this discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| Sir, I understand that that was done by a committee before it got to these bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| They've been out there working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| They've been working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| What was it brought to you, Nick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Do you remember when it was brought to you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| We were just confronting it this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| The county commission is a little bit ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| So this discussion has been going on within the community for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| And you guys have had it since spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| And I'm impressed with how you've done with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| I agree there are some serious disagreements, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| There are people's livelihoods that are being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| There are property rights being talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| There are clean water issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| There are aesthetic issues, community issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| You guys got, you're taking on a tough topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| But I admire that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| The thing I want to do is make sure that we continue to show respect in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=864)|
| 0:14:31| What I mean by that, I'm sure that you guys do this already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| And by the way, Miss Roddy, I'm married to a Californian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| so the use of guy is strictly gender neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| I just want you to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| Number one, we have to be careful not to attribute evil motives to other people in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| So when we're talking to one another, I want us to think about not attributing what other people are thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| You ever heard anybody kind of say, well, I know what they're up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| You know what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| I know what they're thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| I've been married for 30 years, bless her heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| And I tease my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| She tells me quite often she knows what I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| And she's just a really good guesser is all I can say, Brenda, because, you know, I don't have a glass head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| And sometimes when we get in these kind of situations, we start attributing motives to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=923)|
| 0:15:29| You know, I know what Mike Brown is thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| And we're going to do our best not to do that if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| The second thing we don't do is name call on any level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| And, you know, not just kindergarten kind of playground name calling, but, you know, kind of putting people in camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=939)|
| 0:15:49| You're one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| And you can kind of say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| You know, you can say something that's true, but you say it in such a way it's not very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| You're one of those environmentalists, aren't you, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Or you're one of those developer types, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| And we've got to make sure that we make sure that we don't put other people down in this conversation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=960)|
| 0:16:09| And finally, this is one I don't know that you'll do this, but I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| We can't use confidential information as leverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| One thing I may kind of call us out on if somebody says a number of people have told me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=978)|
| 0:16:27| And if you do that, I'll probably say, well, exactly, Tony, exactly, you know, who is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| Well, I can't say they asked me to do that in confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| If that's the case, I'm not going to allow that to direct the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| Because that kind of leverage is not open enough for us during this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| So if you want to talk about something somebody brought to you, make sure that they're comfortable you bringing that out in public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| because we're not going to leverage kind of confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| You know, somebody says a number of people told me something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| Well, one's a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| I mean, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| So we want to be at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| I appreciate you letting me go on the ground rules because we've kind of got to stay at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| In other words, the way I say this is let's speak to each other the way we would like somebody else to speak to our children or our spouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1028)|
| 0:17:17| If we'll do that, we're great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| If we'll show not necessarily how we act but how we like other people to treat our family, that's going to be the basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1039)|
| 0:17:26| It's going to treat each other with respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| By the way, we don't interrupt each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| Normally, if somebody's saying something and we're in kind of this conversation level, you might want to try to get my attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| and we'll follow up with that, but we want to hear what people are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| If you do me a favor, listen respectfully for people's interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| One of the real challenges in an environment like this is not only looking at what people's positions are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1068)|
| 0:17:55| but what their interests are that drive them because those interests are some of the things that we can really use to build leverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1075)|
| 0:18:02| and that will become clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| The last two, I'm going to be bold and say pretty early because you could take this wrong, but I don't want you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1087)|
| 0:18:14| I don't know you and I don't expect you to do this, but I always say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| Please don't attack or leverage your position for political gain or public posturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1098)|
| 0:18:25| I know that's a pretty bold thing to say to a bunch of politicians, but here's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| We've got to work on some stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| If somebody here is kind of posturing for votes or position, it's one thing for you to feel strongly about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1115)|
| 0:18:42| I want you to feel as strongly and as passionately as you possibly can, but let's make sure that's what you want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| and not a leveraging position if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| You guys have to decide what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| Finally, and this is the hardest thing I'm going to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| It is the hardest thing that happens when I work with companies, with families, with organizations or schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1140)|
| 0:19:08| leaving behind past frustrations so we can focus on the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| My guess is a lot of stuff has been said. Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| Some of it face-to-face, some of it to other people, some of it back in the back of this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| It's important that we recognize the past, but I want to focus on the current work and the future possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1165)|
| 0:19:34| If you can help me with that, that would be awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| I just need you to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| For some of you, I would think most of you this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| Anybody in public life, you're kind of used to being teflon, people attacking you and falling off of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| I need you to be able to do that in this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| If someone gets upset and says something they shouldn't or they've talked behind your back and done those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| now is the time to let that stuff fall away if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| Finally, if you could attempt, especially early on from staying away from what I call hard positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1204)|
| 0:20:12| this is it, I'm this, ain't nothing else you can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| Now, I mean, if that's really, really how you feel, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| But sometimes I've noticed in these kind of conversations that can get emotional and there's money attached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1221)|
| 0:20:28| sometimes people think they're in a much more hard, solid position than they really are once we start talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1228)|
| 0:20:36| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| If we stake out too much ground too early, and that's our tendency, by the way, in a competitive negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1239)|
| 0:20:47| I'm going to stake my ground early and then you can work me off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| That works buying a car, doesn't work so hot in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| So if you can find a way to talk about your interests, talk about things you'd like to see accomplished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| but in less competitive, ground staking kinds of ways, that would help me a lot as we do the negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1265)|
| 0:21:13| Is that making sense to you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| And finally, feel free to ask me to clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| Feel free if you don't think I'm making the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| Feel free if you don't think that I'm acting appropriately or I'm taking one side or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| You can say anything you want to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| Seriously, you know what, I get to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| I'm not going to take this personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| At the same time, I want you to be respectful of me like I will be of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| But I want to be completely open in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| And those are kind of the ground rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| Do you have any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| It sounds a lot like what meetings you normally have probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| Are there any questions about that or any concerns you might have about those ground rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1316)|
| 0:22:05| I'd like to see a show of hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| This is just for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Does everybody here kind of agree to those ground rules when we move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| I'm excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| Well, tonight, and understand that we have, in essence, a two-hour block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| but part of that could be for public comment at the end, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| So tonight, in the next hour and 15 minutes or so, I want to start the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| Now, here's the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| You guys have had these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| We've been watching those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| You guys are all over YouTube.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| You're stars, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| It's not hard to find you guys talking about this on YouTube if you've figured that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| You've had these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| I haven't been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| So tonight may feel a little repetitive to some of you, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| Some of you may be thinking, we've talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| Does this guy not know this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| But tonight we're going to work on process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| We need to establish a process of how we make decisions tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| and how we plan to move forward by September 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| I am not guaranteeing you September 1 everybody's fat, dumb, and happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| I mean, you know how that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| But I am committed by September 1 of moving this down the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| to where you are in a place you feel like you can make some good decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| perhaps put closure to this one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| But to do that, we have to have a night of process and listening and talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| and that's tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| The subsequent three meetings every other week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| those are where we're going to get more into the meat of the disagreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| the more of the meat of where we stand and how we resolve those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| But if we don't have the process meeting on the front end, those become difficult to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| Does that make sense to everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1438)|
| 0:24:07| Steve, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| I'm over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| Talking about process in this meeting, given we've got fairly poor attendance tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1451)|
| 0:24:21| how will we handle the lack of participation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| Yeah, that's a concern of mine also, but I plan to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| We're taking extensive and copious notes, and I think this is also available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| will probably be available on YouTube and other arenas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| I'm going to contact each one of the council and commissioners who aren't here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| and ask them to watch it, and I'll send them notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| and I'm going to contact them individually to go through that same process with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| Because we really do need, what would be difficult on us is for somebody to drop in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| two meetings into the process and have a different agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| So it does put somewhat of, Tony, it puts a little more burden on me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| to make sure that everybody who's not here gets that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| But that's part of my job, and I'll just have to make sure that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| It would be easier if everybody was here, but you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| People have other things happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| So I appreciate that, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| We'll work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| Now, what I understand, and this is my summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| we've, me and my staff have kind of read through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| What I understand has happened is that the council and the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| appointed by joint resolution a subcommittee to develop recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| to address the ridgetop and side mountain development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| My understanding, this document was produced by the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| and I believe Tony and Joe Holzk was chair of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| It was brought then to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| You guys had public comment, held hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| and then you voted six to five not to adopt the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| Am I still on target with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| That's the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| County commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| The city hasn't acted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| I'm sorry, the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| The city chose not to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| The city chose not to vote on the topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| My left and right is getting me here, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| I'm going to have to remember who I'm talking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| The city chose not to vote and chose to table the vote on the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| And there was some discussion about do we appoint a new subcommittee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| Do we bring in more people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| And we had discussions along that arena of what we should do to bring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| to find ways to build bridges on this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| And finally, as my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| you guys decided to bring in a third-party facilitator to discuss accepting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| amending, or ignoring the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| Does that seem fairly accurate of the summary of where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| The council did not table the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| That's a very different action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| We postponed action for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| The 60 days will be up at the meeting this coming Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| It will come before council for first reading at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| And so you guys, as of this next Tuesday, the document comes back before you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| That's good information for me to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Thank you, Brenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| This is Richard Briggs over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| I wanted to make a comment just to clarify this is what we're mediating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| I think that some people may have the impression that this is a disagreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| between the county commission and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| and I don't think that's really what we're mediating against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| I don't think there's opposing sides there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| I think really what needs mediating is the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| and I'll try not to use any loaded terms here because we've done that in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| either say you're a developer or you're environmentalists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| I would say the pro-plan people as it was and the people that were against the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| And the people that were against the plan were, in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| and I'll be leaving some people out, but they were the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| and landowners who were dealing with land issue rights and development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1695)|
| 0:28:24| And at least what I would envision this being is not trying to be some sort of mediator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| between the city council and the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| but it really is trying to mediate between the people that were against the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| and the people that were for the plan, which really are going to be your developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| and your landowners dealing with land rights, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| versus those that wanted to put certain restrictions on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| And just to give you a little additional background is that I know Tony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| and Joe had, what was there, 12 community meetings that we had roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| Twelve or 13 community meetings in the different districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| And I think it would be fair to say that for the most part, not all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| because some of them did become very, again, I'm trying to avoid a loaded term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| some of them were debated very ardently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| But anyway, for the most part, they were very poorly attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| and I think it would be very fair to say is that some of the people that were opposed to the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| just weren't at the table because they just pretty much ignored it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| And it wasn't until we actually had a plan there that all of a sudden people came out and said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1766)|
| 0:29:32| I don't like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| And at least what I would see what we're going to have to do with this is to take some of the people that had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| or some of the factions that were against the plan and try to find out at a limited amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1780)|
| 0:29:47| what they didn't like about the plan and see if there's any compromises that can be reached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| But I don't think it was a conflict or name calling between the city council and the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| It's more between the pro plan and the anti-plan people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| And just to put something else on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| because it may leave the impression that many of us on the county commission were against the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| there was a stipulation, and this is just the way the laws or whatever the ordinances were written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1808)|
| 0:30:15| is that we at the time could make no modifications on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| It had to be voted up or down in the fashion it was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| And I believe that some of us voted it down simply because we wanted to make some changes that may not even be very large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| But also to, even though they'd had the opportunity previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| but to give some of the people that may have had some legitimate issues with the plan the chance to modify those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1835)|
| 0:30:43| to see if that would be acceptable to the rest of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| And I think that's really where the mediation needs to be rather than, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| there's a side over there and there's a side over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| It's really between here and the plan and people out there that may have had opposition to certain aspects of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| I think it's really articulate and right on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| I understand that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| It was made clear to me that the commission understood that the only way to amend that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| from their understanding, was to either vote it up or down and then make an amendment and to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| You could even tell by the vote that there's no monolith either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| I plan to spend a significant amount of time with the stakeholders and the community over the next few weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| because I understand that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| My conversations in this room are going to be primarily with you guys because you're the voting body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| Because no matter what happens, it still comes back to this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| But I do not want to, and I appreciate the clarification, Dr. Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| because I don't want to leave the impression the council wants to go one way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| and the county wants to go the other because that is not my understanding at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| And I thank you for helping me clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| What I would love to do to start the conversation tonight then is not so much rehash how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| I think I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| I think all of you understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| But what I'd like to do is just ask why is this so important to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| Why is it important to you individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| There's a lot of things you could be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| There's a lot of things you could be spending time, and yet you've devoted four workshops just to this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| So apparently to some of you, if not all of you, this is an important topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| And what I need to know on the front end is why it's important to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| And the way I'd like to begin this, I think I'm going to start, since you guys have voted on it already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| I'd like to start with the county and take about ten minutes or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| And I don't necessarily, if you want to tell me about history that helps clarify, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| I don't necessarily want you to tell me so much facts, we'll talk about that later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| but why this is important to you and why this drives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| And, Mike, I'm going to let you close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| You'll be the last comment, if that's all right with the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| But I'd like to hear from you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| Why is this so important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| I've got a therapy background, too, so I could stare at you for 20 minutes and be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| I thought you were just going to go down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| No, I'm going to let you guys volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| Why is it important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| Well, as the old saying goes, they ain't making no more land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| And we have to be good stewards of what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| I have, for the last 39 years, been an advocate in my community for good land usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2008)|
| 0:33:35| I'm not anti-development, but I'm for proper development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| And I think this is a good instance here where we have an opportunity to put some rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2019)|
| 0:33:46| and regulations in place that can help things down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| We have to plan ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| We have things brought before us on a continuing basis, and I'm sure that the city council has, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| where that development was slap shot, rough shot, you know, wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2037)|
| 0:34:04| And now we're paying the consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| We cannot take care of all of the water runoff we have right now because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2046)|
| 0:34:13| largely because of poor practices in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| But a proper document in place that will help control some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| You know, we're looking at our grandkids, you know, what they're going to have to be looking to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| And I think it's overall kind of what we're looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| We're trying to plan ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| And I hear you saying it's kind of a legacy issue for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| Is that fair that you want to leave something for your grandkids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| Is that kind of what I heard you saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| I think all of us feel that way to a degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| But, I mean, personally, I'm just telling you that that's where I've been for the last 39 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| and working for the community in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| So it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| And I hear you say that you felt like perhaps in the past we've not managed it as well as we could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| and we've gotten in this spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| If you look at the history of the growth of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| how that it blasted out of the chute and down Kingston Pike West in a lot of cases with poor development practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2108)|
| 0:35:19| it's causing a lot of problems down there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| And I don't want to see that happen in future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| I think we have to look at what we can control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| Somebody comes up and says, well, it's my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| I can do whatever I want with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| Sure you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| As long as it doesn't adversely affect someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| And that's where these bodies have the ability to kind of put rules and regs in place that will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2138)|
| 0:35:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| So I kind of hear you, Mike, saying that, you know, it's my legacy, it's my grandkids, it's what we leave people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| And I hear you also say, and I don't want to put words in your mouth so correct me because I want to be accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| that as this legislative body, you feel you have opportunity to help correct some of that so that we can still develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| but in a proper way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| Is that right on target?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| Somebody else hop in with, yeah, Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| It's important to me because it's so important to all the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| And I realized that after we got into it and came up on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| I went to some of the meetings Tony and Joe had, four or five of them around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| And some of them were fairly well attended, many were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| But there was a couple of very vocal people that attended all of them, one in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2192)|
| 0:36:39| and it was Tony had to have security called in and so forth a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| Well, I won't get into the dispute he had with the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| That's beside the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| But as it, and I thought at that point, I don't know when those were, say a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| I thought, well, this will move right through county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| and we will adopt these land uses, these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| You can drive around our city as you cross coming in from Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| to Loudoun County to Knox County line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| You look up on the left, you can see how a hill has been just massacred out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| And we're debating whether to, a gentleman wants to correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| And if you drive all over Knoxville and Knox County, you can see runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| Kind of 40 coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| 40, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| I'm coming in from Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| As you're leaving Watt Road, look up there and you'll see how not to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| although it is hopefully going to get resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| Lots of other examples around town of water runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| And we get calls all the time after every big rain development up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| people live here and they flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| Water flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| Water flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| A building collapses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| Yeah, a building collapses and we have a stormwater department who's overworked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| But after we got into it and it came to a head, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| a much more public focus, public attention focused on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| as was mentioned, the other side of the story started to be told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| and mistold and misinterpreted and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| And interpreted, I should say, by people who would be more in the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| side, so to speak, or more, as was mentioned by Dr. Briggs, the property owner side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| And I heard from dozens of people when this vote came up that said, look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| that property's been in my family for 100 years or 50 years or a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| and we want to be able to develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| And so we heard that old don't tread on me, you know, it's my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| I'm going to do what I want to with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| That was an element of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| The development and people, the people who, not just developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| but people who sell two-by-fours and sheet rock and plywood, cement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| the building industry said, look, look how hard it is to build right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| We're at 10% capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| This would make it even more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| What are you trying to do to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| We're in the worst economy in 70 years, so look what you're trying to do to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| So that dichotomy sort of arose and presented itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| And, you know, as always, we were in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| Do we vote to, do we vote this through or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| And so that's sort of the dilemma that we found ourselves in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2357)|
| 0:39:23| And for you, so it comes back to you at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| With all that stuff that's gone on, for you specifically, why is this so important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2367)|
| 0:39:33| I mean, it's important because I want to protect our environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| and protect this beautiful place we live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| but I also do not want to prohibit commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| I don't want to have people laid off and not have jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| and not have the opportunity to do something with their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| that they plan to do for 100 years or that the families plan to do for 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| And we were in the catch-22, if that's the right term, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| that Dr. Briggs mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| I hate to throw the whole baby out with the bathwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| but that's what we were told, you know, an up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| It's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| It just needs some tweaking, particularly the ridge top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| In my opinion, the ridge top certainly needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| Those things have been abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| There's one half a mile from my house up above, and it's just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| I would like to live on a ridge top, but it's so detrimental to our environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| But that's in a minute and 30-second nutshell the dilemma that I found myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2430)|
| 0:40:37| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| So what I hear you saying is you want to protect the environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| you want to develop business, and you're feeling caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| I mean, is that what I hear you saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| Well, sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| I mean, that's what we're elected and paid to do is to be caught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| and make the tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| And this is one that, you know, we have sort of made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| but we hopefully will be making again in a more positive environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| Fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| Thank you, Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| Somebody else real quick to hop in and kind of tell me what's important to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| I'll just real quickly say something about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| and I don't want to repeat everything that they said because I agree with them completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| And, you know, we've got to do things to protect the runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| because it's caused a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| We can't have these disastrous landslides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| We actually had a colleague of mine that worked at Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| who got caught in one of these things and lost both of his legs in his apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| That can't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| To me, the gray areas are the green areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| and that's where we're not harming other people, we're not runoff issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| There's just the issue, should we just leave something green for the sake of being green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| I think that's the debatable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| But, you know, I think there's a bigger issue that goes beyond just this slopes and hilltop protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2501)|
| 0:41:48| in that the atmosphere here had become very hostile and poisoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| And as we go forward in the community, if we really want to accomplish what I think everyone does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| which is to have responsible development but yet protect the treasures that we're the stewards of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| we're going to have to have cooperation between both the developmental, the property rights people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| and also those that want to protect all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| And the atmosphere had become so poisoned with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| that there was no way that it was going to continue in a positive faction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| And we've had that on other issues here in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| We recently had our budget hearings that got very controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| We've had it on how we're going to deal with the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| And I think if we can resolve this the way that I would hope we can resolve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| in the end maybe everybody doesn't get what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| But both sides, we've done all those things, what everyone really wants to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| even the responsible developers don't want these disasters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| But we have to come up with something that we're satisfying all those things that everyone wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| and do it in a cooperative manner because otherwise it's not going to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| if it becomes confrontational and hostile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| And what I hear you saying is that there's just been a pattern of hostility starting to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| It seems pretty competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| It had gotten pretty hostile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| And, you know, I think if we would have either passed it or with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| there would have been a lot of bad feelings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| If we would have accepted it without people feeling that they had their fair say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| it was just, in my opinion, it was just not going to go in the right direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| and accomplish what we really want to accomplish in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| And did I hear you saying, I don't want to put words in your mouth, Doctor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| but did I hear you say maybe this could be a model for how we treat each other down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| Or maybe a mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| I'm not sure we've always done things right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| And we've had problems, you know, dealing with the homeless situation here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| what to do about it, you know, how we're going to allocate our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| And we probably need to go, just when we approach problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| maybe than rather doing it the right way after there's things have all sort of fallen apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| as doing it the right way to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| And it does seem that we've developed in our cultures a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| You know, you can do here, you can go northeast to Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| We've developed a fairly competitive culture right now, haven't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| And so it would be fabulous if we can find a mechanism for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| find a way to deal with this that would have a bigger impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| And I tell you, part of it is, you know, just I think like Pogo said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| you know, we've seen the enemy and he is us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| And there was an effort to make this an inclusive process to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| Apathy is probably the root here as we had all these hearings, not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| some of these issues that should have been settled back then weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| It wasn't until the final plan was out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| And then a lot of the opposition came up to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| and we were put in a position where we had to either vote it up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| and we couldn't make the changes at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| When the opportunity was there to make it, there was silence and apathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| And so now we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| And now we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| One final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Let's sneak back in, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| I think that you could safely say that 75% of the controversy over this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| was caused by the spreading of misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| So you proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| About what was in the plan and what it would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| Whether you're pro or anti, this group picked up one thing they didn't like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| and they made a martyr out of that one particular thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| So misinformation was the cause of 75% of the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| It's hard to believe that people disseminate misinformation to get their way in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| It's just unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| And I don't mean to make light of that, but you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| And it is in every kind of public debate I've ever been in, that is a common theme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| And I don't know, and I don't want to go too far afield right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| but I don't know if it's sometimes people do it out of a desire to manipulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| Other times people do it because they just don't have all the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| or they jump to conclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| Those things go on, and we understand that, and I appreciate that input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| Real quick, going back to I think we have Dave and Tony left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| Dave, why is this important to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| That's the question I want to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| The most important thing about it is it's been brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2768)|
| 0:46:15| Over and over, I guess, when I go to public meetings or the Ruatan Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| or the senior citizens or wherever I go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| the first words I want to make sure I say is that I need to know how you feel about something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2783)|
| 0:46:31| because I view it as my task, the district that I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| It's not my idea that's going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| It's how people feel about what's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| That's what I'll support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| In this particular subject, it's just the way it's turned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| I hope that I can do that every time something comes up to be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2811)|
| 0:47:01| It's not what I want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| It's not what I think I've collected the data on that people would like to see the end result of my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2824)|
| 0:47:11| So what I hear you saying, what's really important to you is you adequately represent the desires of your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2831)|
| 0:47:17| Most certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| As all these folks know, this is the issue of hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| and probably water quality have been an issue for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| sort of a lifelong professional interest from my years as a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2855)|
| 0:47:41| So strangely enough, I had the opportunity to bring this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2861)|
| 0:47:48| And so from a legislative standpoint, it's something to me I feel should have been addressed 100 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2868)|
| 0:48:01| and was actually in some documents about how we're to develop and what do we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| what is our vision for our community, this hilly place where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| People long ago noticed that we need to be concerned about what we do and how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2895)|
| 0:48:22| And so I see it's hugely important from an economic standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2902)|
| 0:48:30| and what we develop from this point on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| how we develop these hillsides is going to dramatically affect Knoxville and Knox County in the next 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2914)|
| 0:48:43| And I can see people saying, hey, those guys were pretty wise to adopt policies that they saw were necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2923)|
| 0:48:56| from the obvious damage and obvious negative effects that have been going on in the previous 50 years to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2936)|
| 0:49:06| So we've all got eyes to see, and that's all it takes to see what's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| So what are you saying? It's a legacy discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| 100 years from now, you want to be viewed as doing a thing that protected the water and the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| and economic development of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| Exactly. And I think those are all related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| I think you do not have economic prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2966)|
| 0:49:33| You just cannot have it unless you have a compatible relationship with the land and what it provides for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2973)|
| 0:49:41| Right. I appreciate that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| Mike, do you want to add to this? Why is it so important to you at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| Well, I think that there's, as has been stated, a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| First of all, the beauty of where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| And that is I like driving down the roads and looking at the scenic areas that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| I enjoy hiking. I enjoy canoeing and all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| I enjoy the natural beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| And so I want to preserve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| But in driving down the road, because I like a view, does that mean that the person who owns that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| should not have an opportunity to develop that if they so choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| So property rights is an issue with me here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| I just bought eight acres in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| It scares me to death that my neighbor might sell and there's a development going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| I've told him, sell me your land if you decide to sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| because I like the idea of maintaining my natural resources around me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| So I get that argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| But the other argument, too, is that people need jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| And if you don't think jobs are important, ask somebody who doesn't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| And when you look at the development that we have in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| and I represented the 5th District for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| the Farragut area, I mean, it was a boom town, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| So now it's moved out to the Carnes Powell area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| It's going to be moving into Gibbs Court and it's going to be moving to South Knoxville where I'm at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| So as it moves, I want to see responsible development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| I want to have everybody brought to the table so that we can have the carpenters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| and the electricians and the plumbers and the people who need these jobs through this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3063)|
| 0:51:09| We can see that in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| And so on the one hand, yes, I want to see a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| I think we can do it and I think we're smart enough in our community to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| and come to the table and figure this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| Sevier County has addressed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Blount County is addressing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| I mean, a lot of communities are addressing this very thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| I just talked to some folks who are involved in Lexington, Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| So this is nothing new to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| And I think that we're in a situation where we can do something positive and productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| And I think that by bringing the parties together, I think we can reach the goal where maybe not everybody is happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3096)|
| 0:51:43| and not everybody is going to leave the table happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| but I think that we can have a good document that's going to serve us not only now but years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| So what I hear you saying, one of the things that's important to you is that we bring everybody to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| or the key players to the table and be able to find something that may not be everything everybody is looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| but gives you a place to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| Is that kind of what I heard you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| I'm going to do the same thing over here with the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| Now, some of this is not new to me because some of the commission work has been voted on and been up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3127)|
| 0:52:13| I don't know quite as much, you know, where the council is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| Now, I don't want to rehash everything that's happened but doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| I might just go down the line this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| There's one more commissioner, Smith, down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| On the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| Oh, you snuck in, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| See, I'm not bright enough to be able to manage multiple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| So help me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| What's your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| Larry Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| As a member of the commission, would you tell me why it's important to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| Well, first of all, you know, I can take from every one of my colleagues over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| I can relate with just about everyone with what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| They've all got good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| But my concern is that, you know, Steve, I represent about 45,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| I want to make the right vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| I want to make an educated vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| So I always want to try to look and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| My background is, and I'm a little bit like Tony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| Tony has spent 30 years probably teaching science and things at his school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| and has done a great job and has won awards doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| I've got a degree in wildlife management and fisheries from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| I spent two years with TVA in the fisheries division and four years with TWRA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3191)|
| 0:53:18| in stock personnel orders at Teleco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| So I know what it is to be with streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| And I also know, you know, and I like development for both of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| But when I see, Marilyn, I'm going to borrow this in a minute, Marilyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| But when I see things like this, we've got, oh, here's a picture of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| with all this exposed, well, the guy hadn't finished his project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| You know, let the person finish their project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| and then let's see what items that we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| And if there's something wrong, yeah, we have things in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| I just don't think that we're enforcing the laws that we do have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| And, you know, that's what I'm going to be doing all week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| I'm going to be working in streams this weekend myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| And I know that streams can, 24 hours, 48 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| it certainly won't depend on how fast they go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| but they can rebound pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| Some of them, their sedimentation picks up, and, you know, you have to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3246)|
| 0:54:12| So I just think, you know, I'm here to make an educated vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| but I'm also, I can see from both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| from the developer's side and from the ecologist's side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| as to, you know, what's, straighten out the facts from fiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| So what I hear you say also, Larry, that's somewhat different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| from what I've heard before is that you're also interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| in making sure we have all the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| And that you can make an educated vote that is good for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| obviously you're pro-fishery, but good for business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| and it's not just swinging one way or the other based upon emotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| Is that what I hear is important to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| And like what Tony said, you know, we want to be able to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| when we look back 50 years from now, hey, did we make that right decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| You want a legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| It's interesting how often that comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| We want to leave a legacy for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| We've got quite a legacy already, don't we, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| Even more one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| Thanks, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| I'm going to switch over now, you know, to the Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| and start with Marilyn and just work down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| Marilyn, why is this important to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| You know, I think a lot has been said by my colleagues on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| and, fortunately, I think we talked about the ground rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| I think we share a lot of – there's a lot of commonalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| in terms of why this is important to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| I think Commissioner Norman's point that it's a legacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| that we all want to make decisions that are good not only now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| but in the future is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| I think Commissioner Hammond's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| property rights are very dear to folks in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| We're a cantankerous, independent, suburban sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| And on a very base level, the personality of the peoples of this region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| don't like being told what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| And I think that's an emotion that has been stirred in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| And so, you know, trying to balance our responsibility to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3346)|
| 0:55:52| in the long range with the reality of emotions in the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| I was reared in West Texas, out there in Midland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| So I kind of get that independent sort, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| And so this does feel in some ways like home to me with people saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| are you telling me what to do, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| And we run into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| But I hear saying what's important to you is much what they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| leave a legacy but respect people's rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| Did I hear you saying that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| And finding a way to do that and finding that balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| Nick, you want to add to that or what's important to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| I may just say, and me too to the general discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| I think the objective of probably everyone is to try to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| I don't think anyone here is fighting a battle if they're fighting one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| in order just to, you know, to bar something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| And I think Dr. Briggs brought up an interesting point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| and that was this up or down decision making seemed to really go against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| the legislative grain that you have where you're trying to resolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| and meld different interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| and to not be able to tweak something seems a little bit unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| My interests are, of course, I think like everyone else has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| that is we have the scenic beauty of this area that's very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| and we also have the need for jobs and development and activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| But in the 4th District, which I represent, the city's 4th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| not the county's, but it's the northeast quadrant of this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| there are hillsides and we have situations where there's flooding on the First Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3441)|
| 0:57:30| And the flooding comes in part from developing maybe where we shouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| and whether that's on stream banks or on hillsides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| but there are consequences to every time we take another piece of farmland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| and turn it into something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| Now, you know, if you're a developer, you're trying to get your job done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| and make some money and make homes for people or whatever you're doing, commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| But there are consequences that flow back to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| whether it's schools, roads, or normal infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| or whether it's things like flooding that becomes very, very expensive to try to undo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| Once the land has been changed, there's more runoff, there's more problems downstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| and there's only so much capacity in those natural streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| So I think we're all mindful that we have to have some regulatory scheme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| The question is, how far do we go before we start stepping on toes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| People bought their property, they expect government to protect their property interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| not to take it away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| And we all hear people say things like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| if you think that should be a park, then you buy it with your money and pay me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3514)|
| 0:58:40| but don't you tell me that you're going to regulate me out of using my land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| There's a real battleground, and I don't know that it's related either to Tennessee or Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| It's kind of a battleground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| If you want a park and a greenway and whatnot and you want to do it on my land, sorry, this is my land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| I'm going to do what I want with it, obviously within reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| And we're trying to bring that reasonable boundary into the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| There has to be some tradeoffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| What I hear you saying, that last phrase, within reason, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| And you're saying with that, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| You come back to say, you know, this is my land, you're going to mess with my land, and there's all those extremes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| And you're saying, I want to balance that from what I hear you saying with the damage done by runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3556)|
| 0:59:21| because, you know, if you do what you want to with your land and it damages somebody else's land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| and all those within reason become, and that's what's important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| is finding a way to manage that within reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| I think it's looking at the problem, trying to find a reasonable solution that protects our scenic values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3571)|
| 0:59:38| our property values, including not flooding, and the idea of individual land ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| That's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| Charles, do you want to add what's important to you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| And, first of all, I want to compliment you on the way you're running this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| And I think all the comments are very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| I'm hearing a lot of different angles that I think need to be expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| And to follow up a little bit on Commissioner Briggs' comment, just to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| I know this is not a conflict between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| Oh, absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| But we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| Yes, clarification is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3609)|
| 1:00:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| And then the other thing about the contention-ness of this maybe earlier, so far I haven't been exposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| The people who have called me, no matter what their views were, have been very polite to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| You know, we've discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| If they thought that I was taking a position here or there, they were still very polite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| So I hope we can keep that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| And, you know, any constituents that have input to any of us, I hope that they approach us in that manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| because there's no doubt in my mind from what I'm hearing from everybody here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| we're all willing to listen and we're all sincere about trying to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| And about that contention, I used to do work in a store in sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| I could have 25 people be kind to me and then one person blow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| And that just kind of got me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| And I think it's not about Tony or anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| I think we remember the negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| And so, you know, I am sure the large majority of people you deal with are very kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| But it doesn't take many being really harsh that makes us remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| And so that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| Anything else you want to say that's important to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| I represent the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| And so there's been a lot of flooding, of course, to state the obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| And my district has probably gotten hit at least as bad as any other district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| The vast majority of calls that I've gotten since I've been on city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| has been about the flooding and about the storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| And you have people calling you up whose homes have been flooding, their property is damaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| their insurance may not cover it, the city can't help them, they go to FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3700)|
| 1:01:45| And so, you know, I'm trying to struggle with how do you prevent that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3705)|
| 1:01:52| Some homes were probably built where they shouldn't have been built to begin with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| as far as just kind of the way flooding occurs and the way natural water flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3717)|
| 1:02:04| I understand completely the arguments about property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| You know, I'm a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| I want to be able to do what I want to be able to do with my property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| But the focus basically has been on people's property to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3734)|
| 1:02:20| And what I'm hearing is people who are downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| A lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| I'm hearing from both, but mainly from people who are downstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| who are suffering from these storms we've been having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3747)|
| 1:02:33| Now, not all of it is related to development, I know, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| But it seems like, you know, we used to say a hundred-year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| It seems like we're having a hundred-year flood about every five years now or less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| and that these kind of storms are more the norm than a fluke than they used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| So I think we have to start thinking in terms of how we can build more responsibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3770)|
| 1:02:58| and more sustainably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| And I also want to explore with my colleagues the economic impact of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3780)|
| 1:03:08| because restrictions and good development don't necessarily impede economic progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3788)|
| 1:03:17| And cities who have built greener| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| and who have built with a thoughtfulness of kind of the overall sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3799)|
| 1:03:28| have actually improved in their economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| And so sometimes I think that there's kind of an automatic perceived conflict that may not be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3811)|
| 1:03:40| That, you know, development is going to make you money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| Environmental stuff is not going to make you money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| And I want to explore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| It's a complicated issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| But my mind is completely open to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| So I hear you say a few things that are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| What's interesting to you is property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| but it's also the property rights of the people you represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| And you're saying, yeah, yeah, there's property rights of those who develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| but there's also property rights of the people who are being affected by development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| Am I putting words in your mouth, or is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| No, that's exactly it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| And then also the identity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| Boy, it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| We tend to be either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| I don't know what it is about us, but it's either good or bad, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| And you're saying I would like to explore a way to find ways that we can find that development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3857)|
| 1:04:23| you know, management and development can live together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| Sure, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| And, you know, we all want jobs and we all want the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| I don't think anybody wants to starve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| And I guess what I'm looking for is a way where we can do both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| because they're not necessarily in conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| They're not necessarily in conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| Brenda, they may have said everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| You know, the tough part for you and Joe is you're at the end of the row here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| But tell me, what's important to you that might give me some insight just real quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| Okay, Joe, I'll leave you a morsel or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| I represent the third district and it's adjacent to the fifth, and we have problems with flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| We have some examples in the third of excellent planning and development of hillsides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| and we have some that are just atrocious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| And I would not like to see the atrocious ones occur again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| I think that we need to be looking at this as a balance between property rights and responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3911)|
| 1:05:18| environmental right and environmental responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| And it should not be an either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| And we so often want to make this an either or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| and I think Commissioner Briggs made some strong points at the beginning that this has become an either or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3928)|
| 1:05:34| and I don't think that that's something that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| We don't need to be polarized in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| I chose to live here because I think this is one of the most beautiful places in the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| and I want to preserve that beauty for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| We've heard a lot about jobs, and right now our economy is not at its strong point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3947)|
| 1:05:52| and so jobs are a really crucial thing to a number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| I also know that as we look at how we're going to develop the land or not develop it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3955)|
| 1:06:01| we need to think about jobs 50, 60, 100 years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| So a plan that we might think looks attractive now is not the kind of legacy I think we want to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3966)|
| 1:06:15| because we need to think about the economic development along with the environmental legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| So I think that's a piece that we're all in a position of having to weigh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| I feel sorry for the commissioners because I think since they were up to that first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| they really got the brunt of a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| They caught the brunt of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| Right, and we caught the tailwind, is that pretty much it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| They look like pretty tough bunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| We're glad they got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| Yeah, you know, I feel really sorry for them, but, you know, hey, they got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=3997)|
| 1:06:43| They know I'm sympathetic, but that's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| It's got to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| Once again, I don't think that this is a thing that is an either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| I don't think it needs to be polarizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| And I think we do need to look at the economic impact down the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| And I think, as Councilman Thomas said, sustainability and sound decisions are very enduring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4018)|
| 1:07:08| What I hear you saying is you want to look for economic responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| and environmental responsibility rather than economics against environmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| Is that what's important to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| Joe, you want to add to the kind of put the cap on this discussion there for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| What's important to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Well, it's important to me because it's really important to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| and our natural beauty and our natural resources are what we're all about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4047)|
| 1:07:34| the ridgetops, the mountains, and that's what people come here for, and that's what we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| So we want to preserve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| And we can't go back, and there's been bad development and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| So we recognize this, and we want to try to preserve our natural beauty going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4064)|
| 1:07:50| And having said that, we also understand that people have property rights and people have rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4070)|
| 1:07:56| So what we're trying to do is figure out a way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| find a way through this plan that we can preserve people's property rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4079)|
| 1:08:05| and at the same time preserve our natural scenery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| Isn't it interesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| You probably knew this, but you know what jumped out at me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| How similar everything sounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| You know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| Something I want to just throw in here, and you may experience this while you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| They talked about some of the districts there, the flooding and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| and on property in that area, on some commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| What I've noticed, the city at one time used to clean the creeks out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| I'm talking a creek is as wide as from here to the other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| You've got big trees in these creeks now going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| And so when it rains, and I just noticed this a couple of weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| as I come in different intersections, you look on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| and you're looking at First Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| My goodness, you can't see the creek for the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| So people, every time it rains, well, there's that ridgetop flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| Well, maybe and maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| I just, you know, if those were cleared out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| if we can get back to that program and clean the creeks out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| and so that water, like you said, get that water on out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| then let's see if we still have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| And you make a point that I want to get to here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| but I want to come back to that, Larry, because I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| And you're really testing me here, Larry, sitting away from your name tag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| because I don't remember watching that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| Next week, I'm going to be up in the balcony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| But everyone here said pretty much the same thing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| in different ways, different, but you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| Economic development is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| I want a legal legacy for my kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| I want clean water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| I want economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| And then I heard almost everybody say somewhere we got off track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| and this became a battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| Somewhere along the line, this became pretty competitive and pretty rough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| And so what we want to do, hearing what's important to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| what excites me, because I've sat in one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| I mean, I did one with this oil company, and it's about something called fracking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| where they push water down and it ruins the groundwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| That was the most contentious discussion I've seen in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| And people were on this end and this end and attacking one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| And what I was looking for, number one, I want to know what's important to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| because what we want to do is meet yours and community's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| But I also want to see how competitive you were with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| And I know that there's more to it, and you're being nice and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| but I honestly believe we've got a lot of really good common ground that we can get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| With that in mind, because I know I have limited time and I've got to check my watch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4228)|
| 1:10:34| there's a couple things that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| One of those is what Larry brought up about the idea of more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| One of my jobs here is to make sure that we get accurate information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4242)|
| 1:10:48| I've heard people say to me, you know, we already got the laws on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4248)|
| 1:10:56| If we just enforce those, we wouldn't have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| Then I've heard other people say, no, that's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| Those laws are fine, but they're not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| Now, one of our jobs is to get that factual information out there for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| And that's one of the things we're going to commit to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| We're going to kind of find out about the creek cleaning, how that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| We're going to find out what laws are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| We're going to find a way to kind of lay that out in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| We may put up here graphically for you to see what's being done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| what kind of enforcement's involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| We're going to put up the creeks or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| We want to get all the information we can in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| Here's what we don't want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| We don't want to spend this meeting debating factual information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| Because we get factual information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| I mean, that's just looking it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| So we have a limited amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| So if it's all right with you in terms of process, in between meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| we'll gather the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| We'll get them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| We may e-mail them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| We may put them on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| I don't know how we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| But if you have a question about factual information, be sure and let me know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| and you guys, and we're going to make sure we get the facts right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| Because what I find out in these meetings is you're really bright people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| and we don't want to spend our time chasing facts that we can easily get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| and just hand out, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| So if you have a question about something you're not sure the fact's on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| please let me and others know and we will get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| Because I find that if we can get the facts clear, it doesn't always –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| facts don't resolve this, but the lack of facts can gum it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| if that makes any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| And I really don't want to spend an evening of somebody saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| well, the current laws will do it, and somebody else saying, no, they won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| We'll just check the laws, get it out, discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| and then talk about what's behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| Steve, if I can jump in for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| Please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| I would like to add one thought, and that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| if there is a conflict between the city and the county approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| and I don't know that there is, but it is somewhat based on the proposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| that water flows downhill, and the county surrounds the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| and all that area has more undeveloped land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| and that water flows through creeks and streams to the city and to the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4389)|
| 1:13:14| and so where there's flooding, to some degree, we're on the receiving end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| And I don't mean to say that that's isolated and only we and not they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| but there is that aspect that there's going to be more development spread out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| in the county than there is in the city, which has kind of grown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| It's the nature of the beast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| You can't have more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| The county is going to be your development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| From what I can tell, your development is going to be in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| and you're right, it seems the city is on the receiving end of the floodwaters, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| And so what I want to say is we're going to do the homework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| and we're going to put the information so if Larry says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| if we just clean those creeks, I'll take care of it, we'll look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| And if somebody says we've already got laws in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| my response is, really, let's look them up, let's see what they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| and see how they're being enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| And then we will check all that so that while we're here we can focus on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| And we're willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| That's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| I'm going to ask for your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| I'm going to definitely be checking with the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| I'm going to be talking to the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| I'm going to be talking to the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| I mean, this is not you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| It's the city trying to find out what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| I don't even think it's the developers versus the environmentalists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| I mean, I know it feels that way, but it could be people who want to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| and people who want to deal with the environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| have just not found a way to do that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| And that's what we want to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| Now, there's one really specific issue that we've got to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| It's a process issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| And I don't know how else to have this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| I've thought about what are different ways to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| What do you want to accomplish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| How do you want to get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| There's two ways to go about it that I know of that we've worked before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| Both of them work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| It depends on what you guys want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| In other words, my understanding is when we get to September 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| we'd like to be able to get to a place that you guys could come to agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| amend, or do what you need to with this piece of policy and regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| so you can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| Is that your understanding of what we're trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| Well, based on what they brought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| when they brought the document to us and the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| it's not an amendable document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| Whatever we decide on, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| is going to have to be totally put down and rewritten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| Right, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4542)|
| 1:15:51| Mark Donaldson with the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| State law is structured so that authority to adopt an amendment to the regional plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4553)|
| 1:15:59| is given to the Planning Commission with the ability by the legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4559)|
| 1:16:08| to make that operative, basically to ratify that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4568)|
| 1:16:13| The Planning Commission adopted a version of the task force's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| They made some amendments to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| The County Commission has elected not to make that operative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| That same law provides the legislative body the authority to initiate a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4584)|
| 1:16:31| So you could, in fact, turn around, take that document as a starting point, amend it any which way you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4591)|
| 1:16:39| submit it, initiate it as your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| It goes to the Planning Commission for a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| and then comes back to the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| That's not the option we were given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| The plan that you had in front of you was the version adopted by the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4611)|
| 1:16:56| so you had to either ratify that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| But that's only step one of what could be another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| We could be the initiator, in essence, and send it back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| So thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| And, again, that's one of those fact things that we're going to check, make sure we do right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| But my understanding, on the back side, by September 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| you would like to have either a new plan or amended plan, whatever the facts require you to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| so that you guys can put this thing to bed and move forward if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| What I believe will happen, from the little bit I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| is there are certain points of leverage or sticking points that are going to be kind of where we have conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4653)|
| 1:17:39| a lot of conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| One of those will be slope, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| I mean, everybody I talk to, slope comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| There's two ways to have the slope conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| One of them is we can bring it up, we can talk in this group about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| and list it as one of the things we want to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| And this is what some bodies do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| Then those bodies come up with two or three or four things that they think we've got to address these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| to come to agreement on before we can move over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| Then those bodies would do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| You would have the commission appoint two people and the council appoint two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| Those people, over a certain week's period, over a two-week period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| work with me to build a recommendation to bring back to the body that you guys can then debate and decide upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4695)|
| 1:18:23| That's one approach, and that can be a fairly efficient approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| If that's the approach, this is how the meetings look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| Tonight we do process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| Next week we do the meat of the work and come up with those key touch points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| that have to be leveraged and amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| During that meeting, you guys agree upon those points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| and then you will assign people over the next two weeks to meet with us and come up with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4723)|
| 1:18:49| The third meeting, we bring that back and the large group works on those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| We spend the next two weeks after that coming to amend and adapt those recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| so the fourth meeting you're able to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| That's one approach, and if that's acceptable and within your by-law structure, I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| The other approach is to bring up each one and discuss each of them per meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4749)|
| 1:19:17| That's with everybody in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| And so what that would entail is next week we come up with the two or three ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4761)|
| 1:19:27| Each one of those are brought up before the group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| and then the group will decide to discuss that each week on each topic and try to come to conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4770)|
| 1:19:38| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| Now, I'm getting a lot of work from the staff over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| which means I may be walking all over something that you guys need to do differently, and I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| That's why we have really bright people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| Steve, the issue is the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4788)|
| 1:19:51| If you have two commissioners, then that's going to have to be sunshine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| and it's going to have to be publicly noticed, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4794)|
| 1:19:58| So as long as we're working within that framework, but just within the guidelines of our Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4798)|
| 1:20:04| The Sunshine Law, which, again, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| You can actually publicly notice that and have their meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| We want to work within your structure, and that's the great thing about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| Now, what we need to know tonight, and we've got to decide tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4814)|
| 1:20:18| which of those two approaches best fits where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4818)|
| 1:20:24| Do you prefer the subcommittees have their meetings and make recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| or do you prefer each topic be discussed by the entire committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| And I'm going to really leave it back up to the two chairs to decide how we want to manage that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| because I need to know that from you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| When do you need to know it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| I'd like to know it as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| If you guys want to talk about that, at the latest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| I would need to know midweek as we prep for the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| So you can decide now, you can decide later, and inform me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| I'm good with either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| Steve, we have a meeting Monday, the full commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| and we have some commissioners that are not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| And so we actually have a luncheon on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| I'll make sure that that's on our luncheon agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| and I think we can decide on Monday and have this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| If not, we can let you know for sure by the time that meeting is over with on Monday, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| Are there any questions about what I'm proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| Does everybody kind of understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| I personally, Steve, I'm over here, I'd personally like to discuss it tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| and I don't see why we can't go ahead and make a decision tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| If the body feels that it would be better to wait until the other ones are present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| so I'm fine with that, but I'd certainly like to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| Let's go ahead and briefly talk about the strengths and the weaknesses of that model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| Then you guys, I'm going to defer to Mike that on Monday you guys can have that full discussion and let me know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4902)|
| 1:21:51| but I certainly don't mind talking about that for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| I'll kind of tell you about what I think the strengths and weaknesses are of those two models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| and then you guys can talk to me about it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| Nick, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| Your button's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| I just wanted to mention that before you got involved, in fact, or even asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| there was a question of whether we would have a subcommittee approach, a couple from council, a couple from commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| and virtually everyone said, no, let's meet, the whole bodies meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| And the reason is it's an important topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| And I think that no one has the perfect answer, but collectively the information will be on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4940)|
| 1:22:26| and discussing it tends to air it all out, and hopefully at that point the public at least has a basis to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4946)|
| 1:22:33| well, they're doing the right thing or they're crazy, let's get rid of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| But at least it's out in the open, and I think that's the value of a continued group discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| I think that's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| One thing I wouldn't want, I know that sometimes people say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| should we add other people to these subcommittees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| At this point, I think we're coming down to you guys being able to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| So let's talk about the idea of the large group discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| Nick described the strength of that large group discussion, which we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| It can all be aired, and everybody has their say, and they have their moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| The weakness of the large group discussion, it's a slower process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| The only, you know, I guess caveat I would have on this is a lot of the issues about why the plan would need to be modified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4988)|
| 1:23:18| are technical, that we just about need to have some of the, and really some of the developers can't even answer it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=4998)|
| 1:23:24| but the developers, engineers can answer it about why you can build on this type of slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| or why this harms the environment or what problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| I think as long as we're dealing with the responsible developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| and they all can't come down here and say this because a lot of the problems have been, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5017)|
| 1:23:42| just bad development, bad developers who really didn't have an interest in preventing some of the problems that we've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5022)|
| 1:23:49| But some of these really and truly are technical issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| You know, particularly at the lower, I've talked to some developers that, quite frankly, say over a 25 percent grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5032)|
| 1:23:58| they don't really have a lot of problems because it's just too tough to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| And a lot of this seems to be with the 15 to 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5043)|
| 1:24:09| I know there's been some on the 15 to 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| You can sort of pick the number where you draw the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| but you almost need to have, you know, technical people to tell us what can be done and what cannot be done safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5054)|
| 1:24:21| And so it's hard, at least for me, to deliberate on those because I just don't have the engineering background to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5061)|
| 1:24:28| And that takes us back to the factual information point again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| One of the things we do with factual information is bring expertise to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| And so as we work on this, and I hear from somebody, you know, we need to know the technical aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5075)|
| 1:24:41| Then what we've got to do is bring somebody to the table who can give that to you in language you understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| I mean, I'm not an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| I'm reading through this sometimes and I'm thinking, okay, I've got to find somebody in the engineering department to explain to me what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| And that's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| And by the way, that can be done in large group or in small group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| And I'm not advocating one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| You decide that there are two approaches, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| And let me real quick, Mike, I'm going to turn back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| So the large group approach affects a lot of what Nick said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| So what we get here in the large group approach is kind of sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| Everybody gets it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| Everybody gets the same information as they get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| We're all moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| We're having that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| The downside of that, it takes longer, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| And I can't guarantee you by September 1 and four meetings we've done all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| Now, I'm not against going further and having longer conversations with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| but you've got to know, you know, that that's a more extended process when everybody's involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| The upside of the subcommittee is it expedites the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5139)|
| 1:25:45| In other words, they tend to be able to bring somebody in and come recommendations and come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| and you may move more efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| Now, I don't say effectively, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| There's a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5154)|
| 1:25:55| You move more efficiently with your subcommittees bringing recommendations back in terms of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5155)|
| 1:26:00| The downside of that is, of course, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| We've had subcommittees, and they bring stuff in, and we need to talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| and is it really moving us forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| And so those are the two kinds of things you've got to think about in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| I'm going to go to Mike and back over here to Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| Mike, do you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5177)|
| 1:26:18| I'd just like to put in a plug also for having it all here at one time for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5178)|
| 1:26:27| Both Nick and Dr. Briggs both have brought up some good reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| but also you have two sides, you know, the antis and the pros.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| It's easier when everybody is on the same playing field rather than trying to play a ball game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5195)|
| 1:26:43| One here and one in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| One inning here and one there, or half an inning here and half there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| But if everybody is here, they're going to have another chance to bring this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5209)|
| 1:26:54| And the bottom line on all of it is there's maybe four major sticky points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5214)|
| 1:27:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| That if the proper information is disseminated and explained fully how it works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5222)|
| 1:27:10| it's going to eliminate a lot of the opposition because, as I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5230)|
| 1:27:16| they were told wrong in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| But if we get past those four things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| So what I hear you saying, Mike, is that you like the idea of getting that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| Everybody hearing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| Same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| Not sitting, assuming what other people are doing and that's important to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| I also hear you say that, you know, if the information is correct, a lot of this goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| And that may be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| Now, sometimes these situations that's not necessarily true because other times people have interests that are disconnected with information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| But we on the front end want to make sure we get the right information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| I mean, you know, we don't want to make a decision without all the information no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5266)|
| 1:27:50| But we need to justify the decision we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| But then you want to use that decision based upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| So I'm hearing you say you like, even if it takes a little bit longer, might be a meeting or two longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5275)|
| 1:28:00| whatever it takes to get us there, you're willing to go down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| I hear you saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| I'm going to go back here to Larry and then back over to Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| Then I'm going to kind of tie that discussion up and leave it to the chairs to manage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| Steve, in your process of what you're wanting to do, what about public input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| Are you going to – I know we've got the expert like Dr. Bridges talking about that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| Are you having time at the end of all this, end of every week, or at the end of the whole process to have public input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| We plan to have public input tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| And I plan to work with the chairs because it's important that there be public input consistently throughout the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5308)|
| 1:28:34| So what we want is we want to have accurate information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| Let me tell you what else I'm going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| I'm going to work really hard to be talking to as many of you who want to talk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| And I want to connect with the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| I want to talk to the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| I want to talk to people who have interest within this community so we learn as much as we can about making this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5327)|
| 1:28:53| On top of that, I think it's important on a regular basis that public comment be able to be made here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5333)|
| 1:28:58| What we don't want to do is leave the impression somehow we're cutting people out of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5338)|
| 1:29:04| I think that is damaging to my credibility and damaging to you guys being able to make a good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5344)|
| 1:29:10| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5350)|
| 1:29:11| Now, here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5351)|
| 1:29:12| Here's what I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| You could put it on a billboard, and you could send it over the Internet, and you could call everybody in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5354)|
| 1:29:20| and you could go to their house and tell them it's happening, and somebody's going to say, I had no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5360)|
| 1:29:25| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| All you can control is process that's a point of integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5369)|
| 1:29:35| You can't control how they react to your process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| You can't own something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| If somebody wants to cause a problem, you can't own it for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| We just want to make sure we treat them right, we have good process, people have opportunity, and it's a good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5386)|
| 1:29:53| And this is what I'm guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| You guys are used to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| No matter what you decide, somebody's going to be unhappy with you, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| So let's just make sure we did a good process when we did it, and then we can all sleep at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5400)|
| 1:30:06| Tony, last comment on this before we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| I'd certainly speak for the, you know, the full body discussion process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5408)|
| 1:30:14| Certainly with the commission taking it up formally in that discussion, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5414)|
| 1:30:22| we have a range of positions on the plan from, you know, me on one side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5422)|
| 1:30:29| and then all the way through, probably with the six, five votes, we have extremes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5429)|
| 1:30:33| probably in terms of pro and anti the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| So it would be difficult, I think, to do the subcommittee, like, how are you going to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| without having one of these extremes on the subcommittee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| And there is somewhat of a poisoned atmosphere also from misinformation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5446)|
| 1:30:54| and so we're fighting against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| There's people that are on these bodies, I think, that have taken in the poison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5457)|
| 1:31:03| and they are disseminating the same position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| But I'm not, you know, I'm just saying there is polarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| There's polarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| There's polarity, and for that reason, this total group thing would probably work better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| We're probably going to use the word poison a lot more, especially for environmentalists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| But anyway, the idea of polarity of position is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| I will say this, when you've got a big polarity of position, a lot of disagreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| people tend toward, using y'all's phraseology, more sunshine rather than less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| So here's what I want you to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| Remember, I'm facilitating, you're deciding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| Man, everybody's just touching buttons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| I'm going to come back over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5502)|
| 1:31:43| I'll let you guys have a chance, and then we'll kind of move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| Brenda, then Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5508)|
| 1:31:49| When we had our initial meeting of the full commission and the full council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| we talked about subcommittees and committee of the whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| and I left that night with the clear understanding that we voted to have a committee of the whole hear things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5518)|
| 1:32:05| And while I understand that does take longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| I also understand that the same words go into everyone's ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5528)|
| 1:32:14| They may not always hear the same thing or have the same intonation, but I think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5534)|
| 1:32:22| You want that sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5542)|
| 1:32:23| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5543)|
| 1:32:24| And, you know, it's fun for me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| You know, I'm good with either approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5549)|
| 1:32:30| Charles, want to add anything else to that comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| Not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5553)|
| 1:32:34| I just wanted to speak in favor of the full body approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| I think it's just important that everybody hears everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| and any of the suspicion that lingers out there, we know we're all hearing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5559)|
| 1:32:44| We don't have to get it secondhand from the subcommittees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| What we're going to do is give it to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| Steve, if I could ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| Does any of the commissioners want the subcommittee plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| Well, I think we're decided on the commission side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| We'll go with the full body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| We have a light on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| Oh, I'm sorry, Marilyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5583)|
| 1:33:04| At the risk of being a dead horse, we made this decision the last time we met in a group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| and we looked at exactly the two options that you talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| and the committee of the whole was decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| I hear you saying not only am I for sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| We are decided we're for sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| You're kind of talking about the same thing over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| Is that kind of what I heard you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| Well, there was just concern about the subcommittee approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| and people not hearing the same messages and decisions being made by a smaller group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| and the decision was made very strongly last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| that everybody needed to be at the table all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5613)|
| 1:33:34| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| Well, gee, you just made that easy for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| One more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5620)|
| 1:33:41| I want to check my notes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| Steve, quick question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| You said that we may need to extend our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| You're talking about more meetings, or you're talking about making these meetings longer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| No, not more meetings probably, but it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| Usually, it's an additional meeting rather than extending the length of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| Anybody who wants to make it longer at one time, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5635)|
| 1:34:02| I'm going to check with the man back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| A two-hour meeting, Steve, is a very, very short meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| You guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| How long for council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| You know, that's why you have such great leaders up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| They can have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5658)|
| 1:34:26| I'll make sure I'm in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| In five minutes, I'm going to turn it over to you guys for public comment, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| because I think we've got a long ways to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| Several things I want to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| Let me interrupt you just a second, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| Please, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| If we are going to have public comment, and I know at one point we decided we were not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| but I appreciate what you said in terms of if you have a process that includes public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5686)|
| 1:34:53| that's important from a perceptual standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| We've always, on our side, the council side, been very adamant about public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| So if we're going to have public input, in the future we probably need to have a time frame there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5702)|
| 1:35:08| and then we need to ask for a sign-up sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| and at the beginning of the meeting ask people that would like to participate to sign up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| so then we can kind of factor in the timing and allow the appropriate amount of time to each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5715)|
| 1:35:22| depending on how many we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| And it may be, it's great to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| and it may be that you guys tonight don't want to do public because we haven't properly prepped for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5726)|
| 1:35:33| We're going to have to leave it back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| Well, it's 635, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| if we went another 10 minutes and then allowed 15 minutes for public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| we could go ahead and ask people from the audience to sign a sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| We could make one up real quick, and if we have everybody in the building who wants to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5746)|
| 1:35:51| maybe, you know, we might reconsider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| But I think that's probably, Mr. Chairman, if you agree with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| in 10 minutes we'll close it off and open it up to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| Let me ask, does anyone out there want to address this this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| Does anyone want to make any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5764)|
| 1:36:05| We have one, two, three, four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5765)|
| 1:36:11| Is that all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| Four people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| I think if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| Maybe give them three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| Three minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5775)|
| 1:36:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| I want to make sure from now on that we have a discussion up front on how to manage the public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5779)|
| 1:36:23| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5783)|

| 1:36:46| when you spoke about what's important, you spoke about legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| At some level I heard legacy from almost everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| We want to leave a place that our kids and our grandkids can be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5812)|

| 1:37:03| At the same time, you know, we've got to have business development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| We can't afford not to allow people to grow their businesses and expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5826)|
| 1:37:12| And guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| This is really not great timing in terms of economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| You know, if this discussion were had in 2005, I don't know Knoxville's economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| but it might have been an easier discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| But right now we have people who aren't even getting a lot of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| and now they're saying, hey, are you going to push me out of the work I'm getting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5848)|
| 1:37:35| And yet you're committed to finding a way, which I really appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| you seem committed as two legislative bodies of finding a way to protecting the ridgetops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| protecting the mountains, protecting the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| and at the same time working with the business community, the chamber, the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5869)|
| 1:37:54| and all the things and trying to find a way to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| And the other thing I heard from you tonight is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| All of you know that none of you are going to get everything you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5880)|
| 1:38:05| And I think it's important that this process takes place that all of us accept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| everybody in this room accept, whatever we end up, it's probably not going to be everything you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5889)|
| 1:38:17| And if we can realize that, that, you know what, if you get 80% of what you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5897)|
| 1:38:23| and you're almost already there, if we get 80% further down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| how much better are we off than we are right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5908)|
| 1:38:33| And if the people can come to a place where they can say, yes, we've reached this slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| and yes, we understand how to grade at this level, and we're going to do some things about the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| and we're going to have some structure about the greenways, and we're going to protect the ridgetops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| and we're going to do all of that in such a way that we don't run our developers out of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| and it doesn't have to be perfect, no legislation is perfect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| but you will find a place to be productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| And that's our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| What we commit to you is, number one, we're going to do our homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5938)|
| 1:39:02| We will take care of the factual issues, because it's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| You guys don't do this full-time, most of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| You don't have the technical expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| Neither do I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| We're going to find it, and we're going to disseminate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| I also believe, Mike, that just information won't resolve it, because people, they debate information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5955)|
| 1:39:22| but people also have interests that we've got to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| But we want to be accurate with our information, meet as many people's interests as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5966)|
| 1:39:31| and come to a conclusion that's best for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| That's my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| We will tend not to take a lot of time within these next meetings trying to clarify factual information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5976)|
| 1:39:42| unless it's completely necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| We'll spend most of our time working on the interest and the process on each of those topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5984)|
| 1:39:50| Next meeting, we're going to get into the meat of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| I want you to be thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| I'm going to give you some homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| I want you to be thinking about what are, I heard somebody say there's about four things hanging us up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| Did you hear somebody say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| Now, think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| I want you to think about those three or four things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| and then I also want you to then prioritize them in order of how important are they to you and your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6005)|
| 1:40:12| If those three or four things are there, you need to be writing those down and prioritizing those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6012)|
| 1:40:17| why they're important to you, and then under those priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| write down why you've listed that one, two, three, or four, and how tied you are to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6020)|
| 1:40:25| Those are important so we can have those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| Does that make any sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| And next two weeks from now when we come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| I hope to have had some good discussions with people in the community and with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6031)|
| 1:40:35| and we're going to move into the meat of those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6035)|
| 1:40:42| I am honored that we get to be a part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6042)|
| 1:40:46| I look forward to talking to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| Yes, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| I don't mean to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| Are you finished with these comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6051)|
| 1:40:55| I had one about public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| And, of course, I'm probably the person that started this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| and I might be a little hypersensitive to abuse because I've been abused publicly, privately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6067)|
| 1:41:22| and I am somewhat, and when I look into the audience right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6082)|
| 1:41:26| I'm not worried about one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| I know almost everybody in this audience about any comment they make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6087)|
| 1:41:31| But we have people in our community that come to public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6091)|
| 1:41:36| and poison is not nearly adequate a term, if you know what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6096)|
| 1:41:43| So in terms of a civil discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| I hope we'll have some ground rules that come from the chairs or come from you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6107)|
| 1:41:53| that are protective of people that are on these bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| and acknowledge what civil discussion is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| because we have had some egregious examples in public meetings of just absolute off-the-wall behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6120)|
| 1:42:10| And these people will show, Steve, I don't know, you know folks from East Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| We've got some people out here that they'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6135)|
| 1:42:20| Okay, this is a process question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| So what I'm going to do in the next two weeks, we're going to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| Have you guys noted, particularly the chairs, the concern that Tony has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| And we'll be working on that concern of Tony's to see if we need to build it in such a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6147)|
| 1:42:33| that we address that and still allow for public participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| I appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| That's been noted, and that will be part of our discussion for the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| I want to finish by reading you the resolution of the Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| which I believe that was originally produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| I think the city council has something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| It said the commission of Knox County hereby agrees to join the council of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6175)|

| 1:43:12| by which to assure conservation, development, and protection of ridges, slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6192)|
| 1:43:19| and hillsides within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| That's our goal, conservation, development, and protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6201)|
| 1:43:27| I love the way you wrote that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| You guys wrote a great statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| You're not ignoring anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6211)|
| 1:43:32| We're finding a way to mesh those three ideas into a useful product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6212)|
| 1:43:37| That's the last thing I want to say tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6217)|

| 1:43:47| This is a scheduling question, and I guess I would defer to our vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| and our chairman to go back to their respective bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| I think all of us have committed to trying to be at all of these gatherings as much as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6234)|

| 1:44:12| and they have a gathering to which all of these people have been invited, and it begins at 630.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6252)|
| 1:44:19| So it will be a direct conflict for some of us that are very involved in that organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| and maybe a conflict for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| So I would just ask our chairman to think about that, if there's a possibility of starting at 430,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6267)|
| 1:44:32| going 430 to 630 or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| because I know none of us want to walk out in the middle when we're all engaged to finding good solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6276)|
| 1:44:41| We'll leave that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6281)|
| 1:44:42| We'll work with you guys on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6282)|
| 1:44:43| We're very flexible about what we can do with our structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| We want to meet your needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| You know, I really had my light on a while ago, and I turned it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| And I think what Tony said is really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| and I would really ask the chairs to set some real strict guidelines on how we're going to handle the public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6292)|
| 1:45:00| I mean, we've all been there, and I think that Mike really tried to do that, but it still got out of hand at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6300)|
| 1:45:07| And, you know, I think we need to let the public forum part stay short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| and not let it get into an argument between someone at the stand and one of the people here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| where things start going back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| We really need to have some strict rules that are enforced, you know, on the public forum part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6319)|
| 1:45:25| We can absolutely do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| We can become nonproductive very quickly if we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| Two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6330)|
| 1:45:31| We want to protect you guys in this process because this is a sensitive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| And when we're working on some of this, some of your emotions may be a little raw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| and I don't want somebody to take advantage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| And second is we want to make sure that we end in a positive note as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6339)|
| 1:45:44| And it doesn't do us any good to settle into some kind of raucous to and fro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6349)|
| 1:45:50| You know, the other thing, because some of our public forums seem to go on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| I mean, I don't know what the number is, but sometimes we've had 10 or 15 people got up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| and said the same thing again and again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| And we might limit it if we're talking about one thing and say three people are going to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| or whatever if it's on one particular topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6365)|
| 1:46:08| And because some of this can go on if we get five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6368)|
| 1:46:12| You know, 20 people for five minutes is a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6372)|
| 1:46:15| And what you understand, this is part of the reason you guys bring me in is I can help do that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6375)|
| 1:46:22| And if they're not happy with that, they can be not happy with me instead of not happy with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6382)|
| 1:46:26| And that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6386)|
| 1:46:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| We look forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| I hope you found this to be a good beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| I am convinced that this body will come up with a fantastic document that's going to be a model for here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6392)|
| 1:46:38| and maybe statewide, nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6398)|
| 1:46:39| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| I'm looking forward to further work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6400)|
| 1:46:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| Thank you very much, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| And we'll move right into public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| And our first speaker is Tom McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| Mr. McAdams, if you would give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| And you have three minutes to speak and up to three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6415)|

| 1:47:07| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6427)|

| 1:47:12| I'm here tonight on behalf of the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| We appreciate the opportunity to speak tonight and to participate in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| We hope we can participate even more going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| And I'd like to express to you our concerns about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| I agree with a lot of what's been said tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| The Chamber agrees with a lot of what's been said tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| We are in favor of responsible development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| We are in favor of appropriate control of runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| We are in favor of tightening the codes and regulations to ensure the development is proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6458)|
| 1:47:45| We are in favor of ridgetop protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| We are in favor of protection of scenic areas in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| But we also want to be sure that it's done in a way that the people understand what the rules are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6472)|
| 1:47:59| what the laws are, so they can comply with those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6479)|
| 1:48:03| We're in favor of making it as definite as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| And we'd like to work with you to improve the laws, tighten the laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| and make development understandable by everyone involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| What we don't want to see is adoption of vague documents, of pushing things into planned zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6495)|
| 1:48:26| of doing things in a way that no one can look at the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| and be sure what he or she can do with their own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| Our concern about the process that you've described tonight is we think you're starting at the wrong place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6513)|
| 1:48:39| and we think what was described as the goal is ending at the wrong place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6519)|
| 1:48:45| What you asked for was a study and recommendations on how to achieve conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6525)|
| 1:48:52| and how to do appropriate development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| We're 100 percent in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6534)|
| 1:48:57| What you got was an amendment to the general plan, and that is a legally binding document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6537)|
| 1:49:03| When it becomes operative, it becomes the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| You have to follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| Therefore, it's binding on the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| We think it's the wrong starting place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| We would urge you to take a step back and say, what should we be doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| Should we be looking at a general plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| Should we be looking at amending the minimum subdivision regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6559)|
| 1:49:23| Should we be looking at amending the grading ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| Should we be looking at either tightening the city tree ordinance or adopting a county tree ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6566)|
| 1:49:34| Should we be looking at enforcement issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| Is it that there's a problem with the code, or is it a lack of enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6577)|
| 1:49:41| There are not the city is not awash in development problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6581)|
| 1:49:46| There are problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6586)|
| 1:49:47| Many of them are government projects that you see on the fronts of the papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6587)|
| 1:49:53| And it's not like the development community is run amuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| You have responsible development going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| We think you do need to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6599)|
| 1:50:00| But we would urge you not to work toward what general plan amendment can we adopt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6600)|
| 1:50:06| but to step back and say, how should we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6606)|
| 1:50:10| The chamber has been working on it, has hired engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| and is prepared to work with you on specific recommendations on specific ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6614)|
| 1:50:19| We are in favor, for example, of adoption of a ridgetop overlay zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6619)|
| 1:50:25| Identify areas that are truly ridgetops, that are truly of scenic interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6625)|
| 1:50:31| that are visible from other areas, and let's protect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| We don't think this general plan does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| We think it is the wrong place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| It's too long, too vague, too general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| And we would urge you to back up from there, and let's go through this process with that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6642)|
| 1:50:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6648)|

| 1:51:03| I'm just going to take a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| I have a question and a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| How will the public get the factual information that will be disseminated to this joint committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6667)|
| 1:51:16| I was thinking about that very thing as he was talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| I know that we can put a lot of this on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| It might be that we can develop just a page or something on the county website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6682)|
| 1:51:29| where we would have these documents to talk about the meetings and any information that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6689)|
| 1:51:33| Because one of the things pointed out is that there's been a lot of misinformation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6693)|
| 1:51:38| and if you all are getting the facts, I think it needs to be available to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6698)|
| 1:51:42| I'll be talking to our IT people in the morning about this very thing, on how we can do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6702)|
| 1:51:46| and we'll talk about it again on Monday during our commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6706)|
| 1:51:50| And then I have a request that you post your agenda online so that the public can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6710)|
| 1:51:58| download it before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| Duly noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| Our next speaker is Rachel Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| It's 6.52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| If you could give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| You have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| Rachel Craig, 2222 Allen Home Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| I won't use my three minutes either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| First, I just want to take the time to say thank you for what you guys are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6741)|
| 1:52:26| I think it's terrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| I think it's the only way that we're ever going to get to an agreement in this community on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6748)|
| 1:52:35| and I am so grateful to see you doing it, and I want to support you any way I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6755)|
| 1:52:41| I just want to make a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| And one of them, and I think everybody knows this, but it's worth repeating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6764)|
| 1:52:49| is that I have not heard a single individual in this community say they are against hillside development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6769)|
| 1:52:58| It's not a question of you're against it or you're for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| It's a question of how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| So just in case anybody's got this impression out there that there are people who think we shouldn't do this at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6784)|
| 1:53:11| maybe there are, but I don't know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6791)|
| 1:53:16| I also wanted to mention this thing about the general plan that I keep hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6796)|
| 1:53:21| My understanding is that council and commission asked the task force to make recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6801)|
| 1:53:28| and the recommendation that they came up with was to amend the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6808)|
| 1:53:34| So I don't see that the task force didn't follow your direction in what they were instructed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6814)|
| 1:53:43| Their recommendation is just the way to handle this is to pass a plan that will be part of the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6823)|
| 1:53:52| like all of our plans are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| Then I, too, have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| One, and I came in a couple minutes late and I may have missed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6839)|
| 1:54:03| is there a date set for the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6843)|
| 1:54:06| Two weeks from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| August the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| Same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| Five o'clock so far, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| Unless you change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6852)|
| 1:54:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| Secondly, I think I understood in the last meeting that you all had and also in this meeting that the way this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6855)|
| 1:54:23| the general way in which you're going to proceed is that you're going to identify the sticking points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6863)|
| 1:54:30| and then try to take each one and discuss it and see if you can find a resolution to that sticking point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6870)|
| 1:54:38| Am I correct in that assumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6878)|
| 1:54:42| That's one of the things we talked about at our next meeting was to identify those areas that we feel need to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6882)|
| 1:54:49| And I think we've agreed that rather than doing subcommittees together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| that information is going to be during our regular meeting that we'll have every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| So you can, as far as the meeting times, it's going to be every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| But one of the things Mr. Joyner is going to do is utilize his staff, and correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6901)|
| 1:55:06| on these issues that we bring up, he's going to be utilizing his staff to gather the information to get back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6906)|
| 1:55:12| And these sticking points, the starting place for identifying sticking points will be looking at the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6912)|
| 1:55:21| as it has been passed by the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| That's what you're going to be looking at as your basis for there's a sticking point here, here, here, and here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6925)|
| 1:55:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6931)|
| 1:55:35| That's what's before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| I would say that we've got to start somewhere, and that's a logical place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6937)|
| 1:55:43| And then I have one question for Mr. Joyner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| Rachel, before you leave, we heard a speaker before you say that perhaps we're starting in the wrong place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6945)|
| 1:55:54| So there's that question that may come up too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| Well, yeah, I heard the speaker before me say basically we should start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| If you could wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6962)|
| 1:56:03| And that's a really important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| There's a big difference between starting over and taking what we have and looking at it in detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6965)|
| 1:56:11| and trying to see if we can resolve our differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| So, I mean, that's a gigantic difference in the approach you'll take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6974)|
| 1:56:18| So I'm not, I want to be clear in what you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6978)|
| 1:56:22| And I have one quick question for Mr. Joyner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| You said you were going to be talking to other stakeholders privately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6986)|
| 1:56:32| and I heard you mention the chamber and developers, which, of course, is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6992)|
| 1:56:37| But I'm wondering how you plan to identify and contact other stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=6997)|
| 1:56:42| That will be through my conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7002)|
| 1:56:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7009)|
| 1:56:50| If you didn't hear him, he said that will, those things will come from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| So that's a pretty big responsibility you have to identify stakeholders on both sides of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7014)|
| 1:57:00| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| Next speaker is Jamie Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| If you could come to the microphone and give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7024)|
| 1:57:08| It's 657.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7028)|
| 1:57:09| You have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| I've spoken to many of you, at least these two bodies, about stormwater ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7034)|
| 1:57:19| and I don't consider myself to be an expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7039)|
| 1:57:22| but I have taken the two courses that TDEC offers on erosion prevention and sediment control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7042)|
| 1:57:27| I just took some notes as you all were talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7047)|
| 1:57:31| Keep in mind that all zoning limits development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| so people can't do just anything they want to with their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| Most streams in Knox County that are on the list of impaired streams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7059)|
| 1:57:47| are impaired for the reason of siltation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| Houses also that were built years ago, due to upstream development partly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7071)|
| 1:57:58| these older homes are now in what is the floodplain because the floodplain has enlarged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7078)|
| 1:58:04| So you need to keep that in mind too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| It's not necessarily that these homes were built in the wrong place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| It's that the floodplain has expanded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| and now more people have to have or should have flood insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7093)|
| 1:58:20| Also, to take the trees out of the creeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7100)|
| 1:58:24| I wasn't sure, and I wish Mr. Smith had not left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| but if these are trees that are growing there, that's a good thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7107)|
| 1:58:32| because it slows the water down, or you're going to flood somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| and knock their house completely off its foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7115)|
| 1:58:39| But if it's just a matter of cleaning out the streams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| I think the city does a good job of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| Also, the city's permit from the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7126)|
| 1:58:53| is affected by what happens in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| because the county streams are part of the cities, and they flow into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7136)|
