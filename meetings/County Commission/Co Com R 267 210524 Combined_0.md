| 0:10:18| Can you speak into the microphone, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| Sorry, it's hard to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=620)|

| 0:10:29| And at that point, at this point, you are entitled to go ahead, either through him or through counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| with an explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| We've outlined our explanation, and I believe Mr. Patel is willing for me to submit that to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=637)|
| 0:10:45| I had attempted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| I don't know that we've actually gotten a copy for each and every member of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| I know that we set that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| There's not much contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| We did immediately go back at the time that the offense occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| and reviewed the video with regards to what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| And not only was the license checked, it was actually checked a couple of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| and then by a second worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| We do have the original tape where it's required that it has to be entered into the machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| Whether or not it was dyslexia or whatever, it was entered improperly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| In order to rectify that situation, albeit no rewind button that we can possibly press in life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| if you'll note the date of the offense that we're talking about is outlined by the lieutenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| was March 8th, 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| On March 9th, 2021, I've attached the invoice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| We immediately bought a scanning machine relative to this particular station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=697)|
| 0:11:44| so that now utilizing the Gryphon Datalogic 2D scanner that it scans and then it verifies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=704)|
| 0:11:51| I've attached a couple of photographs in this outline of it being utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| So it would be disingenuous for us to question that this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| It certainly did happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| We are doing everything we can to rectify and to, for all intents and purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| eliminate human error in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| We've outlined that, and we would just rely upon your sage wisdom in that we are a business owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| trying to do business to the best of our possible abilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=736)|

| 0:12:24| All of the folks that are involved in the alcohol sales, they have all been trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| They have all been admonished, and obviously this type of activity will not be tolerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| It was not an intent of Mr. Patel himself to do so, but it just flat occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=754)|
| 0:12:42| If that's all, I turn it back over to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=762)|

| 0:13:52| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| The deference was asked for by myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| It was not my client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| I do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| I had bear hunting tags in Alaska, and so I had to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| Yes, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| I remember you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| It was not my client, in fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| He was ready and prepared, and we had already bought the machine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| but he wanted me to be the one to individually present it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| So thank you for everyone's deference in giving us this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| Well, did you have any luck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| I did, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| I got a 7-foot-4-inch Coastal Black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| I hope everybody's not anti-hunting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| Catch and release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| I appreciate the formality and the request for a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=870)|
| 0:14:39| I would like to go ahead with the penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| Commissioner Hill, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| This was before you did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| Oh, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| There's one question on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| One question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| On the first offense in January of 2018 of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| did you have the equipment that you're currently using at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| It was purchased March 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| I've attached the receipt for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| It is actually on page 2 of the correspondence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| It shows the receipt where it was purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| So you had the first offense in January of this year, no equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| You had the second offense less than 60 days later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| and then you decided to purchase the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| We thought we had the problem addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| It was not satisfactorily addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| Hence, we had this second problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| We immediately reacted, spent the money, and got the machine in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| As I'm sure you can appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| we don't normally see a beer violation in Knox County twice within 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=933)|
| 0:15:39| That's very, very unusual for this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| I mean, it's not something that we're proud of, but we simply cannot deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| I mean, it occurred again, the violation, the second violation on March 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| Boom, the machine's bought March 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| So we would like to represent that we're as close to being perfect as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=955)|
| 0:16:03| We won't have the problem again, but it did occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| and it would be disingenuous for us to claim anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| Back to you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| Thank you, and I appreciate the remediation that's been taken on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| In accordance with our ordinances, then, for a second offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| we can offer the choice of a $1,500 fine or a suspension of the permit for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=979)|
| 0:16:27| We would respectfully request the privilege of being able to remit the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| Very well, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| Second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| I'm sorry, I didn't mean to jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| So we have a motion for a $1,500 fine and a second from Commissioner Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| first by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1013)|

| 0:16:57| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| The clerk will be in touch with you about your fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| Good luck with your business, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1020)|

| 0:19:11| We can't hear a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1151)|

| 0:19:33| It's the Gujarati language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1173)|

| 0:19:53| What language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| So he is understanding language, it's Gujarati.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1197)|

| 0:20:05| If you raise your right hand, you don't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1205)|

| 0:25:53| because I believe one of the things that came up before was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| this is a gentleman who actually sold an underage person on a previous violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| So I just want to make sure, translate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1561)|

| 0:26:26| And our concern from our law enforcement is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| if he doesn't understand the process, if he doesn't understand the laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| or what it means to hold a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| he's going to make the same mistake over and over again and he's going to lose his license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| and we're going to have people that are going to be in harm's way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1601)|

| 0:27:13| That's what he says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| Well, he just needs to understand, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| I told him that, you know, people get hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| We cannot do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| It could be my son on the road or his son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| We don't need drunk drivers or people buying beer underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| I got a 17-year-old, so I made it clear to him to the best of my ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1647)|

| 0:27:58| It's a store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| It's off-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1679)|

| 0:28:53| You know, honestly, I don't know, but in his defense, then again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1733)|

| 0:29:07| And, you know, obviously language is an issue here, but to sell beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1747)|
| 0:29:14| all he needs to make sure that he understands what date of birth is under 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| he checks that and sells it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| You know, there won't be too much communication, I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| but all he's trying to do here is make sure that he doesn't sell beer to underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| And that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| As long as he can check the birth date and make sure that doesn't happen again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| I don't think we should hold him responsible for not knowing too much English, my two cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1776)|
| 0:29:44| That was just mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| With a question coming up later on doing business with, you know, the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| and if he's the only one there that's, you know, selling the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| or doing the operation, the communication with the public is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| But I don't want to hold him back from business, but he's already served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| But he's already served not knowing it to an underage person, and he was one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| Is that correct in the Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| Yes, he was the person that sold the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| There's still questions if he was the owner of the business at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| I don't think we ever hashed that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1824)|
| 0:30:31| The question is to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| Okay, he's already sold beer without a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| Does it go against him or the business, or how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| Well, it's like anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| You make your judgment call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| He's the one making the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| I don't think a prior offense is anywhere in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| It's something that keeps somebody from getting a beer application if they meet all of the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1853)|
| 0:31:00| I don't want to hold him back from business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| I'm going to make a motion to accept the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| But you have a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| Let's get a second, and then we'll go through the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| Is there a second to the motion first off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| We can always do substitute motions or other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| Okay, first by Commissioner Busser to approve, second by Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| I didn't see what order lights came on, so Commissioner Biggs, do you want to begin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| So the only reason I kind of have heartburn over this one is because last month, Lieutenant Lawson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1891)|
| 0:31:38| we sat here for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| It was over an hour, and we actually talked about before this gentleman even bought the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| even had a license to sell alcoholic beverages, he actually sold at that specific address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1907)|
| 0:31:56| And I think that that was going to be the third offense, if everyone can remember correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| That would have been the third offense at Big D's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| But instead, we moved it back to a second offense, if my mind serves me correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| and we actually revoked those licenses until this gentleman purchased that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| and we were moving forward with it as brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| So my major concern is if we already have somebody like Director Boot just stated that has done this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| and committed an offense before he could even legally be held accountable for what he did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| because there's literally nothing we can do about it, what's it going to look like coming into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1952)|
| 0:32:39| And I don't use language as a barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| I don't think that that has any merit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| But what does have merit is you've got four high schools that are within six miles of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| You've got graduations coming up, and I don't want Big D's to be the place that they feel like they can go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1970)|
| 0:32:57| to buy alcohol underage, and we hear about fatalities in the 6th, 7th, and 8th District because of poor communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1977)|
| 0:33:08| So if someone has a substitute motion, I'd be willing to entertain a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| But the way that this is right now, I would like to see a lot of periodic checks in on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=1994)|
| 0:33:22| especially around this time of year, because I'm all for business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| but I'm not all for it costing some of our teenagers their lives here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| Sir, thank you for coming up and translating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| It's been a big help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| Is he the lease owner now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| So, you know, while you guys were talking, I was talking to him about what you guys were discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| and, you know, then again, you know, just trying to make sure that he doesn't get hurt in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| And I appreciate you guys even listening to this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| even after he sold beer without having a license and in someone else's name or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| So I explained to him everything, what I told him, and then again, this is your call because I'm just here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2049)|
| 0:34:16| I told him that if he makes another mistake, there is no $500 fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2056)|
| 0:34:22| There is no one-month suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| It's automatic revocation if he does this mistake again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| And also, he has to show you that he's bought that scanning machine that the lawyer just presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2069)|
| 0:34:37| He's got to buy one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| So we do not have any dyslexia like that gentleman mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| Do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| Present you the service training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| And also, give it in black and white that if he sells beer to underage again, automatic revocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2087)|
| 0:34:55| no questions asked, no lawyers involved, no nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| The ball is in your court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| I would like to make that substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| Can we put that on there, Director Book?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| I'd be reluctant because the sheriff is the one that is charged with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| and I think from what the sheriff said, he's going to pee out there making absolutely sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| I don't want to speak for the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| Well, we go out and do the compliance checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| Obviously, we can't be there every day to do those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| If he's taking the steps to buy these scanners, which I wish every business would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| it's less than a one-time violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| They keep an honest person honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| You can fudge a date of purchase by typing it in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| but if they have this technology available, why wouldn't you use it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| It's under $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| I'm kind of hearing from our director that we could have a very long memory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| but probably not put that into a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| But believe me, I think everybody, if you see any of the names come through again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| we'll flag it pretty fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| Again, does he own the lease now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| I guess he does, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| Let me ask again, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| Yes, he's got the lease in his name right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| Is he selling beer at the place now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2178)|
| 0:36:30| Darstin, he got busted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| He doesn't sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| Not right now, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| So they did turn in the beer license, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| It's not been turned in yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| So one of the stipulations was it would have to be, he's not selling anything now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| but it would have to be turned in if granted a new license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| Well, I want to make sure that that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| The second question is, and you've already answered it, he does need to buy the scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| Because there is a language barrier there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| Yes, we'll once again make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| Yes, he will buy the scanner before and maybe bring the scanner or receipt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| whatever you guys prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| That's not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| And, you know, one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| Then again, you know, I think he's got more to lose now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| When he sold last time, he didn't have anything to lose, I assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| because the beer permit was not in his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| Then again, right now, if you give him a beer permit in his name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| now he's got everything to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| So I'm pretty sure he won't do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| He spent a lot of money to acquire that business because I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| So, you know, I'm pretty sure he – I hope he doesn't do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| But –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| Chair's department, is the license under age still got the red mark through it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| or the horizontal picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| The IDs haven't all been filtered through yet, so it's a variation of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| I don't have a direct answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| If all of them are going to the vertical license under 21, I'd have to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2286)|
| 0:38:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| You know, you've got two safeguards, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| You know you've got two safeguards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| You've got the license that's either going to have a red mark or the vertical picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| and then his scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| So there's really no excuse of him getting caught again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| Or anybody getting caught as far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| And then again, you know, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| Right now we have a proper motion and a second to approve item number 6A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2325)|
| 0:38:53| Yeah, I've got one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| When we talked about this last time when we did revoking of the license at that place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| there was still beer on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| Is there still beer there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| There's beer on premise, but it is secured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| We tried to go in and buy it, and he wouldn't sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Now the question is, who's beer is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| Does he have to buy a whole new stock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| Well, that's up between him and the leaseholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| No, I guess the way it works, sir, Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| is that whenever you buy a business, you pay for all the inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| So he's already paid for that beer to the previous owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| so it belongs to him technically, but he cannot sell it until he gets a permit, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| Let me ask the Sheriff's Office this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| He bought the beer from the owner where his license were revoked, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| He bought the business and everything that was in it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| So he bought the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| So the previous owner sold him the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| Technically, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| Well, it would be considered an inventory asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| Can I ask, we had this talk before that the guy that owned the previous beer, he couldn't sell it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2404)|
| 0:40:15| He couldn't sell it as a wholesaler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| He sold it, as I understand it, as a business partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| So you can do that part, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| Yes, and then as the Sheriff has, I think, said, it's been locked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| He's checked on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| We just now found out that his vendor had checked on it again, and he didn't sell it that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| So at least there's some improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| I've made the motion we're going to vote on it, but if I'm still on commission and it happens again, it'll be like the third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2437)|
| 0:40:46| Yes, I think everybody knows that this is a last-ditch effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| Seeing no further lights, we'll take a vote on Item 6A with a first and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| Do we need a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| Are there any nays or any passes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| Okay, everybody's an aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| There's two passes, I think, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| Pass on Beeler and Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2475)|
| 0:41:22| Beeler, Daly, and Ward wishes to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| I'll pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| I'll pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| One, two, three, four, five, six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| So Biggs wishes to pass, so that would be six ayes, no nos, and four passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2501)|
| 0:41:49| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2509)|

| 0:42:26| The copy he gave for the Bureau of Finance or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2546)|

| 0:43:56| You already heard them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=2636)|

| 0:56:36| And that is so true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| Wrong is wrong when everybody's doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| Right is right if no one's doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| Tonight I want to read just a short verse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3404)|

| 0:56:52| We all should know this by heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3414)|

| 0:57:05| and will forgive their sins and will heal their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3428)|

| 0:57:43| Unless I hear objections, here is how I intend on conducting tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| First, we'll set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| We have four honorary resolutions to vote on in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| After that, we have two presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| Then we'll hold the first part of our public forum related specific to agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| We'll jump to the agenda as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| We'll break a bit before 7 p.m. and then go into our zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| and then we will return to the agenda when that is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| As I've outlined in tonight's run of show, do I hear any objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3492)|
| 0:58:19| Thank you. Let's proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| Amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| Additions include item number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| One addition, item number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| There's one withdrawal. That's number 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3510)|
| 0:58:37| Deferrals are 43, 49, 50, 52, 59, and 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3517)|

| 0:59:11| I'll entertain a motion to set tonight's commission agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3551)|
| 0:59:17| 49 is on deferral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| 49 is on deferral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| 49 is a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| Sorry, before I get the motion, is there a question about that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| Yeah, that's the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| Sorry, the motion was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| This was asked to be withdrawn. Now it's deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| Is that by Ryan Hickey or is that by the owner of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3583)|
| 0:59:51| This is 49 you're asking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| Yeah, 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| 49 has been asked to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| Essentially, Ball Homes is going to pull off of this application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| and planning said that the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| since the owner of the property could remain as the primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| so they're going to defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| They're going to basically take Ball Homes off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| move the owner up to being the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| but because of the public notice, they wanted to defer it 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| so they had to properly publicly notice it under the owner's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| And since the zoning is going to stay with the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| planning said that was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| We said that was okay on our end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| and therefore we're just going to move it back a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| And Ball Homes agreed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| Yes, Ball Homes agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| So we have it in writing from both the owner and Ball Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| All right, motion to set tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| Who was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| Was that Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| Commissioner Jay said this is the updated version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| not the online version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| I believe the one in your hand is the most updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| Yeah, because there were some changes last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| Okay, motion was by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3649)|

| 1:03:04| and whereas the Knox County Commission wishes to raise public awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| of National Foster Care Awareness Month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| and express its deep appreciation for all who help make foster care possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| and who selflessly share their lives with foster children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| Now therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| the Knox County Commission hereby recognizes May 2021| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| as National Foster Care Awareness Month in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3808)|
| 1:03:33| and encourages all citizens to help raise awareness of the importance of foster care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3813)|
| 1:03:39| and the increasing need for foster parents to serve in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| Now I'd like to take a moment to recognize the Knox Area Foster Care and Adoption Ministries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| better known as CAFCAM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| They're here to accept this proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| CAFCAM is an alliance of churches, agencies, ministries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| and community advocates who serve foster, adoptive, and kinship children and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3849)|
| 1:04:16| as well as advocate for family preservation when possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| CAFCAM through Tennessee fosters hope and aims to establish Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| as the most foster-friendly state in America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| establish a network of at least 500 churches statewide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| that support the foster and adoptive needs in their communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| and recruit 1,500 new foster homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| And now at this time, I would like to introduce Kristen Miller from CAFCAM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3875)|
| 1:04:42| As you both speak to us tonight, if you would just give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3882)|
| 1:04:55| My name is Alyssa Wolf. My address is 11200 Foxbrook Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| I am a former foster child of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| I was in foster care from 13 to 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| Being a teenager alone is difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| Speak into the mic just a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| Being a teenager within itself is difficult, let alone being a teenager in foster care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| It comes with an entirely new realm of challenges and difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| Luckily, I was one of the fortunate ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| I was adopted at 16 by a wonderful family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| However, my story is one of the few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| There are not many stories like mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| Hundreds of children age out of foster care every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| and they're left with nothing, with no one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| But thankfully, I'm currently the president of a sitting foster board called Youth for Youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| We advocate, mentor, we share resources with foster youth to show them that success is not unachievable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3943)|
| 1:05:49| that the statistics that they've been labeled with are just that, that they can beat them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| And with help from programs like CAFCAM, it makes my job a lot more easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3954)|
| 1:06:00| And it brings more awareness to the dire need that there are for more foster homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| so that more children can have stories like mine, so that more children can enter the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| with some level of understanding of what it's like to be successful with a family and with resources behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3971)|
| 1:06:19| So I appreciate all that CAFCAM and other organizations have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| They've helped a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| With that, I'll bring in Kristen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3985)|
| 1:06:35| Let's see if my presentation will pull up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| If you could just state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| I'm Kristen Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| My address is 7332 Rotherwood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=3999)|
| 1:06:44| I have been volunteering for CAFCAM for the last five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| and recently took a position on Tennessee Kids Belong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| which is a statewide nonprofit who advocates for the local foster care system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| So my job is to equip you all to dramatically improve the experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| and the outcome for our kids in foster care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| And we strongly believe that everybody can do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4025)|
| 1:07:12| If you need to advance the slide and it's not working, just sort of – oh, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| I just wanted you guys to have an understanding of your numbers in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| So nothing is more powerful than hearing from a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| And when you look at these numbers, I want you to understand that each of them have a name and a face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4045)|
| 1:07:29| and a story like Alyssa's behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| But as of yesterday, we have 696 kids in foster care in Knox County and right under 400 open homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4051)|
| 1:07:39| Now, when I say open, it doesn't mean that they have an open bed necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| It just means that they're an active foster home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| And so some of those may be kinship homes where they had a previous relationship with a child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| and they're going to stop fostering after that child's case ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| And some of them may have a full home and are not taking any new kids right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4072)|
| 1:07:56| But I did want to highlight one important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| Just our social workers and our foster parents have been essential workers throughout this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| Foster care did not stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| And amidst the pandemic, Knox County was able to approve 91 new foster homes last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4086)|
| 1:08:13| We want to keep those homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| We want to support those homes in the best way possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| Visitations are starting to open back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| But you all can imagine how difficult it was not only to be going in, not knowing what's going on with COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| but also to stop visitations with birth families was extremely difficult last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| This is a small slide, but it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| What I did is just highlighted where all of our kids are being removed from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| And the thing I wanted you guys to take away from this is that every single zip code is represented in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4117)|
| 1:08:43| And so the districts that you guys represent have some are being touched by foster care, some more than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4123)|
| 1:08:49| But understanding that these are where our kids are going to school and they are playing ball with our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| And if at all possible, we want to try to keep the kids in the communities that they came from when it's safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| Because you guys imagine being taken out of your home and then not only that, being taken out of your school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| your friend groups, your church, anything that you're associated with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| If we don't have open homes here in Knox County, we have to look outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| And sometimes we're sending kids to Memphis and other places to get them into safe homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| Across the board, our kids are pretty even as far as age goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| We have anywhere from zero to 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| However, I will tell you the greatest need is for foster homes for teens and sibling groups at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| About 65% of our kids are Caucasian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| About 20% African American and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| And I just want you to understand the why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| About one in three of our foster families nationally closes their home within the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| Some of this is because they are kinship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| Some of this is because of burnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| And those are the ones that we want to prevent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| About 70% of our kids do experience four or more placements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| And we know that every time a child moves homes, they regress about six months developmentally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4194)|
| 1:10:00| And so it's really important when you've got a 16-year-old who has moved multiple times through foster care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| and when you're teaching that kid or when that kid is on your ball team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| you understand that developmentally they may be functioning more like an 8-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| So it's important for us to provide trauma resources to our local schools and businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4212)|
| 1:10:18| In 2018, about 960 kids aged out of foster care in Tennessee without a permanent family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4218)|
| 1:10:25| And we work with those kids in extension of foster care to help find them job opportunities and internships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4225)|
| 1:10:33| I know you guys are presented with a lot of social ills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| and a lot of causes that you're really passionate about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| As a nurse practitioner, my job and my training is to go upstream and look at prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| If you look at foster care and you look at a lot of the social ills in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| about homelessness, poverty, teenage pregnancy, addiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4247)|
| 1:10:52| and you draw the line back far enough, almost always you will find foster care in the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| Number one predictor of a child in foster care is a parent that was in foster care themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| So we're not going to prevent everyone from falling in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| but if we can go upstream, the better if we're going to be long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| The statistics for children who are aging out without a family are harrowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| I'm not going to read you guys, but I will provide this PowerPoint for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| It affects every asset of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| What Tennessee Kids Belong does and CAFKAM locally is we work with leaders in the four local spheres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4281)|
| 1:11:27| and this is where you guys come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| We had the honor to partner with former Governor Haslam and First Lady| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4289)|
| 1:11:34| to do our first Tennessee Fosters campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=4294)|

| 1:27:26| or at least get some sort of education in the trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| His goal is eventually to have the senior year actually transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5248)|
| 1:27:35| so that a young person can begin working on their apprenticeship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5255)|
| 1:27:39| and knocking out those hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| because you can make a lot more money once you have your journeyman's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| than when you first go into the trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| That's a story that we hear over and over again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| as far as the massive demand for a career in technical education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5272)|
| 1:27:57| across Knox County and across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| And that's, to some extent, what this project is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| It's about supplying some of that space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| and some of the instruction necessary for people who are pursuing a career in the trades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| so that they're able to get their apprenticeship certifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| and not only that, but to get more people interested in pursuing the trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5295)|
| 1:28:21| So the idea is that we'll have a facility that is owned by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5301)|
| 1:28:26| It's administrated by the Associated Builders and Contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5306)|
| 1:28:30| who run an apprenticeship program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| And we'd also like to partner with the Tennessee College of Applied Technology, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| Most of the spaces that we've found so far are a little too large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| well, way too large for ABC to use, at least initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| So the thought is that TCAT, who are also landlocked and bursting at the seams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5325)|
| 1:28:52| for them to have a place in here as well for additional programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| One of the programs that they've talked about, which is just incredibly exciting to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| is perhaps working with the Composites Institute and the Department of Energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| on some advanced manufacturing curriculum and programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5345)|
| 1:29:11| We're still working on finding a place and securing a location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5351)|
| 1:29:18| Unfortunately, that has been our biggest challenge up to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5358)|
| 1:29:23| with the real estate market like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| So we now have hopefully a couple more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| We had a building we thought that we were going to get perfectly located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5369)|
| 1:29:34| Everything was perfect, and it got sold out from under us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| But we have some other options now that we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| and we have seriously believed that we will have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| Hopefully it can come to you guys within the next couple months moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| So that's the concept, and really the idea is even bigger than that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| This could be a seed for other industries, start with building trades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| and branch out into other industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| And that's one thing that we really need that maybe we haven't talked about enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| is industry partnerships with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| But hopefully we can show that the building trades portion works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5409)|
| 1:30:13| and we can get other industries involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| so that we can really increase our pipeline going into the skilled trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5415)|
| 1:30:21| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| Are there any questions from the Commission about the Building Trades Academy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| Thanks for the update, and we appreciate all the hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| Also, many of you have been very supportive of this project, so thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5437)|
| 1:30:38| Look forward to hearing more throughout the summer as it develops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5441)|

| 1:30:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5454)|

| 1:31:02| It is our monthly report for the month of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5462)|
| 1:31:06| We had 961 medical first responder calls, 67 car crashes, some of them pretty serious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5466)|
| 1:31:13| 38 residential structure fires, 75 false alarms, 15 hazardous conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5473)|
| 1:31:19| 214 lift assist of invalid folks, 223 car fires, brush fires, or those kind of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5479)|
| 1:31:27| for a total of 1,593 for the month of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| We had a property loss of $260,000 for the month of April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| with an average response time of 3 minutes and 20 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| 38% of the reported fires were contained to the room of origin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| Station 30 in Halls continues to be the busiest station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| We still don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| And Farragut in Station 41 continues to be second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5509)|
| 1:31:53| The North Battalion continues to be the busiest with 587 emergencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| and the busiest hour in the month of April was between 6 and 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5518)|
| 1:32:04| On the prevention side, with our partnership with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| we added two educational videos to the YouTube library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| 15,000 views for the month representing 1,400 contact hours of program time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5531)|
| 1:32:17| logging 205,000 impressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5537)|
| 1:32:21| We also added 54 new subscribers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| In addition, we had nine in-person events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| That number is growing daily, some faster than we can keep up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| that had approximately 875 contacts in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5552)|
| 1:32:37| We also conducted five virtual programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| and had approximately 225 contacts with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| So all in all, 16,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| Our membership percentages for the month of March continue to hover right around 49%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| We just can't get above that 50% mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| This has been a very exciting month for the month of, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5573)|
| 1:32:57| this has been a very exciting month for rural Metro Fire and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| Some of you were able to come to the ribbon cutting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| and the grand opening in Corrington out in God's Country on May the 14th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5584)|
| 1:33:09| and then we also opened Station 16 in the other part of God's Country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| down in West Knox County at I-140.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| It's all God's Country, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| If you were not able to attend, we do have virtual videos online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| You can go see those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| Unfortunately, you might have to look at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| It has been a great month for us in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| We are excited to see what the future holds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| We are entering a very fun but yet potentially dangerous season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5614)|
| 1:33:40| It is summer, which means a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| More car accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| Most of them nowadays are going to be very serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| because we introduce new teenage drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| We introduce sun, fun, speed, and other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5631)|
| 1:33:56| and those accidents tend to get more severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| We introduce water events, and we tell people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| assume that the other people on the water have no idea what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| and that is the one thing that we as emergency responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| you as elected officials, can continue to remind folks of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| is to be careful and use something that doesn't get used much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| and that's common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| So we really want to press that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| We would just as soon not respond to another fatal car accident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| or a fatal boating accident in the summer at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| Unfortunately, we know that that probably won't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| As we learned today, burn bans are now a thing of our normal society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| That's the new thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| Environmentalists and the environment has more CO in it because of open burning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5680)|
| 1:34:46| so we've banned that, and Knox County has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| So please, just encourage folks when you see them to be smart about what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5688)|
| 1:34:54| As always, know that we're here for you, and if you have any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| I'll be more than happy to address them at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| The other part of God's country, South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| The best part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| I want to shout out to Station 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| Those guys has decided to adopt a stretch of road there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5712)|

| 1:35:24| and it's mowed and litter picked up, and I appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5727)|

| 1:35:40| Our next item is public forum for agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| We have one agenda item-related speaker, Mr. Charles Albawi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5744)|
| 1:35:52| Are you in the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| Mr. Albawi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5755)|
| 1:36:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| He is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| We have two other people signed up for public forum-related items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| Those usually come at the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| If it's okay with commissioners, I'll go ahead and hear those now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| Do I have any objections to doing that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5775)|
| 1:36:16| Our first speaker, then, is Mr. Vernon Henry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| Mr. Henry, would you please join us at the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| If you would, please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5785)|
| 1:36:30| and you have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| Vernon Henry, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| Thank you for seeing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| I'm sorry to have to be back this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| Most of you know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| I've talked with a few of you separately outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| Most of you know I suffer from a bad sense of humor and candor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5807)|
| 1:36:52| I'm here today about candor and maybe a little bit of a bad sense of humor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5812)|
| 1:36:57| I was here last month, and the chair knows why I was here last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5817)|
| 1:37:01| because I had discussed it with him prior to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| But the reality is I was here to basically speak on the behalf of our law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5825)|
| 1:37:11| both sheriff and police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5831)|
| 1:37:16| They've been catching a really, really ugly rat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| Let me start with the Tennessee spelling bees that were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| Illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| Look it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| Spell it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5848)|
| 1:37:29| I don't need to spell it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| If you've dealt with the problem of illegal aliens and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| most of us are not opposed to immigration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| Most of our law enforcement have to deal with these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| yet people are willing to throw rocks at them without knowing what these guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| these men and women have to put up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| So I'd ask the county and the people watching this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| support your local officers and your deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| Two, we've had incidents in our town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| Our little community is not perfect by far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| We have issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| If you bring people in to create more issues for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| and you support those individuals coming in to create more issues for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5891)|
| 1:38:16| then maybe you should move somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| The hollering and screaming of racism and so forth, do we have issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| And we can address those issues every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| But if you support those issues of the people doing this, then you need to resign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5908)|
| 1:38:33| you need to move, or maybe go back into your little envy world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| Our officers have a tough job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| We should be supporting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| It's tough to hear what I hear from some of the officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| because I do have the opportunity to talk with a fair amount of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5929)|
| 1:38:53| and I feel bad for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| because most of these people do not know what these officers deal with day in, day out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| and for the pay they receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| I ask you to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| Give them what they need and the manners in which they need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| I had a couple of other areas that I wanted to bring up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| but it's neither the time nor the place to bring it up at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5950)|
| 1:39:17| I do owe the county commissioners an apology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5957)|
| 1:39:23| The group that I am labeled with has had two outbursts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5963)|
| 1:39:28| one at the very beginning and one just last weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| I called the chair an ass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| I don't apologize for calling him an ass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| but I do apologize to you for the outburst on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| You knew why I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| You knew I was here to defend the police department and the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| and you had no problem with sticking me in front of 25 Black Lives Matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5985)|
| 1:39:50| so that I could create more of a challenge that needed to be created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| I resent that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| You have the ability as the chair to make intelligent decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| I would expect you to start making some more intelligent decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6002)|
| 1:40:07| Don't put my tail on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| I resent that very, very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| But to the board members here, I do apologize to you for my outburst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6013)|
| 1:40:18| It was unprofessional on my part, and for that I seriously owe you an apology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6018)|
| 1:40:25| A couple of other members have come to me and said I've been a little harsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| Some have enjoyed my humor, some don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| From the bottom of my heart, I'm not here to insult you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| I'm not here to make your life difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| I'm asking you to pay a little closer attention to what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| We still have problems with our health board, and it's still not being addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6043)|
| 1:40:48| We still have missing monies and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| I would like it to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| I would love to hear from the county commissioners of what they're doing on some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6051)|
| 1:40:56| If you don't talk to us, we have to come and talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6056)|
| 1:41:00| Please stand up and let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| Most of you know how to get a hold of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| I would love to have an open conversation with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| You do have my respect for what you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| because quite honestly I don't think they pay you enough to do what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| But the reality is please have an open dialogue with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| And with that, I will leave you to have a great week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| Be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| Thank you, Mr. Henry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| Kay Andrews, if you would please state your name and your county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6086)|
| 1:41:34| You have five minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| My name is Kay Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| I'm the president of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| I've had a lot of feelings lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| This has been an emotional time for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| Today, though, the only feeling I can seem to focus on is disgust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| It's been a month and a half since Anthony Thompson, Jr. was murdered in a Knox County school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6115)|
| 1:42:03| What his body has barely done so much is to acknowledge that a kid is dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6123)|
| 1:42:10| That is disgusting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| When a child dies from gun violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| a community needs to come together to solve the underlying conditions that led to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6136)|
| 1:42:23| But it's not just a murdered kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| It's five kids, one at the hands of police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6146)|
| 1:42:34| And the community is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| We're ready to do the hard work, but our governing bodies have given us nothing but more cops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6157)|
| 1:42:44| And today, I watched you thank them uncritically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| Every one of you voted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6168)|
| 1:42:53| That's disgusting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6173)|
| 1:42:57| We've been here week after week trying to get something done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6177)|
| 1:43:03| But you all sit there, and you roll your eyes, and you wait for us to leave for the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6183)|
| 1:43:12| No proposals to investigate how the school mishandled that situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| or continues to mishandle discipline situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| especially with low-income students and students of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6200)|
| 1:43:25| There's no talk of expanding mental health education or mental health services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6205)|

| 1:50:37| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6637)|

| 1:50:46| This is on first reading, Item Number 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6650)|
| 1:50:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6651)|
| 1:50:52| I spoke a little bit on this last time we were talking about this one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6652)|
| 1:50:56| And one of them, there's not a lot, but there are people in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6656)|
| 1:51:02| that like hard copies to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6662)|
| 1:51:06| They don't have a flip phone, which they can't get online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| Is there a way that if they call in and ask for a hard copy of some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6671)|
| 1:51:18| these public notices, can we get that to them in a way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| Because, like I said, they don't have the computer on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| and those type of things that we normally would be using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6686)|
| 1:51:30| I believe the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| Our commission office, if anybody calls and could not access the Internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| and would like a hard copy or things given them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| we almost always provide that for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| unless it's an egregious amount of paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| and then we might invite them to come to the office to accommodate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| Like I said, they want to come, but like I said, in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| we can do it on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| We can do it over our flip phones or our smart phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6714)|
| 1:52:00| And then we're going to ask them to come down if they can any other way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| and come down and pick it up, or we can mail it out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| And I think we ought to do that in a way to help some of these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6726)|
| 1:52:10| that are in those situations instead of kind of making fun of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| for not having the technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| No, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| I think we'll always try to accommodate people that have limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| to be able to get to public information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| Are there other comments? Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| Yeah, I have one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| It was supposed to be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| We had one more line we added in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| I believe the law department emailed that to all the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| but it wasn't read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| Can you tell us what that line is then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| Make sure we're reading it into the record correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| I think what was read was the caption and not the absolute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6760)|
| 1:52:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6764)|
| 1:52:45| I just want to make sure that…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| Yeah, just the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6767)|
| 1:52:48| So you said the caption hasn't changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6768)|
| 1:52:49| No, no, the caption hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6769)|
| 1:52:50| We just tweaked it one more line in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| This way it's a little bit more…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| And this is just to remind all the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| this is first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6777)|
| 1:52:58| It will take a second reading to change an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| That would be going to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| There's plenty of time to still discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| Commissioner Busser, you still have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| Is that on purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6788)|
| 1:53:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6789)|
| 1:53:10| Are there other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6791)|
| 1:53:12| I just have one quick comment I want to add to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6792)|
| 1:53:15| This has been a topic discussion for the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| I've had several constituents call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6797)|
| 1:53:19| My hope is that this is step one of many steps to move everything that we are able to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6799)|
| 1:53:28| onto a free and online portal across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6808)|
| 1:53:34| And I hope that other…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| We only serve a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| We certainly only work on our own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| But I would hope that every other department, as they're legally able to on a statewide level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6820)|
| 1:53:45| able to start migrating that way where sometime down the road in the next couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6825)|
| 1:53:50| we have one dedicated site to all public notices, all court notices, all trustee notices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| all bankruptcy notices, all land use notices, everything notices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| so we have something very organized, very easy to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| and you don't have to sort of figure out which publication to go where and when and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6842)|
| 1:54:06| We have one consolidated place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| Now, we can only do our part to get the ball rolling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| but my hope is this is sort of a step one of modernization, as you will, for the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6851)|
| 1:54:17| That's just my opinion, but I'd like to share that here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| Any other discussion on item 48?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| Seeing none, Madam Clerk, would you please call a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6863)|
| 1:54:27| Commissioner Jay? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6867)|

| 1:54:45| Commissioner Skinmaker votes aye. Commissioner Hill? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| Commissioner Hill votes aye. Commissioner Vestler? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6888)|

| 1:54:57| Commissioner Daly votes aye. All members present voting aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| Thank you, Madam Clerk. That passes on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| It will be put on the June agenda for a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6902)|
| 1:55:08| Madam Clerk, do we have any items? No, no P, no Q, no R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6908)|
| 1:55:14| Is there any other business to come before commission tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6914)|
| 1:55:20| Commissioner Daly? Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| Last week I asked for a Knoxville planning to look at putting churches in shopping centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6922)|
| 1:55:29| I did contact Tabitha Blackwell from TBAC, I think it's Tennessee Alcohol Beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6929)|
| 1:55:37| And she says there is no restrictions on liquor sales on churches or schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6937)|
| 1:55:44| And I'd like the law department to confirm that between now and the next time we bring this up to add into our zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6944)|
| 1:55:54| Or you may know the answer now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| Specifically now that there is, with regard to beer sales, there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| Beer sales only, but there's no restrictions on liquor sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| And we don't have any control of the liquor sales. That's a state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| She did say we could put restrictions on it, but I doubt that we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6967)|
| 1:56:13| I'll find out. You're asking if she was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| No, I'm just confirming what she told me is that there's no restrictions for liquor sales, churches and schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6977)|
| 1:56:26| and that the only restrictions is our bill. Our beer permits is at 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6986)|
| 1:56:32| She's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6992)|
| 1:56:35| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| Thank you, Chairman. Are we moving on to the other business section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=6998)|
| 1:56:41| We are currently in the other business section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7001)|
| 1:56:43| I'd like to go ahead and talk with Director Caldwell again about the e-mail that we just got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7003)|
| 1:56:47| about the development corporation and the resignation of Todd Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7007)|
| 1:56:52| Director Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7012)|
| 1:56:56| While Director Caldwell is joining us, I just want to remind everybody, June 1st, statehood day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7016)|
| 1:57:02| lots of events, East Tennessee History Center, Blount Mansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7022)|
| 1:57:06| Please put it on your calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| Director Caldwell, if you please state your name and your department, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7028)|
| 1:57:12| Chris Caldwell, Department of Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| I forwarded an e-mail to you tonight, which is a resignation letter from Todd Napier from the development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7035)|
| 1:57:28| The state considers the development corporation a component unit of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7048)|
| 1:57:33| so I wanted to share that with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| You were probably aware that Mayor Jacobs, along with Mayor Buchanan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7055)|
| 1:57:42| had proposed recently moving TDC underneath the umbrella of the chamber from an economic development standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7062)|
| 1:57:55| And so we had laid out a plan to do this probably by January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7075)|
| 1:58:00| and so this just kind of speeds that plan up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7080)|
| 1:58:03| And so what you will see before TDC, we actually had a meeting with some stakeholders today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7083)|
| 1:58:12| You'll probably see a special called meeting of TDC coming up with the idea of going ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7092)|
| 1:58:19| and putting Mike Odom as the president and CEO of TDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7099)|
| 1:58:26| And so we'll just continue down the same process that we had planned as it relates to our ECD arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7106)|
| 1:58:33| I just wanted to make you aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| So if you were stopped and were asked about it, you would know about it ahead of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7116)|
| 1:58:40| because his letter was mailed out today, and it was going out to the TDC board and IDBs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7120)|
| 1:58:51| So Todd has done great work for Knox County for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7131)|
| 1:58:59| and he has found a job that makes him go ahead and commit early, which is understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7139)|
| 1:59:07| And we wish him nothing but success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7147)|
| 1:59:12| Thank you very much. Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7155)|
| 1:59:16| I just wanted the commission to know from us meeting this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| that also this will not affect how the grounds are kept in any of our properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7159)|
| 1:59:24| and this will not affect basically anything for pilot TIF related and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7164)|
| 1:59:30| So we're still in good standing that there's not going to be a dead period or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7170)|
| 1:59:35| So everything will keep going in the proper direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| Thank you very much, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| Commissioner Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| What's the urgency to appoint an interim president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7186)|
| 1:59:51| and CEO of the Development Corporation by 8 a.m. on Thursday this week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7191)|
| 1:59:59| I not saw that notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| Ultimately, for us, in our conversation this morning with Morris Kaiser, who's the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7202)|
| 2:00:10| I'm assuming, did you get a notice from Buddy Hines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7210)|
| 2:00:13| Brenda Spence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7213)|
| 2:00:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7214)|
| 2:00:15| Brenda Spence, who's the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7215)|
| 2:00:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7217)|
| 2:00:18| They were going to go back, the chair of TDC, which is Buddy Hines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7218)|
| 2:00:22| with Morris Kaiser, who's their legal counsel, and figure out when they could call a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7222)|
| 2:00:28| And so we know that Mr. Napier's last day is June the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7228)|
| 2:00:35| Actually, it's June the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| And so we didn't want to have any dead period where there would be nobody in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7238)|
| 2:00:44| And so the mentality for us was to go ahead and move up our timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7244)|
| 2:00:52| for what was already planned for January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7252)|
| 2:00:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7256)|
| 2:00:57| So the individual's already been secured?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| Well, what will happen is Odom, as you know, is president and CEO of the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7259)|
| 2:01:05| And so all that's going to fall under him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| What he'll do is he'll take on the role of Todd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| and then he'll start to hire individuals for this new role that has been created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7270)|
| 2:01:20| that's a streamlined role as it relates to ECD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7280)|
| 2:01:24| And I think, Commissioner Skinner, since this is a separate legal entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7284)|
| 2:01:29| it has to be somebody that's named for all the documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7289)|
| 2:01:32| or any kind of legal contracts or any other agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| Somebody would have to have that official role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| We'll have signature cards that we'll have to get changed over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| Banking, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7302)|
| 2:01:45| We want to make sure that we cross every T and every I before that transition happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7305)|
| 2:01:50| because if not, then people could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7310)|
| 2:01:54| We don't want any balls to get dropped as it relates to anything that is related to ECD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7314)|
| 2:02:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7326)|
| 2:02:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7328)|
| 2:02:09| Is there any other business to come before Commission before we break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7329)|
| 2:02:15| Okay, we're going to start zoning at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7335)|
| 2:02:19| If anybody is here from the Bexhill community, that has been postponed 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7339)|
| 2:02:24| In case you did not get the notice, I don't know who's in the room for what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7344)|
| 2:02:29| I just want to make sure you knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7349)|
| 2:02:30| Is there any other business to come before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| If not, I'll entertain a motion to adjourn tonight's Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7352)|
| 2:02:37| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7357)|

| 2:11:39| We met on site with Knox County staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7899)|
| 2:11:42| We met on site with Knox County engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| and we had our engineer on site to show an actual site plan, concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7904)|
| 2:11:49| which is now a site plan approved at the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7909)|
| 2:11:52| for 42 single-family lots, which yields on the totality of everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7912)|
| 2:11:56| I think it was like 1.65 units per acre, I think is what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7916)|
| 2:12:03| Again, this is another piece to that puzzle to represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| We're staying out of the flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7927)|
| 2:12:10| We had conversations, I believe, on the previous land next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7930)|
| 2:12:16| There were some talks about the intersection needing improvement with that three-way stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7936)|
| 2:12:21| and I think, Chairman Jay, you actually called on Knox County to kind of expedite that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7941)|
| 2:12:28| So, again, this is another piece of 42 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7948)|
| 2:12:33| Smith Built Homes, our larger lots, we're going to be introducing, not introducing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7953)|
| 2:12:36| but building our move-up homes as opposed to our first-time home buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7956)|
| 2:12:41| This will be more of a higher end for Smith Built in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7961)|
| 2:12:46| They will have nine three-acre lots in the back that will go all the way to Beaver Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7966)|
| 2:12:52| so we won't be touching or doing anything in the flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7972)|
| 2:12:56| I think we've done a good job engineering this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| We listened to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7978)|
| 2:13:00| We listened to the concerned neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7980)|
| 2:13:02| Flooding was the major concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7982)|
| 2:13:04| and we addressed that with staff engineering and our engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| So I will stand by for any questions or comments and reserve the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7987)|
| 2:13:12| Thank you, Mr. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7992)|
| 2:13:13| I'll reserve three minutes, four seconds for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7993)|
| 2:13:16| Mr. Murphy, you have five minutes to address the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7996)|
| 2:13:18| if you would state your name and your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=7998)|
| 2:13:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| It was 57 and 58.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8005)|
| 2:13:26| Well, then there is no opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8006)|
| 2:13:28| Anything else you want to say for three minutes, Mr. Sanderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8008)|
| 2:13:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8011)|
| 2:13:32| Commissioner Biggs, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| First, I'd like to make a motion to approve, but second, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8014)|
| 2:13:38| Mr. Sanderson, is this the property that we spoke of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8018)|
| 2:13:42| It's been a couple of months, and you were talking about the dirt and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| This is just a continuation of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8027)|
| 2:13:48| Lane next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8028)|
| 2:13:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8029)|

| 2:13:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| This is for NOx Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8035)|
| 2:13:59| Last month or the month before, we heard the property adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8039)|
