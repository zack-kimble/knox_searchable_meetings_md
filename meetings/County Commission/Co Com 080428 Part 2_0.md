| 0:03:08| No, we're still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| We're still on the same one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| Getting ahead of myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| Nine to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=198)|

| 0:03:20| We're going to go nine to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| Nine to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Nine to one clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| Not nine to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| We'll get to it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| I'm going to 914 also was pulled and should be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| You're just going to depend on it pulls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| Old firm consent should be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| Yeah, it's going to be heard in the regular motion because he wasn't moved up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| Mr. Chairman, I just have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| Since we went back to the old meeting times, since it's after four o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| Well, it's after 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| Should we go to zonings now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| We'll go to zonings at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| Just wanted to make sure we weren't out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| 921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| Resolution 921 is terminating the operating contract between the Public Building Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=252)|
| 0:04:19| and Knox County Public Library buildings for management, security, and or maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| I'm not there myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| I move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Properly move to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| Commissioner Harmon, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=279)|
| 0:04:50| Our good Director of Libraries, Larry Frank, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| I wonder if Larry might be willing to speak to this for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| And while he's coming to the microphone, I would like to ask the maker of the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| I believe it was Mr. Freeze, the Beck Center is under the library's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| And I was just wondering if this would include the Beck Center because it is under the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| I think that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| Yes, it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| So, Larry, do you want to address whether this is acceptable to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| I'm not in a position to make a decision on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| It's the county contract with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| I'm very open to whatever the commission and the county decides how they would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| rule on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| But whatever happens, we have to have some money in our budget next year because your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| staff are going to take over some maintenance obligations and some utility obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Just to make sure we all understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| They may get a better deal at not doing it through PBA, but there's got to be some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| of them doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| We did it before PBA came on and we would return to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| I want to make sure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| Larry, could you give your name for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| I'm at your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Larry Frank, 625 Oakhurst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| John, did you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| I just want to add something that I volunteered at committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| We have had discussion with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| We've had discussion with the library administration and ongoing discussion as we try to prepare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| a budget for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| We're talking about the different responsibilities that PBA could have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| Those decisions have not been finalized yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| We'd like the opportunity to work through those before the commission were to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| Mr. Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| I don't know if, John, you want to answer it or the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| I understand we're taking a look at possibly doing away with PBA handling these types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=406)|
| 0:06:54| contracts for more than just libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| Do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| There have been some discussions about reducing what we ask PBA to do, yes, and we have considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=419)|
| 0:07:06| health department areas and senior centers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| And you feel that it would be more appropriate to handle all that at one time or should we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| go ahead and at least let them know that we're already moving in one direction with the libraries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=435)|
| 0:07:22| I think PBA is aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| We've had discussions with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| They've worked very closely with us and have done everything we've asked them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| And I feel like we should allow some more time for us to put together a budget plan before everything is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| Are you going to be incorporating those contracts with the budget that you're getting ready to present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| That will be a part of the budget proposal, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| So on May the 14th when the Mayor presents the budget, those agreements with PBA will be in place or at least part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=468)|
| 0:07:57| That will be part of the budget proposal, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| And our intention, at least the way that it seems to be leading, is that PBA would do some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| but not as much as what it has been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| If we were to pass this today, I guess you would have to go ahead and maybe adjust your budget accordingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| or how would that affect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| I think I'd like the opportunity to work through with PBA and with the library administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| to work out some more details before we make a final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| And going forward with this, if we're looking at the contracts with the libraries, the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=507)|
| 0:08:36| and some of the other areas that you were talking about, would it be more cost efficient to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=516)|
| 0:08:44| and see what we have all at one time or do you think it won't make that much of a difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=524)|
| 0:08:50| I think it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| I mean, we have addressed this in terms of libraries, senior centers and the health department as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| Because I agree with the premise that we need to take a look at ways of saving money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=537)|
| 0:09:05| and I think this is a very good idea, but I do think we should try to incorporate all areas of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=545)|
| 0:09:12| and not just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| And if that's going to be part of the budget, then I'd be in favor of waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| because I would want the entire budget to have a chance to try to save money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| in all areas of Knox County government, not just particularly one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| But I do think this is a good idea that Commissioner DeVries has brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| Commissioner DeVries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| During intergovernmental and during finance, I handed out these charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| I know that you don't probably have them right now, but you will see that the library was fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| on handling the operational expenditures, what it was labeled back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=585)|
| 0:09:52| In 2003, it did not exceed $1.5 million, and if you saw for this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| they're requesting for contractual services in excess of $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| And I did, Lynn Redman was here who serves on the library advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| He had to leave at 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| So even though we did move this up further into the agenda, he was not able to speak on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=610)|
| 0:10:16| but he said that he really thought that this would definitely benefit the library system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| because the library system is having a very difficult time managing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| And, you know, the library is about information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| and they were able to take care of their buildings just fine before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| I think that we should go ahead and move on this now because in the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| it says that you cannot even nullify that contract for 180 days, so that's six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| So that would give everybody six months to work this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| I really think that this would be a cost-saving measure for the library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| And, Mr. Troyer, you had mentioned during intergovernmental that you would have a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| and I would recommend that, one, we go ahead and vote on this now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| and go ahead and sever that contract and let the libraries take this back on themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=664)|
| 0:11:11| And then if that fails, I really think that we need to go ahead and make a meeting happen to discuss this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=671)|
| 0:11:19| because I feel like that was just kind of a walking measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| because then I never got a fax and we were not able to set a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| So I really don't want to drag our feet on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| I want this taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| I think this is being responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| Commissioner DeVries, would you be willing to go ahead and add these other departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| Since they seem to be talking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| go ahead and add that we sever these contracts with the senior citizen centers and the health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| Well, now, I know for a fact that the library system was able to manage their own before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| I don't know about the senior center or the health centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| I think if we're sending the intent that that's what we want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=715)|
| 0:12:02| I'd be in favor of going ahead and doing that all today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| If you'd like to include those or whoever made the motion, if they want to include those, I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=728)|
| 0:12:16| I think technically I was the maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| You were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| And if the second is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| Who was the second on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Sam was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| I'm kind of like Commissioner DeVries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| I really like, you know, her chart were hard numbers were on her chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| I really would like to look at the numbers from the senior centers and the health department before I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| Yeah, I think she has good numbers on library and she doesn't have those other ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| so I think we'd rather not go and venture in an area where we haven't done the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| That sounds good to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| I think we should identify exactly the ones that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| We're talking about just the libraries because the contract and looking at it, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| there's a lot of things in here from the mobile meals, the, you know, I mean, a lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| So are we just talking about just the libraries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| What does public building authority do to justify their money with regards to the libraries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=786)|
| 0:13:13| And I think that would be a meeting that we can talk about that Commissioner DeVries has asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| is we can bring them in and talk about just what they do and what we ask them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| And I think it would make sense to put all these facts on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| You're talking about the entire, in other words, we're talking about maybe putting PBA out of business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| No, absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| Just operating the operational of the library and these other facilities we've talked about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| And still, I still think that there are some things that it just makes sense for PBA to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| and for the county not to do in an economic sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| and I think that's part of what we're trying to work through on the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| Their contract is good for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| and so every year it depends on what gets appropriated in the budget for the scope of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| So you can reduce and expand their scope of services as you approve the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| Will the library need to hire people to come in and do some of the things PBA was doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| I'm sure you're talking about building maintenance, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| That's an area under consideration, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| Janitorial services probably as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| I mean, Larry is behind you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| So have you thought about this yet or have you looked at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| Have you had an opportunity to really delve into it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| Yes, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| In most libraries, in fact, all libraries I've been a director of with the exception of this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=871)|
| 0:14:38| we've had our own maintenance, our own security, our own custodial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| and we paid for our own utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| Are you in favor of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| I'm in favor of whatever is decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| Yes, if you want a partial divorce or a full divorce, I'm in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| So the motion on the floor is to go ahead and sever the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| John, when did the contract end, PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| It's renewed each year with the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| and so what they do is present a budget for us to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| We're considering it as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| It expires on June 30th each year with the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| and it would be reapproved each year with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| So we can ask for as much or as little services from them as we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| So, Mr. Freeze, your resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| Full divorce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| Complete divorce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| You didn't limit, but when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| The contract says 180 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| but I think even if we could hasten the negotiation for the severance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| I think that would be beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| You're talking about immediately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| Immediately or July the 1st, June the 30th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| Can we do it immediately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| This body can do whatever it wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| We have a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| No, we have a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| We have a contract that says 180 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| Oh, you've got your lights off now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| Roundtree, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| Yes, I just had a question for Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| You had said that potentially reducing responsibilities for the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| and then also the senior centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| What responsibilities are you talking about specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| We have talked about custodial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| and doing a separate bid on custodial services that would include the libraries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| and senior centers and health department together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| We have talked about paying our own utility bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| and we have considered building maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1004)|
| 0:16:51| And we've also considered lawn maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| and the mix of how much should be outside contracted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| how much should be inside done by employees of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| as part of our decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| And then what else does PVA do for the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| Other than those, security and is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| Yeah, they do security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| They do building maintenance for other county facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| and they also manage building projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| If I understand this, then there's a couple of ways that we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| I wouldn't think that we would want the libraries to start services tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| because they'd have to put several things into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| But this question here is for the current contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| which is renewed here at the budget time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| Is that right, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| So what we're talking about is serving the current contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| It doesn't mean, like you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| if there's something that PVA might do cheaper than a library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| if we do it today that we won't renegotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| or put that into place in June or July here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| I'm asking you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1076)|
| 0:18:09| Yeah, I mean, we have an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| We have an agreement with PVA that's renewed each year with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| And so they're operating under this year's budget that has, you know, two months left to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| And it would take a little bit of time for us to go out and bid those services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| and get a contract on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| PVA has offered to look into assigning their contracts to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| so that we could do those contracts direct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| They've offered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| We're considering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| But we want to see if we can get a better deal going through the bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| So I guess sort of to you and to Larry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| how long of a time would it be feasible before the library system could actually take it over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| How are there people contracted out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| I'm estimating, based on experience, four to six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| Depends on how quickly we can get things up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| So will PVA continue on their current contract without a renewal in July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| Or this budget year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| PVA seems to have worked with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| and have done exactly what we've asked them to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| so I get the sense that they're ready to work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| Can I make one comment, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| Mike Arms, Chief of Staff, 11913 West Foxchase Hurdle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| We're looking at a mix of ways to do business more economically for the county and the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| And so one of the things we're also looking at is how to do business with more small disadvantaged businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| So there may be a possibility, for instance, that you could have several landscaping contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| and one might package some libraries with senior centers in different parts of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| So in our talks with PVA, on our side of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| we're looking at different ways to do business to stimulate more private sector businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| but also to do it more economically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| So I'm not suggesting anything today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| but in 30 days we'll have a much better picture on how we'd like to do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| And it may involve more than libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| So we're looking at the custodial piece, the landscaping piece, and the maintenance piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| But remember, some pieces of maintenance, that could be expensive pieces of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:35| If you've ever had your home, I mean, you know, it's easy to go out and find someone to cut your grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| It's easy to go out and find someone to clean your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| But maintenance is much bigger because you're looking at everything from roofs to air conditioning units to floor joints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1243)|
| 0:20:51| So these are different magnitudes of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| And we're trying to look at them individually and collectively, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| and look at the best way to do it economically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| I guess this is for Ms. DeVries, and I acknowledge that Mr. Freese, you're not listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1266)|
| 0:21:14| This question is for you, Ms. DeVries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| And I acknowledge that you have experience on the library board as well as for Mr. Frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1277)|
| 0:21:24| Either way, both of you can respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| And that is obviously, or I think it appears obvious, that you feel that the current agreement is troublesome and unfair, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1287)|
| 0:21:37| And I just don't understand why Mr. Troyer's request of a delay is troublesome to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1297)|
| 0:21:45| It seems like the delay would allow Mr. Troyer and his staff to negotiate and try to work this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1305)|
| 0:21:53| That's what it appears to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Thank you, Tony, for asking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| From my side of the street, from what I've seen, I saw people taking care of the lawns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1318)|
| 0:22:07| I saw that the library system before PBA came on were sufficiently taking care of their buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1327)|
| 0:22:14| And what I've seen afterwards is in excess of $2 million to do those things that the library was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:22| And so I have a huge problem with that when that has happened in a period of four years, that it's gone up $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1342)|
| 0:22:31| So I say if you give them time to do that, they'll just find ways to make new contracts, make them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1351)|
| 0:22:38| If they're just wanting to do the landscaping, well, then that's going to be costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| And I just say go back to the way it was because the library system was fine before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| Don't let them have the time to come up with ways to come up with more lucrative contracts to do work that the library can find ways to do quite sufficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1369)|
| 0:23:01| They know how to cut because they're there to spread knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1381)|
| 0:23:10| They're there for books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| And that is their whole intent and that's their emphasis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1392)|
| 0:23:22| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Mr. Frank, I've got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| You know I know almost all of those people that work for you downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Some of the libraries as well, and they're my friends, and I'm concerned about their future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| especially when you're talking about your maintenance staff and your security forces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| because they are proprietary PBA employees, unlike the custodial group or the group that mows the grass at the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1425)|
| 0:23:55| So we're talking probably a core group here of eight or nine folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| What do you plan to do with those folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| They're under the payroll of PBA, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| If you recall, when PBA assumed operations of your library system, I don't think you were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1447)|
| 0:24:14| Mr. Davenport was the interim director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| And we brought your employees into the fold of the Public Building Authority as PBA employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:26| which was really they had the same benefit package as any other Noss County employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| I'm assuming that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| Would you reverse migrate those people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| Oh, I would attempt to migrate whoever I could, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| Because wouldn't it be true to say that people like Dave Gillum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| and Bruce Carr are more knowledgeable about the maintenance systems in that library than anybody you could go hire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1485)|
| 0:24:52| The system that we've been working on, Marita Black and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| we operate under a variety of scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| In any given situation, how we can most cost-effectively handle any given aspect of the services we provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1500)|
| 0:25:09| In terms of the employees, we would look at a balance working with county purchasing agents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| in terms of probably outsourcing certain aspects of it as well as retaining certain employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| But you're correct, before I came on, those employees were shifted as well as all the equipment that we owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Larry, I want to be clear with you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| I know what you're trying to do and I understand what you're trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| but I am very concerned about these people who are my friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| This is totally my resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| I did not speak to Larry about this, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| But Larry and I have spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| We know each other well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| And I'm not belittling him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| I'm just wanting to make sure that it's on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| I understand completely where Mr. Rountree is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| Commissioner Lucco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| Commissioner DeFries, since the mayor is going to be presenting their budget, I believe on May the 14th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1565)|
| 0:26:12| which is just a little over two weeks away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| and I'm in favor of what you're proposing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1575)|
| 0:26:21| But could we not defer this until next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| And if the budget that they bring forth does not include this divorce that you wish to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| since we're probably looking at, like they said, somewhere between four to six months anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| if you don't see what you would like to see in the budget, could we just defer this for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| So I'll make a substitute motion we defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| Mr. McEveritt, did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| Are you sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| I don't need another e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1618)|
| 0:27:05| Save him an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Commissioner Strickland, I thank you for your invitation to speak at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| However, at this time I have nothing to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| Thank you for keeping it short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| Commissioner Ballard, do you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| I was just going to make the same motion Craig did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| We have a substitute motion on the floor to defer it to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| Chairman, can we have a date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| I would like to go ahead and get it on the calendar right now with Troyer before our next commission meeting to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| because I know that the mayor is not going to mention that in his community address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| So I would like to go ahead and get something on the calendar right now to talk about looping all of these together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:55| I guess just your personal request to him should suffice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| I know, but we would like to attend also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| Well, I'm saying he's going to bring work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| She's asking John Troyer to bring forth information by next month since we're going to be hearing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1685)|
| 0:28:12| and she's asking him to bring that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| John, you agreed to do that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| But I thought before in intergovernmental we talked about having a meeting set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| Well, we're going to have a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| Yeah, we're going to have a public hearing about the entire budget, but you're asking specifically about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| Specifically to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| To this, and we're asking him to bring forth that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| Your question about PBA and how are they cutting those services within this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| and he's going to bring that to us next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:50| Yes, if we finished on that topic, what I'd like to do is request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| We haven't voted on it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| Yeah, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| I thought we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| It was unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| Yeah, we voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| You might need another five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| You might want something a little stronger than the Mountain Dew then, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| Okay, what I was going to do is request that we move Resolution 806 up to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| It's next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| 806.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| What page is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| It was passed out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| It's passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1765)|
| 0:29:34| This is a resolution to review the status of Dr. Sandra Elkins as Knox County Medical Examiner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| and take appropriate action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1780)|
| 0:29:49| Whose resolution was this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| Mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| Our department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1794)|

| 0:30:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| Mr. Chairman, did you receive a letter from Jim Bell this week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| I received a letter two weeks ago from Jim Bell stating that they couldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1831)|
| 0:30:38| He would be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| If I'm not mistaken, that's what it addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| Mr. Bell is Dr. Elkins' counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| We asked him to – he brought it up to us that he would like to defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:58| And we asked him to – because we don't have, obviously, the power to do that – to write the chair and make that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1858)|
| 0:31:05| So that's the first thing, I guess, to consider is that request by Attorney Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1865)|
| 0:31:17| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| I think that we went out of our way to give Dr. Elkins the opportunity to appear before this commission just as part of the due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1880)|
| 0:31:30| We didn't have an obligation to do it, I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| And I think we made it clear at our last commission meeting where we offered that to them, that she could come and appear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1893)|
| 0:31:42| her attorney could come and appear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| and we would interpret a non-appearance as no interest in appealing what our decision will be made when we vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1904)|
| 0:31:56| And if we need any further discussion on this, we can have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| But I'm ultimately going to make a motion that we vote to rescind the contract with Sandra Elkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1920)|
| 0:32:09| I'll make that motion if you don't wish to, because I'm the one that said that she should either appear or tender her resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| So I'm going to make the motion that we terminate her contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| We have a motion on the floor to terminate Dr. Elkins' contract and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1943)|
| 0:32:30| Do we have any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| Question, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| Legally, by terminating the contract, are we putting ourselves in any type of situation that you might have to represent us on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1954)|
| 0:32:44| Perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| But let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| Basically, what you have before you is a resolution to consider the status of her relationship with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1970)|
| 0:33:03| This body appointed Dr. Elkins many years ago to be the medical examiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| She is currently on medical leave with the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| She is not an employee of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| She was appointed by this body pursuant to law to be the medical examiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| What you have in the back of this resolution is a police report which details an incident that occurred a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:35| Basically, what I'm asking you to do is to consider what you have before you and take appropriate action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2015)|
| 0:33:46| Could this ultimately result in litigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| You know, just about everything we do could ultimately result in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| I believe, though, that through the action taken last month and through your consideration again today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| this body has and is acting appropriately and most appropriately, certainly under the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2045)|
| 0:34:15| John, I'd like to ask, even though he wrote a letter, you would still recommend that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| I'll turn my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| Commissioner Boyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| Mr. Law Director, is she getting paid right now from Knox County government in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| She is not, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| Okay, and she's not allowed back at the facility or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| I am not certain of that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| Would it appear to any court in the future that if we give her an extension 30 days, since it's not going to cost us anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2086)|
| 0:34:54| look better on the commission for them to appear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| Because, I mean, we have been working on PCARD auto travel for a year, and we got this last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2099)|
| 0:35:06| I think you have to look at every situation on its own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| And what you have before you is a document which details an incident that appears to have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2111)|
| 0:35:21| You can read it for yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| It's one page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| And this body should consider whether Dr. Elkins should continue to act as Knox County's medical examiner in light of this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2124)|
| 0:35:36| So that's what you have before you, and I think appropriately so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| Her attorney, Mr. Bell, as I understand it, could not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| He said that he might be able to come late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| I don't know if he will or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| And I don't know if there's a lot more that he is going to tell you that you don't have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2154)|
| 0:36:02| But we are, at this time, we have an acting medical examiner, more or less a temporary position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:14| that is being fulfilled by Ms. Milusevic, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2174)|
| 0:36:21| She plays a vital role in certainly with all autopsies, but most importantly in testifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2181)|
| 0:36:30| And Dr. Elkins is not available to do either of those at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2190)|
| 0:36:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| Would it be appropriate at this time to go ahead and request an RFP or whatever we need to do to start the search for a new medical examiner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2204)|
| 0:36:55| Well, that will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Or would that just be done automatically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| It would be done automatically by operation of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| Mr. Arms, do you want to comment on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| By operation of law, the state lays out a procedure where the medical community makes a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| They have already, in fact, made that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| And that person has been discussed with the attorney general and the sheriff, and they're very pleased with that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| I just want to make sure that if this goes through, that we're doing what we have to do to get the next medical examiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| And if that's in place, then that's all I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| Well, the medical academy is going to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| I know they may have had one meeting already, but they're going to meet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| And they're going to consider who an appropriate person would be for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2256)|
| 0:37:43| And that will come back to commission at next month's meeting, if you sever our relationship with Dr. Elkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| I think if you read the report that's attached to the back of this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| it's pretty clear that we certainly have grounds for terminating the contract for cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| And I personally don't think there's anything that can be said if you look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| and the whole history that would, in my opinion, should change anyone's mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| I don't think we should put this off any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| I think we need to go ahead and take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| And then that would let the Knoxville Academy of Medicine move ahead with their recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| for the next medical examiner that's to be appointed, and we can get on with things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| I think if you look at this record, this medical examiner would probably have very little credibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| if she went into a court of law to testify on a criminal case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| And I would strongly encourage us to go ahead and vote on this to terminate her contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2320)|
| 0:38:47| so we can start moving on and getting a new medical examiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| There's some other issues just on the volume of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| and it makes it difficult for the forensic center at the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| and the pathology department to go ahead and hire additional forensic pathologists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| because the workload is becoming very, very heavy for this one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| And I think she also needs to know where she stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| and what I'm referring to is the person who will probably be the candidate for us to appoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| once we terminate this contract if that's indeed what we decide to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| So I would encourage us to go ahead and vote on this today so we can move on with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| I'm going to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| I just had a question with regard to if we do sever the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| will she be allowed into the building or will she have her access denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| Because I do have concerns about I don't want her free access to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| That will be up to the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| My name is Stuart Van Meter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| I'm 8700 Darien Court in West Knoxville in the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| I'm the chairman of the Department of Pathology at UT Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| The Regional Forensic Center sits within the Department of Pathology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| and the Office of the Knox County Medical Examiner sits within the forensic center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2409)|
| 0:40:16| I guess if there's one thing that I would like for the commission to at least appreciate is that we currently operate at a handicap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:28| We have one forensic pathologist, Dr. Malusnik, as you referred to, doing the work of two or three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2428)|
| 0:40:37| And she has been now for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| And we, I think if you think about it, we can't proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2440)|
| 0:40:47| and move forward with hiring additional pathologists to support this operation not knowing what to tell these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2447)|

| 0:41:02| I didn't come here to speak for Dr. Malusnik, but certainly she's been working full-time, six days a week anyway, for four or five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2462)|
| 0:41:16| And I would hope that this commission would please recognize that to make no decision here today is, in fact, a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2476)|
| 0:41:24| And it's a decision that continues to handicap us and prevents us from moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| and prevents us from offering that relief to Dr. Malusnik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| We have a motion on the floor to terminate the contract with Dr. Elkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2496)|
| 0:41:44| All in favor say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| No, you can go ahead and take the vote, and then if I could ask just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2510)|

| 0:41:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| Mike, this might be for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| A few months ago we approved an audit of the medical examiner's office, and we wanted to expeditiously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2520)|
| 0:42:07| and I think you all had someone do it, and we put Richard Walls as well going with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2527)|
| 0:42:14| Do you know what happened to that audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| The auditors are continuing to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| They're working with Mr. Walls, and we expect a report hopefully before the May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| I was going to say I've heard that this is all supposed to be completed pretty quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| that the audit that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| Dr. Van Meter could confirm that, but I believe it's just about completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2555)|
| 0:42:41| Clerk, K-02, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| We set a date of May 15th to have the audit completed and a report to the county commission at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2563)|

| 0:43:29| What is the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| What was the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| That was an intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| Oh, the negotiated contract is the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| I think that was just saying how to dispose of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2623)|

| 0:43:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| Commissioner Moore, I just wanted to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| I just want to comment to the purchaser there, Mr. Ridenour, what he's done in working with the church group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2643)|
| 0:44:10| The only people that could do this would be the church and or Mr. Ridenour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| And I think he's gone way above and beyond what he needs to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| The asking price is somewhere between $15,000 and $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| He took the high road, offered the Knox County $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| He's also making a set of steps that the church right next door to it that they can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| So he's going to have several thousand dollars just in his set of steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| So it's going to cost him more than $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| I appreciate, Steve, being the good neighbor that you are in the Hollis community and what all you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2673)|

| 0:45:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| How about 9-14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2759)|
| 0:46:08| Resolution 9-14 is asking all counties in the state of Tennessee to urge their state legislators to give local governments the option of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2768)|

| 0:46:28| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Commissioner Peterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| If this were just about unfunded mandates, I'd be happy to join in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| As a matter of fact, I'd be willing to go as a second on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| But I think what is the unspoken thing here and the thing that's caused me to reconsider this whole motion is the whole concept of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2807)|
| 0:46:55| federalism, that certain levels of government have certain tasks and duties and that other levels of government can't take away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2815)|
| 0:47:04| I mean, the United States government, if it sets the copyright law at 75 years, Nashville can't say it's 50 and we can't say it's 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2824)|
| 0:47:16| And what we're talking about here is if something comes along that is an unfunded mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2836)|
| 0:47:23| which is the terrible thing that every level of government does and we're the beneficiary of everything from state and federal above us, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2843)|
| 0:47:30| But what happens is this really changes the fundamental relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| We say if we believe that there is not enough money in the budget for this, we can opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2855)|
| 0:47:42| And that's really assuming a power and changing the whole balance of power relationship between local and state government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2862)|
| 0:47:49| And I just don't think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| Let me just give you a few examples here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| What if there were a change in law regarding voting rights and that certain voting machines that Knox County used were declared ineligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2873)|
| 0:48:03| and they were in certain minority districts and to not replace them would be a civil rights violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2883)|
| 0:48:09| And we said, well, you didn't send the money to replace them, so we're going to ignore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| We really get ourselves in a big mess when we start picking and choosing the state laws just because the folks in Nashville didn't have the good sense to fund them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2893)|
| 0:48:23| It changes the balance of power between the relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| I think it invites lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| I think it really smacks of wholesale reshuffling of the notion of federalism, that certain governments have certain responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2908)|
| 0:48:38| And, therefore, I think on reflection, we shouldn't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2918)|
| 0:48:46| Commissioner Hingston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Commissioner Harmon, you may be correct, but at this time in our government right now with the state having a shortfall in revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2928)|
| 0:48:56| they will start implementing for our counties in Tennessee to start doing things that they should be funding us for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2936)|
| 0:49:06| And we have to do them whether they send the money or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| So I think they should give us the option to whether or not we want to do that since they're not sending the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2950)|
| 0:49:16| But you'll see they'll be coming in here now for us to do things and they're not giving us any money to do it with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2956)|
| 0:49:23| And our revenue is also down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| And I don't think that they should put a burden like that on the taxpayers of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| If they can't back up to do something about their revenue, we certainly can't do anything about ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| And I don't want them telling us what to do when we don't have the money to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| Commissioners, I understand your resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| We're just asking the counties, the other 94 counties, to urge their legislators to give the local governments the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2986)|
| 0:49:54| So we're not actually mandating anything or asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| We're just encouraging all counties to contact their legislators to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| And so I'm in favor of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3001)|
| 0:50:08| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3008)|

| 0:53:15| I am against toll roads in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| I believe that our citizens are against toll roads in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| What this does is it basically says we don't want a toll road in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| Now that's for your groundwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| This morning I received a visit from members of the governor's staff who are in town with the tourism department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3211)|
| 0:53:39| And they met with me for about 30 minutes and said that they would really like to see the feasibility study continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| That they would like to go ahead and do the work and then present to the transportation planning organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| and then eventually with the county commission to talk about the feasibility study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3230)|
| 0:53:56| They asked if I would propose a postponement of this to give them the opportunity to come and speak with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3236)|
| 0:54:05| about the need for this feasibility study and why they felt that it would be appropriate to move ahead with the feasibility study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3245)|
| 0:54:12| I told them that out of courtesy to the governor and his staff that I would bring it forward for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3252)|
| 0:54:18| I will tell you that I don't like toll roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| Don't want a toll road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| I've heard people say that, well, they're coming anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| Well, maybe so, but maybe after I'm gone, you know, they'll come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| I've heard that all these other states have toll roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| I don't want to be like New Jersey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| I don't want to be like Chicago and these other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| I don't want to be like Orlando where my son lives and we travel toll roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| I just don't believe that our citizens want a toll road crammed down their throats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| And so my feeling is this is not about the road, and I want to make it very clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| this is not about whether the road should be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| This is about whether it should become a toll road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| So out of courtesy to the governor's staff, I told them I would bring this up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| I wanted to make you fully aware of what was going on and just for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:09| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| Yeah, I just wanted to say I'm a co-sponsor of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| and I am commissioner in the 6th District where the Orange Route is going to be running through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| And the people of the 6th District are emphatically against toll roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| And I think what we're going to see in the future is we're going to see governments move away from toll roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| Technology has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| Your automobile GPS can tell you how to avoid toll roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| So putting toll roads in are going to have the opposite effect of what they're designed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| What's going to happen is people are going to hit that little avoid toll roads button,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| and it's going to throw travelers on the back roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| I don't want those travelers on the back roads of the 6th District making life dangerous for those citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3351)|
| 0:55:58| That's why I'm voting for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| And I'm not saying that the state can't put toll roads somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3360)|
| 0:56:06| Maybe there's a community that likes them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| But my community certainly does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| I agree with Commissioner Lambert, and I respect Commissioner Hammond asking that this be deferred or withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3375)|
| 0:56:24| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| I'm not asking it be deferred and withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| I just wanted you to know that that request was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| I'm voting in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| I'm not asking it be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| My comment is I don't wish for the state to spend $250,000 of taxpayer money on something that Knox County does not want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3393)|
| 0:56:42| So why even do the feasibility study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| So I think we need to go ahead and send a message to them loud and clear, Knox County does not want toll roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3404)|
| 0:56:51| and we don't want them to waste $250,000 on a study for something we don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3411)|
| 0:57:03| Shoot, all these claps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| I might need to get mine in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| Now, Commissioner Hammond, if we voted for this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| would the governor's office not want to come and make a recommendation to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| or let us know what the rationale is in this feasibility study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| Because I, unlike a lot of folks, I'm really wanting to get all the information on toll roads in general, if they're coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3454)|
| 0:57:44| and in particular, you know, if they're coming to our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| So would they come if we voted this resolution in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3467)|
| 0:57:54| We're sending a message to the governor and to the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| and everyone that we don't want toll roads in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| They can have them in other parts of the state if other parts want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| We could request that they come and do a briefing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| I'm not sure what the status of the feasibility study will be, frankly, after our vote today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| but I'm sure that if the feasibility study goes forward that we'd be more than happy to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| and present that to us when they're here to do it for the transportation planning organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| But I guess my question is, per your conversation today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| was the dialogue that they will come, that they want you to pull this so that they will come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| I mean, are those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| Well, they had asked that we postpone it so that they would have the opportunity to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| and talk about the need for the feasibility study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| And so I told them that out of courtesy to the governor that I would be happy to bring it forward to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| and let you vote on it, and I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| I've fulfilled my promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| Well, once again, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3539)|
| 0:59:05| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| 918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| Resolution 918 is instructing the Knox County Law Director to seek guidance and clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| from Chancellor Darrell R. Fantzler regarding acceptable communication between members of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3558)|
| 0:59:26| But it's 7-1 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| 8-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3576)|
| 0:59:42| I'd like to just ask the Law Director before we make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| Mr. Law Director, do you see this troublesome at going back to ask Chancellor Fantzler communication between each other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3585)|
| 1:00:00| It depends on what you go back to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| There is a bill pending in the legislature right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| It probably has, oh, better than a 50-50 chance of passing, which would allow this body as a pilot project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3610)|
| 1:00:18| Commissioner Hammond could probably speak more eloquently on it than I because he's been involved with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| It would allow this body to communicate via e-mail on a public site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| You know, I think that's a great idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| but that's one that we would want to make sure that the Chancellor was agreeable to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3632)|
| 1:00:38| So in that instance, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| In the other suggested, the other questions that were suggested to ask the Chancellor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3642)|
| 1:00:51| I think ultimately that might be troublesome, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| But on this one, you think it's okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| Only if the act passes, which would allow this body as a pilot project to communicate via e-mail, via the public e-mail address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3658)|
| 1:01:11| Okay, so this resolution you wouldn't go back and ask unless the legislature passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| And see, and that hasn't passed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| And so, you know, the Chancellor is not going to give us an advisory opinion about that until that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3677)|
| 1:01:26| So we're a little premature on asking about that special legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:34| Would you feel better if we postponed it 30 days and maybe they may have a pass or fail on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3694)|
| 1:01:43| As far as that goes, most definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| I mean, I think we might get an answer to our question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| Otherwise, I believe the Chancellor would tell us that he can't issue advisory opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| Commissioner Hammond, would you have a problem postponing it 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| No, I wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| I was just going to say that John sent us a full page of concerns, and I know that we have all gotten those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| The last thing I want is to spend another three weeks in court and having to go through what we went through again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3725)|
| 1:02:12| And I think we're all trying to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| I think we're all trying to abide by what the judge has told us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| Yes, it's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| Yes, we're under stipulations that no other government in the state of Tennessee, local, or county is having to endure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3739)|
| 1:02:27| But, you know, it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| And, you know, we were found guilty, and so we are receiving the punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| John has listed eight reasons why he thinks that we should not do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| If he doesn't feel good about going before the judge, I don't feel good about going before the judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| because he's our attorney and he'll be representing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| And so I imagine that the judge is going to look at the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| If he wants to give some type of report of his own on what we gave him, I'm sure he will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3769)|
| 1:02:56| Or he may ask questions or he may bring us back in to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| But I guess my bottom line is, no, I don't have a problem postponing it or withdrawing it because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3782)|
| 1:03:08| if our law director doesn't feel comfortable going before the judge, I don't feel comfortable going before the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| If that act passes, that's certainly the appropriate occasion to go back before the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3794)|
| 1:03:21| And you may want to ask other questions of the court perhaps at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3801)|
| 1:03:28| but I would wait until we have a good reason to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| So I'm going to make a motion that we withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| Properly moved and seconded that we defer it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3819)|
| 1:03:47| No, withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| Withdraw, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| All in favor of withdrawing say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3837)|

| 1:04:25| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| Thank you for the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| I'm going to support that, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| But there was one little change I would like to ask you to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| In the resolution we had asked that one of the outside auditors be from the Chamber of Commerce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3873)|
| 1:04:40| a recommendation of the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| Richard has suggested in the memo I sent to you that the second person come from the Institute of Internal Auditors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3881)|
| 1:04:48| and I would like to make that change at Mr. Wall's suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| That's what I said is his direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| That's what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3893)|
| 1:04:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3897)|

| 1:05:30| Mayor Ragsdale, Representative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| Yes, Mr. Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| We have a report from the Devon Group where they have sent us a memo, I think, April the 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3937)|
| 1:05:46| with their intent to schedule the closing for Friday, June the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| We've also received a letter, and that's for the pitch property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| We've also received a letter from Tennessee Valley Title Company where they have received the $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3954)|
| 1:06:00| earnest money and it's put down, and we see this moving forward in the next 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3960)|
| 1:06:09| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| Mike, the way I see the contract, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3970)|
| 1:06:17| I don't think at the time we approved this thing last June or whenever it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| I mean, it took the administration 60 days to sign a contract, which then gave them 180 days or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3982)|
| 1:06:29| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| But at the end of the day, I mean, we've gone almost a year tying up a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| If some other business wanted to come into Knoxville and look at that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| we've had it tied up for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| Remember, we had a similar situation at the old farmer's market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| and then we got it back because it just didn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| But I believe the contract says they have to close by the end of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| And also, how much was the TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4015)|
| 1:07:01| Mr. Law Director, I had you look at the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| Did I read it correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| I think they have a representative here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| Jill Van Beek with the Devon Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| The contract was signed on November 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| It gave us 180 days for due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| Once the 180 days is over, we have 45 days to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| That's June 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| Mr. Law Director, how much is the TIF that you all have received?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4044)|
| 1:07:30| You guys approved a TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| No, I think the city in Knoxville, the city, we approved it after the city IDB probably approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| But what is the TIF amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| It was approved to an amount up to $8.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| And it was going to be a mixed use of retail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| It's approved for a mixed use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| And what since Mr. Edwards from the Chamber has come to us and said that we don't use TIF for retail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4076)|
| 1:08:04| I mean, is there anything that we can go back and change this since everybody now is urging us not to use it for retail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4084)|
| 1:08:13| The project contemplates residential office and a limited amount of ground story retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| which is actually required by the city of Knoxville downtown design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4099)|
| 1:08:29| Is there anybody here that can answer if a TIF can be pulled back if the deal hasn't even closed yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4109)|
| 1:08:40| The contract is being complied with and the resolution that was passed by county commission is being complied with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4120)|
| 1:08:49| you know, to its fullest extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| If you wish to quell the deal, you know, I'll have to look at that and see what that would entail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4132)|
| 1:09:06| I don't have it in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| An additional comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| Before we moved on this RFP, we did have public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| and the overwhelming consent of the stakeholders at that meeting, and I think we had two meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4155)|
| 1:09:23| the outside facilitator was the mixed use, mixed residential, commercial and retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4163)|
| 1:09:30| So we did listen to the public and the stakeholders on the use of that property before we put out the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| And, Mike, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| We've had the head of the chamber and the county IDB board now question the use of TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4177)|
| 1:09:47| especially Mike Edwards has said using them for retail development is not an acceptable thing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| So I'm saying before this deal gets going, if we know this on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| if there's a way we can pull back or pull back the amount of the TIF on our side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| I could care less what the city of Knoxville does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| They can approve $50 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| But on the county side, is there a way for us to pull back since we're being advised by the head of our chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4207)|
| 1:10:16| who is ultimately, I guess, working with the TIF boards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4216)|
| 1:10:23| I don't know that that's what the head of the chamber has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| Well, I believe he came to us when we were talking about doing more in north Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| He said we don't want to use them for retail development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| This is a mixed use, and it's always been a mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| It was in the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| It was brought before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| It was studied, I think, over a period of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| Well, I think when I made a motion or didn't make a motion, when I voted to do this deal, I read 180 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4241)|
| 1:10:51| I didn't read 365 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| And because somebody writes something into it and the administration took 60 days to sign a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| I mean most people close on deals $50 million in 30 or 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| And this has been a year and we're still sitting still with our property tied up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4264)|
| 1:11:11| They've paid their earnest money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| Closing is scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| Well, I'd like to do a couple of deals like this myself, putting up a little bit of money, $5,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| and tying up a $790,000 piece of property with an $8 million TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4279)|
| 1:11:27| I'll do it all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| That was the deal that was agreed to last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| Commissioner Lucco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| Mr. Law Director, when we as a commission pass, whether it's this resolution back then or in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4296)|
| 1:11:51| does the resolution have a certain date that it must be executed within?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| Or did this one have a certain date that it had to be executed within a certain amount of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| Because, you know, like Commissioner Moore was saying, you know, how long can these contracts be out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4322)|
| 1:12:13| You know, how do we know as a commission that they're being executed within a timely manner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4333)|
| 1:12:22| Ask questions, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| When the resolution was passed, as I understand it, there was still some details that needed to be completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4344)|
| 1:12:36| as far as the contract goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| Those details were worked out over a period of a couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4358)|
| 1:12:42| This commission gave my office the authority to work out those details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| They were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| The contract was put to the Devin Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| They signed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| The mayor signed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| And they're within their time provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| I guess my question then goes back to when we give the law department the authority to work out details of the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4379)|
| 1:13:09| when does the contract become substantially different from what we passed as a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4389)|
| 1:13:16| and what's being executed at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| I mean, how do we know that what, and I'm not trying to point any fingers here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| but how do we know that whatever contract we thought we were agreeing to as a commission is what is being done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4404)|
| 1:13:32| a month or two down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| It's a judgment call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| You have to trust your attorney that he is complying with your directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4416)|
| 1:13:45| So, in your opinion, the contract that was finally worked out with this group meets the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4425)|
| 1:13:54| or what the commission intended to do nearly a year ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4434)|
| 1:14:01| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| It was signed back in November, so we're talking, you know, five months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| Could you tell me the details that you had to work out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| I could go back through my file and provide them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| If you could provide that, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| Come by my office and I'll show them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| Yes, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| Are you representing the Devin Group today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| Are you guys on schedule with building the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| I'll tell you what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| With the real estate crunch that's going on throughout this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| there are a lot of projects that are being set back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| And I think that this shows to the strength of this town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| and it shows to the strength of this group that even in unsure times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4489)|
| 1:14:55| we as a community are boldly stepping forward and seeing this building through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4495)|
| 1:15:02| I think it's going to be a great asset to the Knox County skyline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| And I know some of us on this commission have differences of opinion on TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4506)|
| 1:15:13| But, you know, we've already debated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| And I like TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| I think it's a wonderful tool that can be used to spur development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| I guess what it looks like I'm seeing is that we're constantly bringing back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| and debating TIFs when this one's already been decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| And I think it's, like I said, it's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| It shows the strength of this community that while other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| are slowing down their development, that we're building this wonderful building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| And I appreciate the work you guys are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| And I appreciate the leadership that you're showing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| even when the numbers aren't looking so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| If you would, Mr. Law Director, next month, can you pull the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| the caption and the wording that we passed last June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| and let the commission have what we intended to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| if it actually happened the way we intended it to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4568)|
| 1:16:13| Because I certainly didn't vote for this property to be tied up for one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| with an $8 million TIF hanging on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| I think I did 180 days, and I think that's what I intended for it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| I mean, because they had a big announcement over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| They were ready to blow and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| And now we're a year later and we haven't done anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| Easy enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| We're going to do one more resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| We're going to take a five-minute break, and then we're going into zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4608)|
| 1:16:54| Resolution 922 is requesting clarification from the Knox County Clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4614)|
| 1:17:00| through the Business Tax Licensing Department regarding policies and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| for approving or denying applications for business tax license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| Any governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| Anyone want to render a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| Is Mr. Stooksberry here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| Or Ms. Carolyn Haskell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| I sent them a letter a week or so ago asking them to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4643)|
| 1:17:32| Can you call them, and can we move this to the end of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| George went home sick today, and Carolyn is having some health problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| so she cannot be here either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| Well, and I had made a phone call last week to the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| and so far have not got a return phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| And I have a constituent that has been turned down on a business license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| and some things that he says that was said by Ms. Haskell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| and I don't want to get into it when someone's not here to answer the questions back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| if it's factual or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| But certainly we're losing thousands and thousands of tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| while this individual is not able to operate in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| This individual has several other businesses that pay a multitude of tax dollars to this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| and I just can't understand why he has been denied a license to operate in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4701)|
| 1:18:27| So I hate and I regret that the clerk's office would not send a representative at least to try to clear this matter up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4707)|
| 1:18:37| Mr. Law Director, what can we do at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| Well, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| We're talking about $730 in business tax, and my office has probably spent ten hours on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4722)|
| 1:18:57| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| We're pretty much bought and paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| But we've spent an enormous amount of time on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| It's very fact intensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| What you have to determine and what the business office has to determine is whether this operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4746)|
| 1:19:12| whether this new business licensee is a successor to the previous owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4752)|
| 1:19:22| There are a number of questions regarding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| I believe they are still awaiting information from the new owner in the business tax department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4765)|
| 1:19:33| So until that information is received, I don't know that they can ultimately get to the bottom of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4773)|
| 1:19:40| It's a very complex situation, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| But a new business, if you are a successor in interest to a former business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4784)|
| 1:19:52| then you're supposed to really figure into your purchase of that property the taxes that are due and owing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4792)|
| 1:20:01| And that money is to be paid to the county clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| That wasn't done at this instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| And what you have is the new actually they state that they did not purchase the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4808)|
| 1:20:19| that they have no business dealings whatsoever with the former owner of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4819)|
| 1:20:28| However, the business kept the same name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4828)|
| 1:20:34| It kept the same signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| Whether that's for convenience or otherwise, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| But what I know is that the clerk's office is still awaiting some additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4840)|
| 1:20:47| That's what I have at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| And I have a file folder full of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| Okay, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| If you would pass on, since we can't get them to show up at county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| or anywhere else or return phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| would you ask them if this has ever happened before in Knox County government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| And if so, give us the last five businesses that it's happened to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4865)|
| 1:21:11| This individual has obtained a license from Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| He kept the signage and the phone number because it was for cost efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| The people moved out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| The IRS came in there and seized some property before it was closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4881)|
| 1:21:26| The IRS took what they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| And this man, the only thing he's doing is renting the land from an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4889)|
| 1:21:37| From the same landowner that leased it to the previous owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4897)|
| 1:21:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| And what I've been told is that the clerk's office says, he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| well, I'll change the name of it if I have to, if that's what you all want me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| And they said, no, no one will get a license at this address until the taxes are paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4912)|
| 1:22:00| And it shouldn't be the person who rents a piece of land from someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| to be responsible for someone else's business taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| Well, yes and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| I mean, if you're the successor purchaser of the property, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4930)|
| 1:22:16| But you didn't purchase the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| If you purchase the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| You didn't purchase the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| I understand that's the argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| And the clerk's office is still awaiting additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| And once they have that additional information, we'll see where the chips fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| Well, I think it is a terrible injustice for this to be going on in the county clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4952)|
| 1:22:39| What was your question that you wanted to ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| I want to know if this has ever happened before in Knox County government to a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| Be denied a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| Be denied a permit for this reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| And if so, please provide me with at least the last five that it's happened to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4970)|
| 1:22:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| And I would like to defer this 30 days and maybe have them come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| and maybe they'll be well by next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| Mr. Law Director, I believe the law is if you assume a business and use the same name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4984)|
| 1:23:12| you become responsible for all taxes and everything that the prior person owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| Well, Commissioner, that's not exactly what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| Pretty close to that, though, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| Well, I know one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| If you take one year of the government and you use the same name, you're responsible for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| That's not what the statute says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| And we've been trying to follow Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| Who is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| I mean, we've spent all this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| Can we not say which business it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| I think it's Knoxville Pre-Owned Center coming back in from Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5021)|
| 1:23:48| R.D. Boucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| What's the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| The motion was to defer 30 days and maybe they'll be well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| Who was second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| The motion is to defer 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5054)|

| 1:24:17| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| Take a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5059)|

| 1:36:43| The property is located on the southeast side of Westland Drive, southwest of Vista Oaks Lane in the 4th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5803)|
| 1:36:49| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| Mr. Chairman, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902 and Danny Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5811)|
| 1:36:59| We're here on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| A question, Mr. Chairman, if I could, to our MPC representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5823)|
| 1:37:07| Was not the staff recommendation on this 5 dwelling units per acre, not the 6.7 that is in this request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5827)|
| 1:37:14| The staff did recommend 5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5837)|
| 1:37:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| I'd like to move to approve to 5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| I second to that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| Could we ask Mr. Seymour to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| Oh, yes, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| Yes, staff did recommend 5 units per acre because that was in accord with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5868)|
| 1:37:54| We asked for an amendment to the sector plan and for 6.7 units per acre, and MPC recommended that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5874)|
| 1:38:03| I sent a letter by e-mail, and hopefully it went through the URALS e-mail system to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5883)|
| 1:38:12| The reason we're asking for this is the applicant wishes to develop townhouses on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5892)|
| 1:38:21| At 5 units per acre, he can do 12 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5901)|
| 1:38:25| At what we're asking, he can do 16 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| That happens to be the difference between making it or breaking it on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5909)|
| 1:38:33| There are four houses on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| They would be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| Where there were once four driveways onto Westland Drive, there would be one driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| The property is in that stretch of Westland Drive that is located to the west of Highland Point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5923)|
| 1:38:49| which is a condominium townhouse development also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5929)|
| 1:38:53| And it is on the south side of Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| On the north side of Westland Drive, it is parallel by the Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5936)|
| 1:39:02| And just to the west of this property is the tank farm where there are propane tanks at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5942)|
| 1:39:11| Mr. Howarth canvassed the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| There are some subdivisions around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| There was no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| As a matter of fact, there was one e-mail from the White Oak Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5960)|
| 1:39:25| which directly adjoins this, which supported his request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5965)|
| 1:39:31| This is property that has all utilities available for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5971)|
| 1:39:36| It is actually in the urban growth boundary but outside the city limits of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5976)|
| 1:39:42| Where you have no opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| it seems appropriate that we should let a little more density go in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5983)|
| 1:39:49| rather than spreading the density all over Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| We have resolutions on file here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5993)|
| 1:39:59| And MPC has a policy opposing urban sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| The more density we can concentrate in areas where there are no topographic problems, which is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6004)|
| 1:40:14| there are no slope issues, there are no ridge top issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| it seems better development to encourage that type of close-in development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6017)|
| 1:40:24| where you already have all your utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| rather than pushing development further and further into the green spaces in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6027)|
| 1:40:35| So that's why we're requesting 6.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| The project that Mr. Howarth intends to do here simply does not work at five units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6039)|
| 1:40:46| but will at 6.7, and that's a difference of four units for the total project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6046)|
| 1:40:52| So it seems that this would be good planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| We respectfully disagree with staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| The Metropolitan Planning Commission disagreed with staff on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| and we would ask that you all approve in accord with MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| I'll be happy to answer any questions or concerns you all might have about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6069)|
| 1:41:17| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| I'll let Commissioner Daniels go first, if that's all right with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| Mr. Johnson, I was just wondering, why did the staff recommend five if 6.7 was what was sought?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6083)|
| 1:41:30| Was there some reason that they felt compelled to go to five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6090)|
| 1:41:35| Well, the staff looked at the current sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| We took into consideration the entire area surrounding the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6098)|
| 1:41:43| It is located on Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| It is located across from the railroad, as Mr. Seymour cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6105)|
| 1:41:50| There is a very established low-density residential pattern in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6110)|
| 1:41:56| To the east, there is some very small piece of medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6116)|
| 1:42:01| But the staff felt like there was no real reason to deviate from the sector plan in this particular instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6121)|
| 1:42:10| We feel like at the recommended density of five, he has 12 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6130)|
| 1:42:17| On the property, which we felt like was a reasonable use of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| considering the surrounding land use and zoning pattern and all the other things we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6141)|
| 1:42:29| A little bit to the southwest would be a development that might come close to being somewhat similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6149)|
| 1:42:37| to what might occur on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| And I believe they're right at 12 or 13 units on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| I'm trying to look at the total area, compare the two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| and it looks you probably would end up with the same kind of somewhat similar development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6171)|
| 1:42:56| and they would be at roughly comparable densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| So the staff felt like there was no real reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| or justification to deviate from the sector plan at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6182)|
| 1:43:09| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| Author, what was the name of this homeowner's association there that you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6191)|
| 1:43:17| White Oak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6197)|
| 1:43:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6199)|
| 1:43:20| How close are they to this development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| They adjoin the property right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| They directly adjoin it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| Well, then that's the closest homeowner's association to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6210)|
| 1:43:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6211)|
| 1:43:32| And the reason you went back and asked, you had the sector plan amended, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6212)|
| 1:43:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| And you couldn't get five to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| I mean, over five to 6.17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| And we asked for the sector plan amendment and the slightly higher density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| and the Metropolitan Planning Commission recommended that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| And so this homeowner's association supports you 100% entirely apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| There was nobody that was present at the MPC meeting that opposed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6236)|
| 1:44:01| And, frankly, the reason was Mr. Howarth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| and Mr. Kirby went around and talked to all the adjoining property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| and showed them the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| And they said, well, that's a very fine use for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| And that's why there was no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| Well, if they had no opposition, there's no way I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| So if I understand correctly, there's not opposition from any of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6265)|
| 1:44:29| There doesn't appear to be any geographic problems with steep slopes or water issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6269)|
| 1:44:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| Now, Commissioner Davis raised an issue the other day about some water problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6279)|
| 1:44:46| We asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| Well, Mr. Wheatford here went and looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| And I don't want to put words into his mouth, but he seemed to think it was a road or a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6290)|
| 1:44:58| He thought it was a maintenance problem rather than a problem caused by this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6298)|
| 1:45:04| And I assume Knox County Engineering, which is always efficient, will be correcting that problem ASAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6304)|
| 1:45:12| So, yes, that is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| Just from my standpoint, if there's no harm being done to any of the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6316)|
| 1:45:21| and none of the neighbors seem to oppose this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6321)|
| 1:45:27| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we do go to the 6.7 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6327)|
| 1:45:35| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6335)|
| 1:45:36| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| Just the reason why I had recommended five is because those rental homes there do need to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6344)|
| 1:45:52| And I am grateful to them for what they're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| I think that that will definitely raise property values in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| And the package that you sent me, I was thoroughly pleased with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| Your project looks like it's going to be really great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| What concerns me, though, is that if we set a precedent for that level of units on Westland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6365)|
| 1:46:11| that we're going to hear more and more of this on Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6371)|
| 1:46:15| And I don't want it to be another Gleason Road where all there is is condos and condo developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| Now, Gleason Road is going to be widened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| Westland is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| Now, just as Mr. Seymour had said, there is a depressed area right there on the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6383)|
| 1:46:29| and water does stand in the road right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| But when I spoke to Bruce Weitrick, he said that one of the culverts there is blocked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6391)|
| 1:46:36| and that will help alleviate some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| But just the lay of the land, there's going to be some water issues, just standing water when it rains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6399)|
| 1:46:44| But as I understand it, Mr. Seymour said that they will do whatever they can to try to help alleviate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6404)|
| 1:46:52| and not concern that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| But that was my concern with regard to 5 and not 6.7, was that I didn't want to set a precedent for Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6413)|
| 1:47:01| Commissioner Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| One thing I will say is that about the development, White Oak, for those of you who don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6423)|
| 1:47:10| the home – I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| You've got homes in there that are probably ranging, what, Arthur, from half a million above?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6433)|
| 1:47:18| They are very fine homes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| So the fact that they're in favor of it, I think, speaks highly of what you're trying to do, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6440)|
| 1:47:26| So I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| And I might add, if I may, Commissioner Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| that area of Westland from Highland Point, which is just to the east on the south side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6453)|
| 1:47:39| on west really to where you go down to Ebenezer, is pretty well built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6459)|
| 1:47:46| And I don't think there's room for much more development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6466)|
| 1:47:50| And I don't think this rezoning certainly sets a precedent for anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6470)|
| 1:47:55| because of the unique features of this property and the unique opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6475)|
| 1:48:00| But there is a lot of development east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| East, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| We have a substitute motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6489)|
| 1:48:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| All in favor say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6496)|
| 1:48:29| Page 36 is item 3-K-08-RZ, a request of Southeastern Development Group, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6509)|
| 1:48:35| for rezoning from agriculture to OB office medical and related services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6515)|
| 1:48:39| This property is located on the west side of Fox Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| north of Castle Glen Lane in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| The applicant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6525)|
| 1:48:48| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6528)|

| 1:48:57| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| We approve by MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6539)|

| 1:49:08| We need to go back to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| Is Mr. Robeson in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6549)|
| 1:49:30| He's changing the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6570)|
| 1:49:54| Is Mr. Robeson in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| We defer it to May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6597)|
| 1:50:03| Mr. Chairman, I've got a question I'd like to ask over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6603)|
| 1:50:10| What does the MPC do after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| Do the people know to be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| Do you specifically tell them that after the MPC vote that they're to be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6614)|
| 1:50:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| Do you tell them every month to send them something every month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6621)|
| 1:50:25| I'll check this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6625)|
| 1:50:26| But at one time I was told the clerk that's responsible for this notifies them every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6626)|
| 1:50:33| I mean, our clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| Our clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| Our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6637)|
| 1:50:38| Could you check on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6638)|
| 1:50:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| Because after one or two times we need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| Well, we can see what we send or how we notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| And we'll even probably make it a little stronger that they need to be, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| Yes, please make the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6655)|
| 1:51:00| I guess he can't hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6660)|
| 1:51:01| No question, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6661)|
| 1:51:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| Mr. Chairman, there's 10% of what we've talked about in here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| The applicants haven't been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| They haven't been here for the last three meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| The only three meetings I've been to, it seems like if we're concerned about saving time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6674)|
| 1:51:20| we need to dispense with these, get them off here, or do something with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| Well, we just asked them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6684)|
| 1:51:25| Well, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6685)|
| 1:51:26| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6686)|
| 1:51:27| But I just wanted to let you know that I've noticed that, too, and I think it's a waste of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6691)|
| 1:51:32| That's the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| I think they're just waiting until you all are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6693)|
| 1:51:49| But don't take it personal now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| I just think it's a waste of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| Move right along, boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6718)|
| 1:52:05| I heard that they weren't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| If Hardin Valley Land Partners, are they here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6729)|
| 1:52:13| We'll defer that to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| I think they went home sick today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6736)|
| 1:52:23| 922, page 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| This is a resolution request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| No, we did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| We're on page 29, resolution 923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| Back on the regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| This is a resolution request and a legal opinion from the Knox County Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| pursuant to the recommendation of the Knox County Auditor on whether unlawful acts have occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6761)|
| 1:52:46| and if restitution should be made to Knox County with regard to the review of auto travel allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6766)|
| 1:52:51| in the mayor's office dated August 17, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6775)|
| 1:53:00| John, what I'm talking about here is when I'm asking you to talk about these unlawful acts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6780)|
| 1:53:06| if these people we need to follow our auditor is a lead on this, but if these things are illegal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6786)|
| 1:53:13| would they be classified, in your opinion, as a misdemeanor or a felony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6793)|
| 1:53:26| Commissioner, I'm not able to give you an opinion on that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6806)|
| 1:53:32| What we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6812)|
| 1:53:34| and we've talked about it several times, is to consider this audit, along with the PCART audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6814)|
| 1:53:44| that we talked about, I guess, a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6824)|
| 1:53:50| I believe that they are related, and I want you to have all the facts before you because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6830)|
| 1:54:00| I am certain that they're related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| The comptroller basically admitted that to me over the telephone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6843)|
| 1:54:09| You may not wish to admit it now, but they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6849)|
| 1:54:14| And I just thought they were related all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6854)|
| 1:54:18| So before an opinion is given as to that, we need to have the PCART audit in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6858)|
| 1:54:30| And I assure you that I will consider both of them and provide you with an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6870)|
| 1:54:38| Well, what I'm concerned about is the way we've been slow walking this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6878)|
| 1:54:47| If these are declared misdemeanors, the travel allowance would be past the statute of limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6887)|
| 1:54:55| because we exposed that on May the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| And we're getting awful close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| And that's what I'm a little bit concerned of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| Now, I've talked to the auditor personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6908)|
| 1:55:12| and he thinks that we should address these one at a time to keep everybody getting some confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6912)|
| 1:55:18| If we tie them up together, we're going to be one guy will be talking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6918)|
| 1:55:23| one person will be talking about this, one woman will be talking about this, and we'll be more confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6923)|
| 1:55:28| Now, going to the second resolution there, I'm jumping aboard a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6928)|
| 1:55:34| But I talked to the auditor, and he told me that we probably should handle the travel allowance audit on May the 8th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6934)|
| 1:55:48| and the PCART the 9th this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6948)|
| 1:55:52| And I feel like that we really need to get involved in these things because we have such a short time to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6952)|
| 1:55:58| and the budget's coming on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6958)|
| 1:56:01| And like I say, I'm worried about the statute of limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6961)|
| 1:56:04| You know, that's what happened on the Tyler Harbor deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6964)|
| 1:56:09| And so that's why I was trying to get a legal opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| whether or not you thought they may be misdemeanors or a Class E felony or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6972)|
| 1:56:18| I think it's totally inaccurate, misleading to throw in Tyler Harbor into this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6978)|
| 1:56:24| I mean, that was a totally separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| The DA got involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| The DA made two appearances before this body regarding Tyler Harbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| That has nothing to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| Well, I didn't say that it had anything to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| I said that you told us that it passed the statute of limitations and no longer could we do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=6999)|
| 1:56:44| That was said here at a commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| I don't want to see these things get past that is what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7007)|
| 1:56:51| Well, it hasn't been determined yet whether a crime may have been committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7011)|
| 1:56:56| I agree with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7016)|
| 1:56:57| That's really why I'm saying we need to address these situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| And we will as soon as we get the audits in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7021)|
| 1:57:07| How long do you think that the only thing that's holding this audit up is coming out of the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7027)|
| 1:57:15| Is there information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| How long do you think we should delay this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7036)|
| 1:57:20| I think Mr. Walls needs to have information in hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7040)|
| 1:57:25| and I don't know what steps he has taken recently to gain information or if information is being withheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7045)|
| 1:57:32| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7052)|
| 1:57:33| I have not been involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7053)|
| 1:57:40| Mr. Pinkston, I think that Mr. Walls came to my office before he went on to this conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7060)|
| 1:57:46| and I think he does have all the information now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| But the comptroller in Nashville still has some type of deal to play into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7069)|
| 1:57:55| and he didn't think that the last part of the last review wouldn't be ready until about the 15th of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7075)|
| 1:58:05| He told me about mid-May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| The comptroller said that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| No, Richard Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7089)|
| 1:58:11| He came to my office last Friday before he went on this conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7091)|
| 1:58:16| I talked to him Wednesday, and he told me he thought the 8th and 9th would be satisfactory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7096)|
| 1:58:24| I believe that was before we found out that Dwight had all this since the 17th of last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7104)|
| 1:58:30| He told me that he didn't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| He told me mid-May, and I said about the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7112)|
| 1:58:36| I wish we would have gone on and had the one on the 23rd to do the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7116)|
| 1:58:41| That's what you're requesting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| I think we should have went on, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| That's what Mr. Walls had recommended to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7126)|
| 1:58:49| He said it's probably better to do one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| That's what he told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7131)|
| 1:58:52| So I think we should set a date since the travel audit is a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| I think we should set a date for the travel audit before the 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7135)|
| 1:59:00| because he told me it was ready and he said they should be handled one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7140)|
| 1:59:04| That's what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7144)|
| 1:59:05| I don't know why the consideration of his body to not do that one on the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7145)|
| 1:59:12| But that's what would be our pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| So we're back to the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| Could we have one on, like, May the 8th to travel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7157)|
| 1:59:23| Do I need to make a motion and see where it goes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| Or can we just need to make a motion that we hold the travel audit on May the 8th at 10 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7165)|
| 1:59:33| Yes, we all held the travel audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7178)|
| 1:59:41| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7183)|
| 1:59:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7184)|
| 1:59:47| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| One of the primary reasons that we did not vote on that is that we got into dialogue with the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7190)|
| 2:00:00| and I was in agreement with him that these are not two separate audits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| that these audits are connected and that we should deal with them kind of in one fell swoop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7204)|
| 2:00:10| I think Commissioner Lambert echoed that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7210)|
| 2:00:14| So I don't think we took it, you know, half-hearted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7214)|
| 2:00:18| I think we acted on some of the advice we got, and I think that was good advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7218)|
| 2:00:22| And I still think that we need to deal with this audit as an audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7222)|
| 2:00:26| not as a piece here on the PCAR and a piece here on the travel issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7226)|
| 2:00:31| I think it's one body of work, and we need to deal with it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7231)|
| 2:00:36| Mr. McKenzie, we have several more audits coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7236)|
| 2:00:39| Are we going to wait until we get every one of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| These are the two that we've made requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7242)|
| 2:00:45| You know, if you've ever been checked with the IRS or the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7245)|
| 2:00:49| and I believe Mr. Daniels here says he's a CPA or an auditor or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7249)|
| 2:00:55| But, anyway, they send their people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7255)|
| 2:00:58| And when the auditor comes in and checks you and he has evidence, then he goes to the lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7258)|
| 2:01:05| and the lawyer comes and prosecutes you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| So I think we need to go by the advice of our auditor because that is his job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7267)|
| 2:01:12| and he says that they need to be handled one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| And I think that's the way it should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| He said he thought it would be best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| Could the law director kind of speak on it, I see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7280)|
| 2:01:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7284)|
| 2:01:25| You know, I beg to differ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| Mr. Walls was not part of the conversation that I had with the comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7287)|
| 2:01:34| See, I think they jumped to a conclusion without having the full benefit of the PCARD audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7294)|
| 2:01:44| And now whether that will require them to revisit it or not, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7304)|
| 2:01:49| But I think a lot depends upon their recommendations as they are finalized with the PCARD audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7309)|
| 2:01:56| I think there's no question that they're related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| I think there's no question that they ought to be considered together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7319)|
| 2:02:06| You know, if you look at the travel audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7326)|
| 2:02:17| you pretty much have to look and see what was the intent of the county commission as to at least one issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7337)|
| 2:02:24| and that was the $20,000 account that the mayor has utilized under different names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7344)|
| 2:02:35| And this body in January voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7355)|
| 2:02:39| You had a resolution before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| You voted not to rescind the previous action, not to revise the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7361)|
| 2:02:52| not to freeze those funds through the remainder of the budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7372)|
| 2:02:57| Now, that is an expression of intent of this body as to what you have wished to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7377)|
| 2:03:05| or what you understood was to be done with those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7385)|
| 2:03:11| And so it may come down somewhat at least as to that aspect of that audit to what the commission intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7391)|
| 2:03:20| And I think that's an indication, the action that you took in January, that was your action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7400)|
| 2:03:27| I remember Commissioner Strickland, now Chairman Strickland, saying that that is what, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7407)|
| 2:03:38| that's what was intended when the budget was passed was that he received the benefit of that $20,000 account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7418)|
| 2:03:46| something to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7426)|
| 2:03:49| So all of those things will be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7429)|
| 2:03:52| but there were a number of travel-related expenses that were paid for with P cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7432)|
| 2:03:58| I just don't see how you can ultimately separate the two when that has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7438)|
| 2:04:06| There are different policies in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| One of the arguments that will be put forth by the administration is that, on the one hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7448)|
| 2:04:16| you'll have a policy that will allow an expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7456)|
| 2:04:19| On the other, you won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7459)|
| 2:04:22| You'll have a policy that it will either be silent or it will not allow such an expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7462)|
| 2:04:30| So there are a lot of things to consider, especially policies that may be countervailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7470)|
| 2:04:41| That's why I believe they should be considered at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7481)|
| 2:04:45| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7487)|
| 2:04:48| At some point, we have to turn the page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7488)|
| 2:04:52| and we're not going to turn the page until we have addressed these audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7492)|
| 2:04:56| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we hear both audits together May the 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7496)|
| 2:05:03| immediately following our Intergovernmental and Finance Committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7503)|
| 2:05:06| We're going to be here anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7506)|
| 2:05:07| We're meeting jointly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| We should be able to be done by 1030, 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7509)|
| 2:05:12| Take it quick, or even sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7512)|
| 2:05:14| Even sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| And as soon as it's over, let's take a break and then come right back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7516)|
| 2:05:19| And then, if we need to, carry it into May the 20th, which is on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7519)|
| 2:05:25| But let's get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7527)|
| 2:05:32| Did we vote to have both Intergovernmental and Finance together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7532)|
| 2:05:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7536)|
| 2:05:37| We're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7537)|
| 2:05:38| So I'm jumping the gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7538)|
| 2:05:41| I think that's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| It's been added there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7542)|
| 2:05:43| It's going to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7543)|
| 2:05:44| That's just my suggestion is let's go ahead and set the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7544)|
| 2:05:46| You said mid-May he would have this stuff done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7546)|
| 2:05:50| I would like to say one thing since you're talking about that, Tank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7550)|
| 2:05:54| and you brought up about the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7554)|
| 2:05:56| I think it was improper to have the two committees together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7556)|
| 2:06:00| and say that we had a majority of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7560)|
| 2:06:03| If that's the case, we have ten people on finance at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7563)|
| 2:06:08| and if a lot of things we vote 10-0, why do we even bring them to the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7568)|
| 2:06:13| You understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7573)|
| 2:06:14| So that needs to go to the Rules Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7574)|
| 2:06:17| and let them decide whether that can ever be done again or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7577)|
| 2:06:21| And on top of that, some of these commissioners got to vote twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7581)|
| 2:06:26| because they filled in for their people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| their counterparts on intergovernmental and finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7588)|
| 2:06:33| Now, so if you took those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| if you just took two of those votes away of two of those commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| it would have been only a nine-count vote, which would have failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| So we really don't need to be setting a precedence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| and I don't know why we were even voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7605)|
| 2:06:47| I'm with Commissioner Briggs on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| That was set to go forward while we even voted on that nullified at the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7609)|
| 2:06:55| I mean at the committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7615)|
| 2:06:58| So that doesn't need to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7618)|
| 2:07:01| We need to do something, and it needs to go to the Rules Committee, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7621)|
| 2:07:04| saying that can no longer happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7624)|
| 2:07:08| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7628)|
| 2:07:10| Yes, I'd like to add a little friendly amendment to our meeting on the 19th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7630)|
| 2:07:15| that follows intergovernmental and finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| If there is any delay in turning in any papers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7637)|
| 2:07:20| or if there's not sufficient documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7640)|
| 2:07:23| I say that we go ahead and meet anyway with what we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7643)|
| 2:07:26| and no more canceling or no more putting off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| and go ahead and meet with what we've got with the auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| I agree with that, Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7651)|
| 2:07:33| I think we need to tell our auditor to set a drop-dead date that anything received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7653)|
| 2:07:39| after a date that he finishes at the audit, whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7659)|
| 2:07:45| and if there's further information, that can just be presented on the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7665)|
| 2:07:50| But he needs to finish his audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7670)|
| 2:07:52| He needs to set a date and just stick to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7672)|
| 2:07:58| Anything turning after that will just have to be discussed on the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7678)|
| 2:08:02| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| First of all, I want to make clear that I was not a CPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7686)|
| 2:08:11| I have done audits, as Commissioner Pinkston said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| and basically an audit is nothing more than an attempt to follow or find a paper trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7695)|
| 2:08:21| It's to make sure that you have checks and balances in an accounting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7701)|
| 2:08:27| and you're also looking for consistencies or inconsistencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7707)|
| 2:08:31| And Richard and I have talked on several occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7711)|
| 2:08:36| and just like with any other type of discipline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7716)|
| 2:08:40| different auditors are going to have different opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| There's been some things the way Richard's done it that I don't agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| That doesn't mean that Richard isn't a good auditor, and I am, or vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7728)|
| 2:08:52| It's just that, you know, there are things that the way they've been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7732)|
| 2:08:56| you know, releasing of an audit prematurely, I don't agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7736)|
| 2:08:59| I know John gave that okay, but that's something that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7739)|
| 2:09:04| an audit isn't complete until all the questions that have been asked have been answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7744)|
| 2:09:09| and then if follow-ups are needed, then the follow-ups are answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7749)|
| 2:09:12| That's when an audit's complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7752)|
| 2:09:15| You know, I don't recommend waiting until every single audit's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7755)|
| 2:09:22| I think every department in Knox County Government should be audited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7762)|
| 2:09:26| and I think it should be a thorough audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| I don't think it should be a surface audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| I think if you want to find out, you know, where this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7770)|
| 2:09:34| and how far and how deep it runs, then you don't do it to just one department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7774)|
| 2:09:39| You do it to every single department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7779)|
| 2:09:43| Not to the level that this one's been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| and that isn't taken up for the mayor or anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7786)|
| 2:09:50| It's just if you're going to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7790)|
| 2:09:51| you start with the largest departments and work your way down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| because the sophistication in the larger departments allow them to do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7795)|
| 2:10:00| that other smaller departments can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7800)|
| 2:10:03| So, you know, I have no problem whatsoever in meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7803)|
| 2:10:07| You know, I, too, Commissioner Pinkston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7807)|
| 2:10:10| am concerned that if there's been some things that have been done illegally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7810)|
| 2:10:13| I do not want to wait until, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7813)|
| 2:10:18| we pass the date of being able to do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7818)|
| 2:10:21| I agree with that 110%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| But I agree with the law director that these are tied together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7823)|
| 2:10:29| It's the same department, and I think if we do these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| and wait until both of them are presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| you're going to be able to see consistencies in what's been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7834)|
| 2:10:38| and the way it's been done, where if you do them a piecemeal at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7838)|
| 2:10:43| it's hard to try to look back and say, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| a week ago or a couple days ago, what was it we saw in this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7845)|
| 2:10:49| You know, we talk about the voters being intelligent enough to make wise decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7849)|
| 2:10:54| I think the people on this commission are wise enough to be able to sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| and look at two audits in one day and have an idea of what's been going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7857)|
| 2:11:02| or what hasn't been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| Commissioner Daniels, let me correct you on a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7864)|
| 2:11:08| Every department up here has been audited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7868)|
| 2:11:10| You're new here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| And I believe that WBIR went with the Open Records Act is the reason why John had to release this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7872)|
| 2:11:19| I mean Richard had to release the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7879)|
| 2:11:20| Is that not correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7880)|
| 2:11:22| So we had no choice as Open Records Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| But everybody has been audited, every department, sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7885)|
| 2:11:29| highway department, every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| And we have not just Richard as a CPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7891)|
| 2:11:35| We have the comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7895)|
| 2:11:37| And we have a private citizen who's a CPA that's been looking at this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7897)|
| 2:11:41| So it's not just Richard's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| Most of these people, as far as I know, all of them are in agreement with Richard Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7903)|
| 2:11:49| So, you know, that's, I mean, you may not agree with him, I may not agree with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7909)|
| 2:11:52| but we have other CPAs that are in agreement with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7912)|
| 2:11:56| And so I'm going to commend Richard Walsh for the job he's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7916)|
| 2:11:59| and him releasing that audit prematurely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| He had to by the law, and he was directed by the law director to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7922)|
| 2:12:06| And I perfectly understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7926)|
| 2:12:08| And that's exactly what I said, is that I don't agree with the early release of any audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7928)|
| 2:12:14| Now, it is true he was told to release it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7934)|
| 2:12:17| But I still don't agree with the fact that it was released, whether it was by the law or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7937)|
| 2:12:22| That's a premature release of information that's still under investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7942)|
| 2:12:27| And in an audit, an audit isn't an audit until, as I stated, those steps have been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7947)|
| 2:12:34| It's a work in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7954)|
| 2:12:37| Well, part of the holdback has been withholding the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7957)|
| 2:12:40| I believe one of those checks, if I'm not mistaken, that I talked to Rebecca about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7960)|
| 2:12:45| that we've been waiting on was dated March the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7965)|
| 2:12:49| Is that correct, Ms. Rebecca?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7969)|
| 2:12:53| You think that's correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7973)|
| 2:12:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7975)|
| 2:12:56| So it was March 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7976)|
| 2:12:57| Why did we just get that last Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7977)|
| 2:13:03| And, Commissioner Pinkston, I had talked to Richard before about setting dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7983)|
| 2:13:09| that if it isn't in by this date, that's the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7989)|
| 2:13:11| That's the last chance you have of being able to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| I don't, you know, audits shouldn't go on for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7994)|
| 2:13:17| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7997)|
| 2:13:18| And I'm going to go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7998)|
| 2:13:19| We need to freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=7999)|
| 2:13:20| If it's not in there, we need to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| We need to stop the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8002)|
| 2:13:23| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8003)|
| 2:13:24| I know we do, but we have people that are waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8004)|
| 2:13:26| Dwight Van de Veen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8006)|
| 2:13:28| Mr. Chairman, I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8008)|
| 2:13:29| Just for the record, we have two follow-up requests from Mr. Wall's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8009)|
| 2:13:35| subsequent to our initial response to the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8015)|
| 2:13:40| One was dated April 3rd, and one was dated April 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| We have responded to both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| We have provided all of the documentation that has been requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8025)|
| 2:13:50| So to the best of our knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8030)|
| 2:13:52| we have no open requests for records or information from the Department of Internal Audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8032)|
| 2:13:57| So we've provided everything they've asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8037)|
| 2:14:00| and we would anticipate they'll be ready to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8040)|
| 2:14:05| Commissioner DeFreeze?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8045)|
| 2:14:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8046)|
| 2:14:07| Commissioner Hammond, did you accept my friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8047)|
| 2:14:10| I did, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8050)|
| 2:14:11| Like I say, it's time to turn the page, and we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| I mean, that's my proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8053)|
| 2:14:14| Do we need to assign a time then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8054)|
| 2:14:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| Part of the motion would be to instruct Mr. Walls to be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8058)|
| 2:14:20| I mean, we're going May 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| At what time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8064)|
| 2:14:25| Right after the intergovernmental and financial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| Assuming we're going to meet jointly, it'll be right after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| And then also I'm suggesting we set aside May 20th, Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8071)|
| 2:14:34| in case we're not done and we have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8074)|
| 2:14:35| Shouldn't we allow time break for lunch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| Well, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8077)|
| 2:14:39| So then what time do you want to meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| Well, if we're done by 1030 or 11, we could go ahead and break for lunch then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8081)|
| 2:14:45| and come back at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8085)|
| 2:14:46| We'll have to see what time we break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| We might be able to get started and then have a break or even have lunch brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8088)|
| 2:14:53| I would suggest we have lunch brought in so we can work through lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8093)|
| 2:14:56| I think what we do is we decide that on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| It says, are we ready to go immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| or does the commission at that time want to take a recess and come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8101)|
| 2:15:08| I think that's the proper way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8108)|
| 2:15:10| Depending on how long those committee meetings last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8110)|
| 2:15:16| It would be helpful to get it done earlier so we know we've got other things to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8116)|
| 2:15:26| Now, I've got a question at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8126)|
| 2:15:28| Whenever you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| Well, while we're talking about that, Dwight, you might be able to answer this question or Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8131)|
| 2:15:39| The flow chart of your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8139)|
| 2:15:43| I've called code enforcement last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8143)|
| 2:15:45| and now I've been told that they've been moved under the Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8145)|
| 2:15:50| And, like, your title had changed since some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8150)|
| 2:15:55| But I believe that the administration is supposed to have a flow chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| And you cannot change that without a resolution of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8159)|
| 2:16:03| Can you tell me if you all have done that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8163)|
| 2:16:05| Mister, we haven't moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8165)|
| 2:16:06| There's been some misinformation about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8166)|
| 2:16:08| County codes has not been moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8168)|
| 2:16:11| Codes is a big umbrella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8171)|
| 2:16:12| It consists of building inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8172)|
| 2:16:14| Well, I'm talking about the three code enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| There are zoning enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8177)|
| 2:16:18| And, yes, sir, they are going to be moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8178)|
| 2:16:20| They're going to report to Grant Rosenberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8180)|
| 2:16:24| Just for the record and especially for the benefit of the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8184)|
| 2:16:28| because I think they've had some concerns about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8188)|
| 2:16:30| this wasn't done at the suggestion that there was something wrong or something broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8190)|
| 2:16:35| We're simply looking to marry that Office of Neighborhoods into codes and zoning more effectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8195)|
| 2:16:42| because that's typically where the calls come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| These three inspectors are not building inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8204)|
| 2:16:47| They handle things like non-permitted mobile homes, junk cars or abandoned cars, overgrown lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8207)|
| 2:16:54| things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| They get their calls really from two places primarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8216)|
| 2:16:59| one from the Office of Neighborhoods at the 215 Helpline and two from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8219)|
| 2:17:03| So we're going to marry them into the Office of Neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8223)|
| 2:17:06| and see if we can't track the incoming calls and the disposition of those calls better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8226)|
| 2:17:11| But it's certainly no reflection on the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| Well, that's to my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8234)|
| 2:17:15| Have you all asked the county commissioner, or do you think you have to, to restructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8235)|
| 2:17:20| Because your title has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8240)|
| 2:17:21| You're the chief administrative officer of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8241)|
| 2:17:24| You used to be the PR communication director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8244)|
| 2:17:29| I'd simply suggest to you, Commissioner, that I think all of this is the mayor's prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8249)|
| 2:17:33| He was elected to run the executive branch, and that's what he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8253)|
| 2:17:37| This is among the decisions that he makes every day as he governs Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8257)|
| 2:17:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8262)|
| 2:17:43| Does your pay change when you got a new title,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| or does anybody in the Office of Neighborhoods get a pay increase based on more workload| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8265)|
| 2:17:53| because they now have three code enforcement officers under them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| My pay did not change when I took on additional responsibility in the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8276)|
| 2:18:02| I don't think that Mr. Rosenberg's pay has changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8282)|
| 2:18:06| but I think that's certainly something that may be contemplated in the coming budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8286)|
| 2:18:09| And, again, I'd submit to you that is the mayor's prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8289)|
| 2:18:12| As long as it falls within the payroll system and the personnel plan of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8292)|
| 2:18:17| an adjustment may be in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8297)|
| 2:18:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8298)|
| 2:18:19| We need to keep these questions to the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8299)|
| 2:18:23| Can I ask Mr. Owens one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8303)|
| 2:18:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8305)|
| 2:18:26| Okay, Mr. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8306)|
| 2:18:27| Does the charter say that administration's any time restructuring of the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8307)|
| 2:18:32| is done by resolution of the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8312)|
| 2:18:35| It's the Knox County Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8315)|
| 2:18:36| What the Knox County Code provides is that the county mayor shall publish to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8316)|
| 2:18:45| an organization chart listing the departments and divisions of the executive branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8325)|
| 2:18:49| which shall be subject to approval by resolution of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8329)|
| 2:18:53| The county executive shall timely amend and republish the organization chart whenever there is a change in structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8333)|
| 2:19:02| and any such change shall be subject to approval by resolution of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8342)|
| 2:19:06| If you're taking codes administration out from under the director of public works and engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8346)|
| 2:19:12| and putting it under the senior director of community services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8352)|
| 2:19:15| you've made a substantial change in your organizational chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| and that requires commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8358)|
| 2:19:23| Again, we are moving three employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8363)|
| 2:19:26| We are not moving the codes department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8366)|
| 2:19:28| Three zoning inspectors from the codes department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8368)|
| 2:19:32| which will remain under the supervision of the director of engineering and public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8372)|
| 2:19:37| and having them report to the office of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8377)|
| 2:19:40| But we are not making any wholesale changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8380)|
| 2:19:43| We're not changing the fundamental organizational nature of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8383)|
| 2:19:49| We're simply giving three employees, who would not even be fairly characterized as middle management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8389)|
| 2:19:56| these are inspectors, a different supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8396)|
| 2:20:01| Well, you don't have a line connecting codes to the department of office of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8401)|
| 2:20:08| And, you know, it's been a long time, Dwight, since the administration amended its organizational chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8408)|
| 2:20:18| and you may want to take a look at it and see if you're in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8418)|
| 2:20:21| We'll be glad to, and we'll consult with you as we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8421)|
| 2:20:23| That's section 2-6-1 of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8423)|
| 2:20:26| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| I was going to bring up a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8428)|
| 2:20:30| I don't see what relevance this has to the audit, and also I'd like to go ahead and call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8430)|
| 2:20:35| Well, Mr. Briggs, it was brought up to my attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| this morning, and I meant to add it, but certainly if someone's in violation of the county charter or the county codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8437)|
| 2:20:43| we certainly need to make sure they're in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| I think that's fine, but we're right in the middle of the discussion of voting on when to have the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8445)|
| 2:20:49| I mean, I think if we can discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8449)|
| 2:20:51| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8451)|
| 2:20:52| We have a substitute motion on the floor to have the two hearings on application of mail-in finance on the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8452)|
| 2:21:03| Does everybody understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8463)|
| 2:21:04| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8464)|
| 2:21:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8465)|
| 2:21:06| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8466)|
| 2:21:07| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8467)|
| 2:21:15| I think 923 and 924, it was all combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8475)|
| 2:21:18| Is that correct, Commissioner Pinson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8478)|
| 2:21:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8480)|
| 2:21:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8481)|
| 2:21:22| We discussed them all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8482)|
| 2:21:23| Together, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8483)|
| 2:21:26| We're on ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8486)|
| 2:21:29| On page 29, ordinance 0-08-4-101 is an ordinance amending article 9, section 9.05 of the Knox County Charter to modify the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8489)|
| 2:21:39| Charter Review Committee process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8499)|
| 2:21:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8503)|
| 2:21:44| We have other resolutions that have been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8504)|
| 2:21:46| We still have two resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| I thought there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8508)|
| 2:21:52| 925, which is both committees meet together at 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8512)|
| 2:22:00| Whose resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8520)|
| 2:22:01| That's Pinson's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8521)|
| 2:22:02| And that's the act of separate committees that meet at the same time, but just like they did when we had the 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8522)|
| 2:22:08| but they're still separate committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8528)|
| 2:22:10| And anything that fails by both committees does not go to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8530)|
| 2:22:18| They'd be taken off the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8538)|
| 2:22:20| He said that's a separate resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8540)|
| 2:22:23| I think he got that as a separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8543)|
| 2:22:25| So we'll just have the first one on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8545)|
| 2:22:27| Oh, 926 is the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| If item fails, it will fall from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8549)|
| 2:22:32| So we need to just talk about the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8552)|
| 2:22:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8554)|
| 2:22:35| We do have another, 927, which is law directed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8555)|
| 2:22:38| I'll make a motion to approve 925 combining the meeting time for both committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8558)|
| 2:22:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8565)|
| 2:22:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| We understand what the resolution states, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8570)|

| 2:23:00| We'll meet on the 20, whatever it is, at 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8580)|
| 2:23:05| The 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8585)|
| 2:23:06| 19th at 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8586)|
| 2:23:07| So we wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8587)|
| 2:23:09| Yeah, 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8589)|
| 2:23:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8590)|
| 2:23:11| 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8591)|
| 2:23:12| So we wish to change our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8592)|
| 2:23:15| Is that right, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8595)|
| 2:23:17| So we'll need to revise the rules of commission to make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8597)|
| 2:23:22| Right now it has your meeting separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8602)|
| 2:23:25| Well, we're really just meeting at the same time, but each committee is going to be separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8605)|
| 2:23:30| We're going to vote just like it was when the 11 men, when we only had 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8610)|
| 2:23:35| We met, but we voted separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| You're making this a permanent feature of the county commission to meet together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8617)|
| 2:23:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8621)|
| 2:23:42| For now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8622)|
| 2:23:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8623)|
| 2:23:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8624)|
| 2:23:45| But for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8625)|
| 2:23:46| For now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8626)|
| 2:23:47| Of course, we may come back in a month or two and change it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| But for now, that's what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8631)|
| 2:23:52| We'll need to amend the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8632)|
| 2:23:53| I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8633)|
| 2:23:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8634)|
| 2:23:55| 926, which if items fail, it will fall from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8635)|
| 2:24:01| Do you want to elaborate on it, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8641)|
| 2:24:05| Well, what it is, you know, if both committees vote against something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8645)|
| 2:24:11| and it fails with the majority on both committees, there's no need for it to come here and us discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8651)|
| 2:24:17| when we already have the votes for it to fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8657)|
| 2:24:22| Can I get a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8662)|
| 2:24:24| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8664)|
| 2:24:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8665)|
| 2:24:30| Is this a proper motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8670)|
| 2:24:31| Who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8671)|
| 2:24:34| I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8674)|
| 2:24:35| Somebody seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8675)|
| 2:24:36| I'll make a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8676)|
| 2:24:37| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8677)|
| 2:24:39| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8679)|
| 2:24:42| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8682)|
| 2:24:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8683)|
| 2:24:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8684)|
| 2:24:45| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8685)|
| 2:24:46| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8686)|
| 2:24:48| 927 is now directed to draft a letter to Attorney General asking for clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8688)|
| 2:24:55| regarding appointment of school superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8695)|
| 2:24:59| Can I speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8699)|
| 2:25:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8700)|
| 2:25:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8701)|
| 2:25:02| Last month, I believe it was last month, I passed out an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8702)|
| 2:25:06| It was the County of Shelby versus Ned McWherter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8706)|
| 2:25:09| Now, this was Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| It was their Board of County Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8711)|
| 2:25:14| It was their school superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| It was their school board, all against Ned McWherter, the Governor of the State of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8716)|
| 2:25:25| against Riley Darnell, the Secretary of State, against Charles Burson, the Attorney General for the State of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8725)|
| 2:25:34| to answer the question of the constitutionality of the Educational Improvement Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8734)|
| 2:25:41| as it relates to who appoints, who elects the superintendent of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8741)|
| 2:25:53| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8753)|
| 2:25:55| The court found this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8755)|
| 2:26:00| This statute, which replaced the position of county superintendent of public instruction with the director of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8760)|
| 2:26:07| to be selected by local boards of education, did not violate constitutional section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8767)|
| 2:26:14| which is Article 11, Section 17 of the Tennessee Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8774)|
| 2:26:22| that it does not apply to the manner of selecting the director of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8782)|
| 2:26:27| But, basically, it did not violate that specific constitutional provision, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8787)|
| 2:26:34| providing that county offices must be elected by the people or county or county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8794)|
| 2:26:40| As a new position of director of schools would be a county employee, not a county officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8800)|
| 2:26:46| And the legislature could abolish legislatively created offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8806)|
| 2:26:51| So the school superintendent was a legislatively created office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8811)|
| 2:26:56| And so what the court found was that it could abolish the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8816)|
| 2:27:02| It could make it a position that is one that is filled by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8822)|
| 2:27:08| It outlined a number of provisions that should be within the superintendent's contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8828)|
| 2:27:17| You know, we talked about the contract a little bit earlier tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8837)|
| 2:27:20| The contract that basically the Education Improvement Act abolished the office of county superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8840)|
| 2:27:29| It authorized each local board of education to employ a director of schools in place of the county superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8849)|
| 2:27:37| It required all county boards of ed to be elected by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8857)|
| 2:27:41| It required the director of schools to be employed for up to four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8861)|
| 2:27:45| You saw a four-year contract tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| It required the director's actions to be consistent with school board policies, rules, and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8867)|
| 2:27:53| That's within the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8873)|
| 2:27:58| The question has been asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8878)|
| 2:28:00| It's been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8880)|
| 2:28:01| I mean, you're basically wishing for me to write a letter to the attorney general, who was a defendant in the very case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8881)|
| 2:28:11| and asking basically for an opinion that the attorney general defended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8891)|
| 2:28:20| The attorney general was pleased with the outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8900)|
| 2:28:24| It was basically contrary to the position taken by Shelby County, by their commission, by their board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8904)|
| 2:28:32| and by their superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| I think it's a total waste of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8914)|
| 2:28:37| I would ask that you not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8917)|
| 2:28:38| You may be correct on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8918)|
| 2:28:40| But, see, now that's the law you were going to get to me several months ago, and you've never gotten it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8920)|
| 2:28:44| Oh, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8924)|
| 2:28:45| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8925)|
| 2:28:46| Is it not the law that you said you would get it to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| I provided the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8928)|
| 2:28:51| How many commissioners received a copy of this opinion that I provided last month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8931)|
| 2:28:57| It was provided to each commissioner at the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8937)|
| 2:29:00| It may have gotten lost in your materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| Let me ask you this, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8942)|
| 2:29:04| You're saying they abolished the position of the superintendent of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8944)|
| 2:29:07| and created another position, basically, is what you're saying, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8947)|
| 2:29:11| Abolished the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8951)|
| 2:29:12| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8952)|
| 2:29:13| They abolished that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8953)|
| 2:29:14| Well, I can go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8954)|
| 2:29:16| But still yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8956)|
| 2:29:17| We have to go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8957)|
| 2:29:18| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8958)|
| 2:29:19| Now, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8959)|
| 2:29:20| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8960)|
| 2:29:22| We saw term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8962)|
| 2:29:24| One guy, attorney general down there, said we couldn't have term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8964)|
| 2:29:30| They sure did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8970)|
| 2:29:31| And then another one comes in and says, oh, yes, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8971)|
| 2:29:34| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8974)|
| 2:29:36| So, you know, that's when it went to the Supreme Court, more or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8976)|
| 2:29:38| We actually had two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8978)|
| 2:29:40| The attorney general for the state argued in the Bailey case, because I was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8980)|
| 2:29:45| argued that term limiting county commissioners was unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8985)|
| 2:29:50| I'm not going to ask you to mail that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| And they were wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8992)|
| 2:29:54| But what I'm going to say is that's two lawyers, and, you know, they differ every day in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8994)|
| 2:29:59| So if we send a letter down there, this one might say we're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=8999)|
| 2:30:03| But I'm not going to ask you to send the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9003)|
| 2:30:04| I think they have to follow this procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9004)|
| 2:30:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9006)|
| 2:30:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9008)|
| 2:30:09| Mr. Pinkston, do you want to withdraw this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9009)|
| 2:30:10| Thank God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9010)|
| 2:30:11| Unless you want to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9011)|
| 2:30:16| I'm going to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9018)|

| 2:31:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9065)|
| 2:31:08| What was the amendment, Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9068)|
| 2:31:12| It had to do with the actual makeup of the committee and the selection process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9072)|
| 2:31:16| that we do it similar to how the Ethics Committee is appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9076)|
| 2:31:20| that the mayor appoints a certain number and the commission appoints a certain number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9080)|
| 2:31:25| so that way it would be a balanced committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9085)|
| 2:31:27| And I believe also we would individually vote those people up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9087)|
| 2:31:34| I'd like to make a motion to approve with an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9094)|
| 2:31:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9097)|
| 2:31:38| It was amended in one committee and it wasn't in the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9098)|
| 2:31:40| and that's why you don't have the amendment in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9100)|
| 2:31:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9103)|
| 2:31:47| Commissioner Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9107)|
| 2:31:48| did this also address whether it would have to be brought back before commission before it was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9108)|
| 2:31:55| That was the original motion, and then the amendment had to do with the makeup of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9115)|
| 2:32:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9120)|
| 2:32:02| So it would be both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9122)|
| 2:32:05| Who seconded it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9125)|
| 2:32:08| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9128)|

| 2:32:29| What is the actual effect now on what we voted for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9149)|

| 2:32:41| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9161)|
| 2:32:42| With the amendment, I felt like the commission is going to put some, the mayor is going to put some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9162)|
| 2:32:49| and then we're going to hold a referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9169)|
| 2:32:51| But what about the timeline of getting this on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9171)|
| 2:32:55| We're getting ready to discuss that on mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9175)|
