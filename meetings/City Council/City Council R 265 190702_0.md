| 0:02:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| Or items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| Or items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| Seeing none, we have consent items, 11F, a certificate of compliance, and 11G through H, pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=148)|

| 0:02:43| The consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| For the mayor's report, I want to start by welcoming the new community engagement class from SEED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=165)|
| 0:02:52| They just joined us. Hello, Stan and all of the members of the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=172)|
| 0:02:57| We appreciate you all being here at our council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| Stan, did you purposely pick a very short agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| I always knew you were a smart guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| And we do appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| We'd be glad to talk to you afterwards if you've got any questions about what happened tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| I also want to invite everyone to come downtown on Thursday and celebrate the 4th of July with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=198)|
| 0:03:25| The festival on the 4th will go from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. on the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| As always, there will be a wide variety of live music, family-friendly activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| and of course the city's largest firework display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| You can go to KnoxvilleTN.gov slash 4th, number 4-T-H, 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=219)|
| 0:03:47| or KnoxvilleTN.gov slash news to get all of the details on the performance lineup, where to park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=227)|
| 0:03:55| what streets are closed, and the do's and don'ts on what you can bring into the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| For example, you are welcome to bring chairs and blankets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| but you cannot bring coolers, alcohol, pop-up tents, or pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| The finale starts at 8 p.m. with the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra's 35th annual free Pilot Flying J Independence Day concert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=247)|
| 0:04:15| featuring KSO music director Aram Demirjian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=255)|
| 0:04:21| I said that right, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| The fireworks are scheduled during the conclusion of the concert, which will start about 9.35 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| So while you're at the festival on the 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| be sure and take note of the newly renovated performance lawn at the south end of the World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| where the concert will be held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| Thursday's festival will be the first event on the new lawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| In fact, we'll have a ribbon-cutting tomorrow at 2 o'clock to recognize the improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| I want to thank Council for supporting this $2.5 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| The construction team has updated the site's water and electric service, improved the drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| If you remember, it always seemed to rain right before the 4th of July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| and we'd be in puddles watching the symphony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| So that should not happen anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| We've added new sod, pervious pavers, and an enlarged entry area and gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| So the performance lawn and the greenway that borders it have been closed to the public since January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| in order to accommodate the work on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| So there's still some finishing work that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| So after Festival on the 4th, there'll be a short-term closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| so we can do the final completions on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| But come on down and enjoy the 4th of July and see our new lawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| So remember also that city offices, parks and recreation centers, and indoor pools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| are closed Thursday in celebration of the 4th of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| Outdoor pools will be open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| and then resume normal schedules on Friday, July 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| The Cecil Webb Recreation Center in South Knoxville will be closed Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| and the West Haven Recreation Center will be closed the full week through July 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| Also, we want to make sure y'all are aware that the U.S. Small Business Administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| is making its disaster loan program available in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| and 18 other counties that are recovering from the severe flooding last February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| Loans up to $200,000 are available to homeowners to repair or replace damaged property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| Homeowners and renters are eligible for loans up to $40,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| to repair or replace personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| SBA customer service representatives met with affected property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| over seven days' time at Central High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| and helped with applications for low-interest disaster loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| The last meeting was today, but the deadline to file an application isn't until August 20th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| so there's still plenty of time to get your application in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| Information is available on the state of Tennessee and city of Knoxville websites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=418)|
| 0:07:04| also at disasterloan.sba.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=424)|
| 0:07:12| If you didn't catch that, call 311 and we'll be glad to get the information to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| You can also call the SBA Customer Service Center at 1-800-659-2955.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=437)|
| 0:07:25| Also, there's two other things I want to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| One, Councilman Campin asked for an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=449)|
| 0:07:35| Two weeks ago, folks from Oakland-Lincoln Park came to talk some more about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=455)|
| 0:07:42| Fort Lowndes Waste and Recycling site, and I know they're here tonight and have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| I do want to tell you that David Brace has been working with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=467)|
| 0:07:54| and fire department and inspections to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| He's actually drafted a pretty thorough email that will be sent to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| He's not here tonight because of a family obligation, and he's not had good cell service all day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=486)|
| 0:08:13| so the email is not completed yet, but it should go out in the next day or two to Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| and, of course, to the neighborhood that can give you an update on what all these departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| have been doing to try and address the concerns of that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| and respond to the neighbors who will hear, and I know we'll hear more from them tonight as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| But I wanted you to know that representatives have been meeting with the owners of the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| and the fire marshal's office and inspections and neighborhood codes have been on site almost daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=519)|
| 0:08:46| to review the progress at that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| So a more thorough draft when this is completed will be sent to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| Councilman Campin, and also I passed out to you all and anybody in the audience who would like it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=536)|
| 0:09:06| we've got some extra copies I think, but I just want to go over where we are on recode Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| and the upcoming city council meetings just to remind everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| So the recode zoning ordinance, which is draft five as amended by Council and the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=555)|
| 0:09:22| will be on the Tuesday, July 16, 2019 agenda of the regularly scheduled city council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=562)|
| 0:09:30| that begins at 6 p.m., so two weeks from tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| As you will recall, the proposed ordinance has been discussed and amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| at special called council meetings on May 14th and May 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| and then postponed for about six and a half weeks to the July 16th meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| in order to give plenty of time for public review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| The ordinance was also amended, you all voted to send it back to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| and they amended and approved it again at their June 13th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| So then during the month of June, council members met one-on-one with Planning Executive Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| Gerald Green to review and submit your comments and proposed revisions to draft four of the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=606)|
| 0:10:14| So remember, there's the text of the document and there's the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| For anything to go into effect, both of them have to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| So for the next meeting in two weeks, this is what I recommend we do when we get to that item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| First is to review the text of the zoning document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| To review the updated worksheet of council-initiated revisions and take action as appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=634)|
| 0:10:40| Any change we are documenting in these worksheets that our law department is managing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=640)|
| 0:10:50| so we want to go through, you will get a copy of the latest of the council-initiated revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=650)|
| 0:10:59| And then also we have the staff-initiated revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| We've already done a lot of work on both of these worksheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| So anybody who cares and is following can see clearly any changes that are made and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=666)|
| 0:11:15| Then we'll review the Planning Commission's June 13th amendments and take action as appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| And then if council is ready to vote on the text of the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| someone can make a motion to approve the zoning ordinance as amended on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| But again, remember that you can vote for the zoning map and the text of the document separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=689)|
| 0:11:37| but nothing goes into effect until they are both approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| And then what I suggest is that we start talking about the zoning map, which is draft 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=702)|
| 0:11:49| and first hear a general review of draft 4, the zoning map, by Gerald Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| And then review and take action as appropriate on proposed revisions to the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| as recommended by council members and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| I know Councilwoman Ryder had some suggestions after meeting with her constituents on some changes to the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=724)|
| 0:12:13| And if anybody else has those, then you can bring them up at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| But if you can get them to us ahead of time, it helps and means that we can give advance notice to folks about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| and post it online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| We'll also have an interactive map that shows the current zones and then the proposed revisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| so you can see side-by-side in the context of what those proposed revisions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| And of course, any additional revisions could also be proposed by council or discussed by the public who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| At that time, after we do that, we'll see how long all that takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| You can decide what additional information you might need or whether additional information is needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=770)|
| 0:12:57| to finalize and start taking action on the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| So after the July 16th council meeting, the next opportunity for council to review, amend, and vote on recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=780)|
| 0:13:08| is two weeks later at the July 30th regularly scheduled council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| We previously announced that back on May 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| And then also we announced that we are holding two dates in August for special call meetings, if those are necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=796)|
| 0:13:24| Monday, August 5th and Monday, August 12th, both starting at 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| Are there any questions from council on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| Does that sound reasonable to you to proceed in that way at our next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| Also, at the bottom of this two-pager, just reminding that all of this information is on the RecodeKnoxville.com website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=819)|
| 0:13:50| The ordinance as amended by council and the Planning Commission can be found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| You go to RecodeKnoxville.com and on that first page, the landing page, you can click to the current version of Draft 5 as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=834)|
| 0:14:04| The worksheets that our law department is tracking, all the revisions are also online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=844)|
| 0:14:11| And as we get closer to when the agenda packet goes out July 9th, they will be updated in that packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=851)|
| 0:14:20| Draft 4 of the zoning map also is online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| You can look at what it looks like right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| And also added to the website, and I think council received this, is a summary, a Recode zoning chart summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=868)|
| 0:14:37| that shows that although the names of some of the zones have changed, that the uses of those zones have largely stayed the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=877)|
| 0:14:49| And there's a nice graphic chart of all of these different zone classifications and the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=889)|
| 0:14:56| So we're trying to get all this information out on the website so it's very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| And if there's information that anybody needs that they don't see on the website, please let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=903)|
| 0:15:09| Also, council should have received this afternoon in your email, frequently asked questions about Recode Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=909)|
| 0:15:17| some of the stuff that you have told us you've been asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| And so here are some answers to those frequently asked questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| This will also be posted on the RecodeKnoxville.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| So review those, and if you've got more questions you want answered, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| So that is my update on Recode, and that is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=935)|
| 0:15:42| So any reports of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| Seeing none, we'll move on to ordinances on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| 9A is an ordinance to amend the Knox City Code, Chapter 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| to clarify flooding regulations and remove certain unnecessary language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| Director Hagerman, I just had a couple questions on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| It's my understanding the city's used a 500-year standard for this flood plan since the 1970s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| Are we seeing any kind of change here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| Jim Hagerman, director of engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| We've been using the 500-year or .2% probability flood since the 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=985)|
| 0:16:33| I don't know who had the foresight to do that, but it was a good thing to have started that early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=993)|
| 0:16:45| So there is no real change here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| The biggest change is just clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| They've started drawing the map somewhat differently, just using different codes on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1011)|
| 0:16:58| So you will see if you look through here, a lot of the red-lined stuff that's been added, it says shaded X zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1018)|
| 0:17:11| That's because they started using two different X zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| One of them is shaded, which is the 500-year flood zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| and then there's another X zone that's not shaded, that's everything out of the regulatory flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| So it's really ambiguous on the map, and that's the only way we could clarify it in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1047)|
| 0:17:35| But the map is not something that the city draws up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| This is something FEMA draws up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| And there is no change, other than what you just mentioned, really, structurally on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| There's no change in the way we administer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| It's just a matter of clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| And it looked in the text like we're replacing the 500-year event or the 100-year event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| which is really saying that in one, I guess you have a chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| one chance in 500 every year of seeing a flood at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| And so it's clarifying it by making that a percentage of 0.2% as opposed to the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| Stating it as a probability instead of a recurrence interval, as we say in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Thank you, Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Those have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| 9B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 5, Article 4, Section 5-107| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| to reduce administrative costs and procedures for domesticated chicken permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents to convey property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| including a quit-claim deed, to Aplos Home LLC for two parcels of property located at 3738 and 3740 Speedway Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1135)|
| 0:19:03| Parcel ID numbers 082DD030 and 081DD031, within the limits of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1143)|
| 0:19:13| pursuant to the Homemakers Program, for a contract sales price of $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Yeah, I just wanted to ask Becky, Ms. Wade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| interesting house, very interesting architectural house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| I just kind of wanted to know what's the story on that house or the short story on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| Well, that house is called the Nafl House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| It was originally built on Gay Street and moved when the hotel was built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1176)|
| 0:19:44| Andrew Johnson Hotel, and it was moved out to Speedway Circle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| which just ceased to be a racetrack at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| So, yes, it's a very unusual structure for the neighborhood or for anywhere in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| There's not much of the original left other than the front façade, the stone façade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1201)|
| 0:20:09| and the purchasers of this property will be investing quite a lot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| to stabilize, completely renovate this structure into a four-bedroom home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| which will be affordable rental property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| Will it be a fourplex or will it be a single-family house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| No, no, it's a single-family, four-bedroom house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| Single-family, four-bedroom house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Well, that's a pretty neat house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| Yeah, we're very happy to have somebody interested and with the means to take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| Would that have an H1 overlay on it at all or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| It doesn't at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| It doesn't at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1247)|

| 0:20:58| for an amount not to exceed $362,375 for design of Phase II of the Northwest Greenway Connector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1258)|
| 0:21:06| Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1266)|

| 0:22:24| So, Council, we are now at a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| We do have five people who have signed up, starting with Greg Doofy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| Thank you for being here and you know the routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| Keep an eye on the timer there and please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| Greg Doofy, Plymouth Avenue in East Knoxville, but I'm also involved with Westview Neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1359)|
| 0:22:48| I really missed being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| You probably wondered where I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| I don't know if anyone missed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| I was getting cheese and taking care of family in Wisconsin and that took a little bit of priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| A couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| One, could we get some help with Hillwood Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| That connects Island Home to James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| If you haven't been over there, that's in the neighborhood that Mr. Brace lives in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| I'm sure he and others are familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| It's a very treacherous street with a deep drop-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| I've got my tire off it before in my truck and bottomed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| I hope in future plans for improving our streets, which you do a great job with and it's never-ending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| that we could put Hillwood, even though I don't live there, I care about all neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| we could get that street fixed in a good way and widened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| That would be awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| Recently, most of you know I've spent most of my time talking about cemeteries here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1427)|
| 0:23:54| I'll briefly mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| We had a meeting with Renee Kessler at the Beck Cultural Exchange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| By we, I mean Holly Cox from Knox Heritage and Ellen Adcox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| So we're kind of partnering and working with them to get some advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| They've done some work with the other Odd Fellows Cemetery in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| which the city has also helped with in the past through Mr. Brace and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| So we're real excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| I wanted to also compliment those without throwing anyone under the bus or identifying anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1464)|
| 0:24:32| There was a good number of city council members and other individuals that sit up on this platform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1472)|
| 0:24:40| I'll just say that, who were supportive of the Pride March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| For me, going down there hoping to see a blockade by maybe some people that have been in the news lately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1484)|
| 0:24:53| I didn't get to see that, but what I got to see is city council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| and city employees supporting maybe not Pride as much as they were supporting marginalized groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1498)|
| 0:25:06| because that's really what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| People of color, et cetera, are marginalized groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| I happen to be in a privileged status as a white male with some gray hair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| but it's really nice to see the city supporting events like Pride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| and I hope in our future mayors will have that support as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| I'm not going to talk about recode except, Mayor, I appreciate all the work since the last time I was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| all the transparency tonight and the thorough efforts and details and time involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| I know there's been a lot of fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| What I would do is challenge everyone in this city to be involved with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| Use the electronic media and sites that the city set up and come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1550)|
| 0:25:57| This place should be packed every week with people who are here to compliment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| and offer suggestions to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| I've found that it's better to compliment and ask for help than to come down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| and alienate people by screaming at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| Along that line, you have wonderful city council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| Use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| Use your neighborhood associations and use 311 like I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| to get things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| The last thing that I want to mention are the recent mayoral candidate forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| I've got about a minute for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| I've attended a few of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| I've reached out to a few of the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| Some of those folks have not been able to keep promises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| so I was a little bit concerned with the promises they gave me without identifying them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| and I wonder about the future of this city if those candidates can't keep the promises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| before they get in office if they're going to keep them after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| So I'm still interviewing mayoral candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| I hope we get one that's close to as good or even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| I'm wishing for better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| A great job you've done, Mayor, and thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| I've given up my 20 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| Thank you, Mr. Duesing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| Next we have Michelle Ivester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1640)|
| 0:27:30| And then followed by Amanda Burns, Wes Reitenbach, and Tammy Garland, if you want to be prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| Thank you for being here tonight, and please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| I'm Michelle Ivester, 1131 Chickamauga Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| We're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| We were here a couple weeks ago about the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| Since then, Mr. Camden has been good enough to meet with us one afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| Unfortunately, nobody from the city apparently was able to come as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| But there are still concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| Trailers are still coming in daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| Neighbors are now complaining that they're doing it overnight hours, so that's disturbing people's sleep again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1681)|
| 0:28:08| I've also heard through the grapevine that they have a couple new clients, which is concerning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| considering they're supposed to not be doing any type of business at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| We were relieved to see that they finally have the permit for the demolition, so that went up yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| and we appreciate that, but we are still needing answers, and we're not getting any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1705)|
| 0:28:31| They put on a really good show the other day when we were out at the walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| Especially about the last ten minutes, they backed up a truck to a big pile of trash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| and had a forklift out there and a couple of guys even in hard hats, and that lasted all of about ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1720)|
| 0:28:47| And as we were walking away, everybody dispersed, and they were gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| So it's very disheartening to see that it's continuing to, their business is continuing on as usual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1732)|
| 0:29:02| and the neighbors are very dismayed, and we're still asking for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| So I will let other neighbors speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Amanda Burns, thank you for being here, and please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| Amanda Burns, Harvey Street in the Oakwood-Lincoln Park community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| First of all, I do want to thank the fire chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| You guys did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| As a member and a homeowner of a house in the Oakwood-Lincoln Park community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| I'd like to voice my displeasure regarding the inaction the city has taken so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| regarding the Fort Lowndon Recycling Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| As you know, the center has been noncompliant regarding past OSHA violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| which predicted a fire would occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| Then a fire did occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| Since that time, our community has discovered that not only was the facility noncompliant with OSHA fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| they have outstanding city code violations, outstanding city and county taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| plus they have been operating without a valid business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| A perfect storm of neglect and lack of oversight has occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| and resulted in a fire that pumped toxic black smoke into much of North Knoxville for two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1820)|
| 0:30:27| Our community was told that the business was a total loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| They had been ordered to refrain from bringing new materials to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| Site cleanup would start immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| Site cleanup has not started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| New materials are being brought in daily, and here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| The community rallies and begins documentation, videoing, taking photographs daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1846)|
| 0:30:57| I personally witness the pile of cardboard grow and grow and grow every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| I'm on Harvey Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| If you drive to the end of the street, you can see directly into the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| After the fire, it's this tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| Today, it's 30 feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| I've shared photographs before, after, and the weeks following the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1876)|
| 0:31:25| As our community has turned some of this documentation over to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| I understand that we were told it was not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1891)|
| 0:31:38| As I leave my home every day on Harvey Street, my gaze is drawn to the ever-growing landfill at the end of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1898)|
| 0:31:45| Yes, I said landfill because that's what the site is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| That's what it's become.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| That's what it continues to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| When we present this evidence, we're told it's not good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| We're not believable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| Yet the lies that the business owners have told the city are taken as honest and true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| which is very disheartening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| They have been allowed to skirt taxes, fines, and any oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1930)|
| 0:32:17| A city representative came to our community meeting, and I'm not going to call them out by name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| but they tell us that nothing can be done because we have a constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| I found that very insulting to every citizen that came to that meeting that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1949)|
| 0:32:37| Do not insult our intelligence or our knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| Nothing that happened has anything to do with the constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| There's nothing constitutional about black poisonous smoke being pumped into our air and into our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1966)|
| 0:32:57| Your purpose is to serve the public, protect the public, and behave in the best interest of the residents here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1977)|
| 0:33:06| The city has a long list of rules, principles that are supposed to be followed by both residents and businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| Our community expects action, not tomorrow, not next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| not at the end of the next 30 days that you give these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| We expect action now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| Wes Breitenbach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| Please state your name and address for the record, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| Wes Breitenbach, 726 Chickamauga Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| Mark made it out to see the site, lay eyes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| He invited everybody that I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| He had sent some notices out, let people know that it was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| Nobody else showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| People were busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| I was going to take some pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| I've been taking pictures of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| I also want to address North Road because that's the road that actually goes right in front of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| Some people think it's an alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| It's actually a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| I wasn't going to spend money developing pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| I thought maybe it would be better to take you on a virtual tour of North Street or Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2046)|
| 0:34:19| So this is just a bunch of junk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| Just some cardboard, some trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| You know, stuff people have laying all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| Just garbage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2065)|
| 0:34:32| That's like two feet of North Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| That was 15 seconds of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2076)|
| 0:35:01| We've had three months of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| We shouldn't be here begging you to do what you are elected to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2106)|
| 0:35:13| If any of you plan on furthering your careers, I assume you stand up off of your hands and do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2113)|
| 0:35:20| This is going to follow you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| What you do about this incident is going to follow you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| Because the residents of Oak and Lincoln Park aren't going to forget about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| Move to Boise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| One of us are going to send an email over to Boise and let them know how you handled this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| It's not going away until you do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| We're not going away until you do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| North Street is a dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| There are vehicles parked in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| There's equipment stored there on trailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| There's tires full of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| If you go to North Street, if you've ever been there, there's a trailer right on the inside of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2155)|
| 0:36:02| I'm not going to call it a business because they don't have a license, the North dump over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| It's a trailer full of tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| It's not labeled tires, and I don't think that they're authorized to store a trailer full of tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| There's bundles of debris on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| There's a trailer that's dumping markers that's been there for over a year with a piece of cardboard patching a hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2181)|
| 0:36:30| I can see it from the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| It really is sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| Congratulations on your new lawn for Fourth of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| There's people in Oakwood and Lincoln Park that would love some grass that they could go play in in their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| They can't because people suggested they shouldn't do that in their own yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| Enjoy your fireworks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| It's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| We have a new lawn downtown when we have residents that did nothing and can't go use their lawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2213)|
| 0:37:01| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| I just never thought it would be this difficult to enforce ordinance and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2223)|
| 0:37:09| You have a list of ordinances and regulations, but you have no consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| And so why would they do anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| I like to keep my yard clean because I'm a decent person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| I like my neighbors to drive by and go, hey, we like that guy living here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| The neighborhood doesn't want them here anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| And we have asked you time and time again to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| Thanks for the email that you've almost sent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| Yay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| We've almost got an answer three months later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| Maybe when David makes it back, whatever's going on with him, he might get around to send us an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| I don't know why it's taken this long to almost get an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| We almost got an email, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Hey, we almost got an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| That's government working, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| You guys came to see how government works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| We almost got an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| We had a toxic fire in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| People had to evacuate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| I had my business closed for two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| Mr. Breitenbach, your goal is to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| We almost got an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| Appreciate that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Tammy Garland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| Is Tammy Garland here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2297)|
| 0:38:28| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2308)|

| 0:38:32| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| If you pull that down, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| Yeah, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| Yes, my name is Tammy Garland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| I live at 438 Chickamauga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| And, you know, I, as well, with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2325)|
| 0:38:53| have been dealing with the toxic fumes, you know, of the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| You know, when it first started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| it pretty much engulfed the 400 block of Chickamauga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2342)|
| 0:39:10| I was actually afraid to stop a block at the 300 block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2350)|
| 0:39:19| because I was afraid to drive down a block to my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| because of the ash that was falling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| And I called my sister here and told her what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| I was able to get home within an hour when the fire started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| to shut my windows and stuff that was left open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| And we had ash inside of our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| And I spent the day with an engineer, State Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2389)|
| 0:39:56| My insurance company has been awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| And thank you, Mayor, you know, Rojera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| I think you've done an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| I never knew the facility was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| And, you know, so I can't complain about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| But my house has been pretty much condemned with the soot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2413)|
| 0:40:20| and the toxic fumes that got trapped into the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| We evacuated for five days because of an odorless gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2425)|
| 0:40:32| that we could not breathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| And the engineer that came out to my house today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| found outside my house that came from my gutters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| because we had ash and debris on the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| We were so blessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| But asbestos was found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| That's my concern, and that's why I'm here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| And we all know about asbestos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| I have the asbestos right here along with a lot of charred material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2471)|
| 0:41:19| that was found on top of my roof and at the bottom of my gutters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2479)|
| 0:41:30| with all the rain that has been washed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| And they have been sent off to a lab for analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2494)|
| 0:41:41| but this is confirmed to be asbestos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| My sister has asthma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| Her asthma has gone from six all the way down to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2510)|
| 0:41:57| So that's a serious health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| I'm having health issues because my bedroom is ground zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| because that's where we found ash in the bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2527)|
| 0:42:15| And I'm thankful my house didn't catch on fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| because if you look out my bedroom window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| I am a 90-degree angle to the plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2545)|
| 0:42:33| And I hope that, you know, something can be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2553)|
| 0:42:42| because if my house was affected that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| I'm concerned about the groundwater, the environmental issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2565)|
| 0:42:52| and the renters in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| And I've talked to several of the renters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| and they have no idea why they're taking their children to the ER once a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2579)|
| 0:43:08| because they can't breathe with chest pains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| And I wish there could be more education out there for the renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| You know, their landlords are getting the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| and collecting their insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| But let's look at the little person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| And, you know, I'm a retired educator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| and I've always took care of the little people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| And thank you for listening to me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| And I'm terrified that asbestos was found in my house and on my house today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2628)|
| 0:43:57| And I hope that's all they find because of the toxins that were in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2637)|
| 0:44:05| And I know I'm running out of time, but, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| we need to know the truth about the groundwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2650)|
| 0:44:17| And what was really in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| My degree was in ornamental horticulture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| And I know a lot about pesticides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| And from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2672)|
| 0:44:40| what happened back on May the 1st was more than just an environmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2680)|
| 0:44:51| It was a tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| It was a global tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| I'm going to need to have to cut off public forum now, your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| but I'd be glad to talk to you afterwards, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| So, council, that is the last person signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| So, if there's no other business, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| Music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190702?start=2710)|
