| 0:05:07| you all passed on second reading the changes to our public assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| facilities, which I appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| We made that really a greater management oversight under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| administration and turned the board into an advisory board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| and appreciate your confidence in us in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| That meant we had a person, a director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| actually replacing Bob Polk, as we all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=332)|

| 0:05:45| assembly's facilities director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| Greg, why don't you come on down just so folks can see you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| Greg, as public assembly facilities director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| will be reporting directly to Deputy to the Mayor and COO Eddie Maness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| And you all know, Greg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| he has an outstanding work record with the Election Commission over many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| years, and prior to that as a realtor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=365)|

| 0:06:28| We'll get to work on that, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| Well, thank you, Greg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| We really appreciate you being with us and look forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| Another thing we announced this past week was the reformation of the Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| Waste Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| And thanks to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| you all made some really excellent recommendations from members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| Green Waste Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| You all know that's been around for some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| but it had kind of gone on a hiatus over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| And we hired our new parks and green waste coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| Lori, who's back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| You can stand up, Lori.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| And so they put together from your recommendations a really great list that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| I appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| And I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| any of the members of the Green Waste Commission here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| Well, Jim Hagerman is because we also have some of our department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| But it's outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| I'm not going to list all the names because it's a long list because there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| so many members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| But it's an outstanding list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| And we attached their bios and those are on the website, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| the city website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| So I think we've got a really good group of folks that will be keeping Joe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| Walsh and Lori and me on the ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| And Christy, all of us working hard to keep our commitment up to developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| our green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| Thanks, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| Is there an identified chair for that commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| Under my ordinance, the group elects their own chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| So once they meet, we've got a meeting scheduled February 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| And so they will get to know each other and select their own chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| So we appreciate them being willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| Also, I understand we have some folks from Nature's Way again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| Let's see, if you're a student at Nature's Way Montessori School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| please stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=502)|

| 0:08:36| Each of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| Claire Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| Addison Cable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=523)|

| 0:08:47| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| Very nice to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| I understand they're going to write about this meeting for the school newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| So everybody be on your best behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| That's what they're going to write about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| Pass out the no-dos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| Anyway, I hope you find this an interesting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| We're glad to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| I also want to let you all know that the fire department will be holding its graduation of our 2013 recruit class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=550)|
| 0:09:23| It is tomorrow at 6 p.m. at the Civic Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| So we are excited about our new recruits, and we congratulate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| We all know the role that our firefighters do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| Unfortunately, we just saw just last week the risk that our firefighters take when there was a house fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=576)|
| 0:09:44| and our senior firefighter, Chris Medley, had to go in there and rescue somebody who was afraid, and he had to bring him out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=584)|
| 0:09:54| So Chris Medley, I spoke with him over the weekend, and he seemed to be in good spirits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| He had some burns that's been reported in the paper, some burns on his ears and on his neck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| and he seemed in very good spirits when I spoke to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| And so we certainly appreciate his courage and the work that he did for the city in saving the families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=609)|
| 0:10:19| And also I look forward then to welcoming our new recruits to a really excellent fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=619)|
| 0:10:26| And thank you for your leadership, Sam, for that, Chief Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| And I think that is all of my reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| Now on to council reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| Speaking of the fire department, I want to offer a special commendation to the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| Unfortunately, on January the 12th, Sunday, January the 12th, there was a fire in my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| about six doors down from my home, and the fire department made a very prompt response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| and an incredible effort to extinguish this fire, led by Assistant Chief Fowler and Assistant Chief Victor Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=658)|
| 0:11:07| Unbelievable service rendered by Chaplain Paul Trumpore, if I got that correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| in helping the homeowner, owner of the former property, kind of work through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=673)|
| 0:11:23| Engines 5, 12, and 18 responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| Ladder engine 20 and the hazmat unit 18 responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| It was unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| Unfortunately, the fire was a very difficult fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| and ultimately the public service department was involved to, with the backhoe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| pull a part of the house down so they could actually extinguish the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| The Knoxville Police Department also responded with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| and provided safety while the firefighters, in fact, performed their duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| It was an incredible effort on the part of our city services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| and I wanted to make sure that people knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| In addition, the Red Cross came to render any assistance they might to the homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| So it was an incredible display of very professional service on the part of our fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| and Chief Sharp and certainly our police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| So thank you, and I really wanted to make that public statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| I have a couple of announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| First, I wanted to announce that in my district there's going to be a major sewer project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=746)|
| 0:12:32| and it has to do with Lions View Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| And KUB is holding a public meeting on Thursday, January 24th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| at Sacred Heart Cathedral School in the library from 6 to 730,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| where they will be making a presentation of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| The project actually is one of the decree items that has to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| and it has to be done by the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| And it will entail possibly the closing of Lions View Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| so it's going to affect a lot of people in the west who travel Lions View into town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| because it's going to put quite a burden on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| But KUB did want me to announce that they're interested in the input from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=790)|
| 0:13:16| not only those folks that are going to be living on or the folks that are living on Lions View Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| but also the folks that use that roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| So that will be Thursday, January 24th, Sacred Heart School on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| I also wanted to announce that the assigned task force that we just once again postponed for another several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=807)|
| 0:13:34| I might say, we have our meeting tomorrow at 4 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| and I hope to be able to announce to Council within the next couple of meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| that we're getting to a point where we're going to have a couple more public input meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| and we'll be announcing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| But the meeting will be tomorrow at 4 o'clock at KCDC on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| So thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| Any other reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| Ms. Mitchell, we're on to 11E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=841)|

| 0:14:11| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| Thank you, Mayor, once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| I had mentioned to you folks at our last council meeting of the passing of Bruce McCarty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| and it's with great pride and honor that we've introduced a resolution which council will vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=858)|
| 0:14:26| But I wanted to say that the McCarty family is here, Bruce's wife, Elizabeth, and Doug and Hayes and Sarah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=866)|
| 0:14:34| The whole family is here along with, I believe, some grandchildren and then also people from the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| And I would like, if it's okay, Mayor, to read the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| Whereas Bruce McCarty, F-A-I-A, passed away on January 5, 2013, at the age of 92,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=887)|

| 0:18:29| And so it's been a tough first week and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1109)|

| 0:18:52| And I was ten minutes late to the meeting, so I missed the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1132)|

| 0:20:32| 9A is an ordinance amending Chapter 8, Article 5 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| by adding a new section authorizing the city court clerk to enter into a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| with a collection agency to collect fines and costs assessed by the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Councilman Dellavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| I think this is a good idea to have a backup system whereby we pursue sort of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| deadbeats not paying their fines and court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| I wonder, as we look at, what is that, Section 1D, which is on, maybe it's Section, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1259)|
| 0:21:06| Section 1D of this proposed ordinance, Section 8 of the statute on page 29,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| whether that amount that says not exceeding 40% of the total sum collected doesn't seem a little high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1271)|
| 0:21:18| And I realize that the state statute uses 40% as the ceiling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| but I sure hope we'd be down more like about 25% or 30% instead of 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| I realize it's not mandatory that we do it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| But, Jim York, maybe you can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| It just seems like we're making that awfully profitable for somebody and leaving the city out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| So tell us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| Jim York, finance director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| This does not require us to do the 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| We would be soliciting proposals from various firms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| and we will take the most advantageous firm for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| And I expect that the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| So you're going to have an RFP out there that says, please come and ask if you want to do our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| Tell us how you'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| The second, I can understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| I kind of wish it was lower, but I understand that we're not going to look for the highest one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| The second aspect, and it's probably addressed to Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| the state statutes, section 40-24-105, provides at least for state fines, court costs, and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1337)|
| 0:22:25| that if you don't pay your bill, they can take your driver's license, which is kind of a good whack upside the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| I realize it talks, the language is that if you have not paid all litigation, taxes, court costs, and fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1351)|
| 0:22:38| as a result of a disposition of an offense under the criminal laws of the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| and, of course, we have municipal laws that we're enforcing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| I didn't know if there was any hope that we could maybe get them to say or of any charter municipality after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1367)|
| 0:22:53| so that we could, you know, maybe have that statute amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| I realize that might be a reach, but it certainly would be a wonderful tool that would be less expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| Mr. York is going to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| I think we would agree to that, but I don't think that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| Not in the cards, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| We currently do turn over all uncollected moving violations that go unpaid to the state for suspension of license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1389)|
| 0:23:19| We still have a large number of people that are not paying despite that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1399)|
| 0:23:26| They don't want a license either, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| Does that deprive them of their insurance when they don't have a driver's license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| I can't speak to that, but we do know that there are quite a few people that are driving on suspended licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1413)|
| 0:23:40| Okay, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1420)|

| 0:25:37| Are you here, Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| Hello, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Please come down and state your name and address for the record, and according to council rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| My name is Darryl Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| This is my daughter, Wendy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| I live at 5448 Yosemite Trail, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| I own the home at 3216 Sutherland Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, and my daughter resides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| in that home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| The thing that I come to before council tonight is the project for multiple family housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1570)|
| 0:26:18| there on the lot next to the Dollar General store on Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| And what we have now in that area, my concern is the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1582)|
| 0:26:30| That has been a concern for the residential area on Sutherland for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| But the concern for the traffic is not in the common term of red lights, turn lanes, posted speeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1596)|
| 0:26:45| I want to express my grave concern for the ten homes between Belle Meade and Tober Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1605)|
| 0:26:52| Out of those ten homes, seven of those residents are forced to back into Sutherland in front of oncoming traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1612)|
| 0:27:05| And to give you some thought of that, it's almost like backing into an area off of John Severe Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1625)|
| 0:27:12| That's what it's like except for the speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| At this time, we have ten homes, as I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| Seven of these residents are forced to back out of the driveways into oncoming traffic onto Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| We now have many businesses that utilize numerous vehicles in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| The home at 3216 sits directly across from AAA Cooper Terminal, the truck lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| When that truck lines was first moved there in 1961, it was a super service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1659)|
| 0:27:46| They ran six trucks in a 24-hour period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| This terminal is utilizing more trucks than super service, I can assure you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| In addition to those, we have the CAT line there, the Knoxville Transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| We have numerous buses going to West High School and Pond Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| There at Tobler Lane, there is a turn lane and a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| And that turn lane will hold four cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| But the multiple family housing that's on the hill there does not come out at the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| It comes out onto Sutherland between the trucking terminal and Tobler Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| Therefore, those ten homes sit directly in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| If you get some kind of break from the red light itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| then the people coming from up on the top of that hill up from those apartment complexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| they come into Sutherland and Groves, I mean, just immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| And my daughter and I, when I'm visiting her, we do have to back out into that, and it is a nightmare, let me assure you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1725)|
| 0:28:54| What I would like to ask council to do before we approve the final to build the multiple family housing there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1734)|
| 0:29:06| is to ask city traffic engineers to do a complete study of what's going on in that area between Belmead and Tobler Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1746)|
| 0:29:17| and to just check the safety issue that's created because of the traffic, the existing traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1757)|
| 0:29:26| along with any new approval for multiple family housing or businesses in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1766)|
| 0:29:34| to ask them to do a study and just see if it's safe to back out into that oncoming traffic on Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1774)|
| 0:29:42| That's what I would like to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| Councilman Gallovepi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| Sir, that sounded like a pretty serious situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| I'm wondering, did anyone from your group or in that area attend the MPC meeting to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1792)|
| 0:30:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| There is a community group that exists, but no one on the Sutherland Avenue there from those homes in that two-block area was on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1802)|
| 0:30:14| So we did not attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| Mr. Donaldson, did you look at the traffic that 24 units would produce at that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| if there really is kind of an already existing dangerous situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| I'm wondering, is there something else we should be looking at from the planner's point of view in terms of egress and ingress kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1826)|
| 0:30:37| The proposed development on this site of about 20 units is well below the threshold that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1837)|
| 0:30:45| We have a threshold of 150 units before we require a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| And when compared to the number of units from the two apartment complexes that utilize driveways in this same vicinity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1849)|
| 0:30:57| that number is very, very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| Council did postpone this item for a month in order for the developer to work with the adjacent neighborhood who were in attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1860)|
| 0:31:10| when you passed this on first reading, supporting with great enthusiasm this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1870)|
| 0:31:18| I guess I would like to ask Mr. Hagerman if you have any thoughts about what a city-financed traffic study would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1878)|
| 0:31:26| I mean, normally I would expect the developer to do that if he wanted to make the condition more intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| But tell us what your perspective is on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| Jim Hagerman, city of Knoxville engineering director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| I've got to just agree with Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| It's a tiny incremental increase in the amount of traffic on that section represented by 20 odd units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1902)|
| 0:31:51| If there are issues there, we probably should be looking at them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| although it sounds like a problem that's ongoing that would be difficult to solve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1916)|
| 0:32:06| Any traffic study would almost certainly say it's not worth studying just because it's such a small additional amount of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1926)|
| 0:32:17| Are they required to put like a turn lane in their exit when they submit plans to you or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| This one has been so uncontroversial that I don't even know anything about the details on this one, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1944)|
| 0:32:33| I would have to defer to Mr. Donaldson here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| Yes, just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| A traffic study, if you did one, how long would something like that take if something like that happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1963)|
| 0:32:52| Typically it depends on how much data there is available to the firm that does the study for this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1972)|
| 0:33:01| whether they have access to that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| But typically they will quantify the existing traffic and then estimate the additional traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| So there is a period of traffic counts in that area that can take months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1990)|
| 0:33:19| So it could be several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| Well, I think at this point the neighborhood organization, Southern Heights Neighbors, did come to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2003)|
| 0:33:31| and we did postpone it, and we met with a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| And I think it would be, at this point, somewhat unfair since it's in my district to put it off again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| And the neighbors, the ones that have come and have talked with me, are pretty much in favor with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2023)|
| 0:33:51| Also, the Bearden Council of Neighborhoods, they have emailed their approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2031)|
| 0:33:57| So I'm comfortable with approving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| I'm going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| We have a motion and a second already, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| I just want to reiterate what Councilman Brown has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| I've also been involved in this, and I think the neighborhood, Dan, we've discussed it at several of their meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| I think it was two of them in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| And also there was great talk among the neighbors, and they were at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| One thing that I think possibly we could do, and not only at that particular area where this gentleman is talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| but it's obvious that we have a traffic situation on the whole street down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| And so my recommendation is that we go ahead and pass this, but also maybe engineering take a look at the avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2078)|
| 0:34:46| and see what could be done with traffic through that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| It's gotten worse instead of better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| But I recommend that we go ahead and pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| Okay, any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| I could just comment to that, Christy Branscom, Director of Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| It might be that we look at the timing of that light at that intersection as well, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| There may be a timing issue that we can adjust that will help you to get out on Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| So we will take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| Staff will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| I think also you might want to look at the speed on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| It's checked pretty carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| I have seen officers over there enforcing speed limits for sure on Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| So we'll check the speed, and then we'll also look at the timing of that signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| Mayor, one thing I said was maybe the engineering, I guess, is what really, with the roads coming out not at the lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2137)|
| 0:35:48| the trucking terminal comes out, you know, in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| The entrance and exit from Sutherland to the multiple family units on the hill there, that's not at the light either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2154)|
| 0:36:01| So I think it's more of an engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| And that turn lane at Tober only holds four cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| And, you know, I don't know how you extend it because Sutherland is probably to the max over towards those ten homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2167)|
| 0:36:16| But a turn lane to come on down there to Bell Mead would certainly help, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| at least get past that trucking terminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| We'll take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2190)|

| 0:37:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2279)|

| 0:38:11| I would ask that we change that to take effect immediately upon passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| And this is a gentleman who's gone through a great deal of process to get this rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| In order to get his loan approved, he's been struggling since the fall to get a loan approved to remodel that house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| and the bank would not do it without the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| So if we can get it through, he can get his financing package in place and get working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2314)|

| 0:41:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| I just wanted to call on Becky Wade and ask her to go through this and give a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| And it says renovate or construct or renovate at least two houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| Just kind of give us a little bit of background on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| So as you all may recall, I'm sorry, Becky Wade, Director of Community Development for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| You all may recall that every year in our annual action plan we're required to set aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| 15% of our home funds to be allocated to our local community housing development organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2519)|
| 0:42:08| or CHODOs we call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| Well, East Tennessee Housing is one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| And they have applied for funds to build two houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| My understanding is they'll be building those adjacent to two houses in Lonsdale that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| have already built, one of which is sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| And so that's what the funds are for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| They invest these funds into affordable housing for lower-income families for home ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2548)|
| 0:42:36| And Frank Sparkman is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| He's on the Board of East Tennessee Housing if you would like some more specific information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| about their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| And those are going to be close by the three houses we approved a few meetings ago for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| Knox Housing Partnership to be building three houses in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| So we'll give Lonsdale quite a pop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2580)|

| 0:43:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| Just a footnote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| Becky, when they sell those houses, does that money ever green back into the pot where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| can work on additional housing that will be improved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| That's the purpose of the program is for the proceeds from the sale to roll back into their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2594)|
| 0:43:20| process of building more houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| That's a good feature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2604)|

| 0:43:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| 11G is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a quick claim deed to Christie Reed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2612)|

| 0:43:41| Knoxville presented to the Homeacres Program for a contract sales price of $28,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| Yeah, let's talk about this one, too, because this one was bought before we were on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| So give us a history of when it was bought and then what you paid for it and then what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| we're selling it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| This was a chronic problem property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| It was certified blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| It's located in the 4th and Gill neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| It's seriously blighted property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| And council approved for us to purchase the house in January of 2010, I believe, not to exceed $45,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2650)|
| 0:44:20| And we purchased the house in 2011 for $35,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| It had to be through eminent domain and was condemned in the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| All the past due taxes were paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| And so it's been listed on the Homeacres Program since 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| We had an application earlier that didn't pan out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| They withdrew their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| So this is the second application we've had on this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| They are providing us with appraised value, which is $28,000 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2684)|
| 0:44:51| And so we are very happy to be selling this house for $28,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| As you know, the purchaser has 180 days to begin work and then a year to complete work to finish the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2697)|
| 0:45:05| And you've seen her work as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| It's like we had one last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| You've seen her work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| You're comfortable with her work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| And that she'll produce something that's comparable or better than the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| And as you know, if things don't work out, then we do have reversionary language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| and the city can take the property back if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2723)|

| 0:45:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| We ask the mayor to file a grant application with the U.S. Department of Housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| and Urban Development for a lead-based paint hazard control program grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| in an amount up to $2.5 million with a required 10 percent local match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| And if such application is approved, authorizing the mayor to execute any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| and all documents necessary to accept such an award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| You have, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| Yeah, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| Well, we're obligating the city for $250,000 should we get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| And, you know, tell us where that $250,000 is going to come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| and what the intention to do with it if we do win it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| And before you start, there is a revised resolution in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| Mr. Swanson, can you describe what the change was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| The change is simply that there were initially perceived to be some additional partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| who were going to participate in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| As it turns out, it's just going to be the Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| will be our partner in this rather than some of the other folks who were listed in the first revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2790)|
| 0:46:36| Ms. Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| What this grant would allow us to do is to enhance some programs that we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2797)|
| 0:46:43| Our owner-occupied rehab program requires that we do lead abatement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| if the house was built prior to 1978.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| And this would provide funds for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| We use our CDBG and home funds now to incorporate that work into the overall plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2815)|
| 0:47:02| So this would just add more funds into that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| It would also allow CAC, who is a partner of ours in the emergency repair program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2825)|
| 0:47:12| to add lead abatement if necessary, if there's a child under the age of seven in the home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| and if the home is of the age that it may have lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| So it's a very important project, and we really hope that we get this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| The funds that will be used for MATCH are community development block grant federal funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2846)|
| 0:47:33| that are already involved in doing these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| So it's not committing any additional dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| And it's not coming out of the general fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| Councilman Della Voque.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| I guess I have a question for Becky or someone out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| I kind of wonder about this program in the sense of there must be literally thousands of houses in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2870)|
| 0:47:58| that have paint from yesteryear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| And the reality is that you paint over the old paint with your latex paint or your new paint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| How does undisturbed lead undercoat pose a threat to anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| I mean, I guess children are walking around eating windowsills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| What is the danger if you have, you know, a multiple painted house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| and you've got modern paints that don't have these constituents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| Why remove it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Why disturb it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| If it's totally undisturbed, first of all, we will have to test to see if it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| So there are machines that we have that we can test to see if it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| If it's undisturbed and not peeling or anything else, you can paint over it and it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| If it's flaking, like most older homes, have flaking paint and there's lead there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| then it does have to be scraped and removed and disposed of properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| Okay. We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute all documents on behalf of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| to purchase a 3,047 square foot tract of real property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| a 340 square foot permanent drainage easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| and a 1,783 square foot temporary construction easement within certain real property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| located at 6501 Westland Drive from Frank C. Howard Jr. for $14,100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| as part of the Westland Drive Drainage and Bridge Improvements Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| I was just going to ask Mr. Hageman, the next three items have to deal with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| to describe the problem and what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| This is obviously on Westland Drive and it's an important area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| And one question I had is it said the shoulder is being made a little wider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2986)|
| 0:49:53| Are there sidewalks going to be put on this bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| If not, is that basically because there's no plan to put sidewalks on Westland Drive in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=2998)|
| 0:50:08| And just talk to that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3008)|
| 0:50:19| It's been a while since I looked at those details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| We've been buying these little pieces of right-of-way for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| and my recollection about the bridges is that we're widening them enough to allow sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3024)|
| 0:50:34| but we're not, as part of this project, putting in sidewalk to connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3034)|
| 0:50:41| This is just the roadway project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| Widening the shoulder will allow one to walk there a little more safely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| but it's not going that far in the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| The two bridges are quite narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| If I remember right there, at least one of them is at an odd angle to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| I'm not sure about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| And once we start improving the bridges and the shoulder, we get into the drainage issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| so we've got to deal with the drainage, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| I guess so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| I guess my concern is that if for some reason we had the resources and the will of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3081)|
| 0:51:29| to put in sidewalks on Westland, would we have to then redo these bridges again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3089)|
| 0:51:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| I am not prepared to answer your question in uncertain terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| but the best of my recollection is that we're widening them enough to allow sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| And I'll get back to you on that if you need the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| Councilman Graves, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| It's my recollection, too, and I guess we need to get into more details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| but I think that part of the discussion that came up in terms of widening this particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| and especially the bridges, was to allow for a bike lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| That was some talk at that time, and I'm not sure what they decided, you know, on that, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| There was talk of being able to bike in order to get to Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3137)|
| 0:52:23| That was one of the things that was being investigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3143)|
| 0:52:31| Well, again, this one started before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| I tried to get up to speed on it, and I'm pretty sure that there isn't room for bike lanes here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3155)|
| 0:52:44| but expanding the shoulder a little bit at least allows a little more safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3164)|
| 0:52:58| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| Yeah, Mr. Hagerman, when do you think that project could start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| and then is it going to coincide and overlap with the Lions View project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| and are you all giving consideration of those two at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| The plan is to bid it sometime this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| I think the timing with the closure is still to be negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3198)|
| 0:53:25| There was some discussion that it might actually be a good idea to do them at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3205)|
| 0:53:33| just because there wouldn't be any through traffic at that time, so there would be less need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3213)|
| 0:53:40| I mean, having them both closed at the same time would not be any worse than having one of them closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| so it may work out better to close them at the same time, but that's still under discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| and you're certainly welcome to be part of that discussion because we're still talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| I still want to be part of the discussion on the â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| if you could get a bike lane between Sherwood Drive and North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| then it really opens up a lot because you can â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| it almost gets you all the way to Morrell on Side Street, so it's a pretty short connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3249)|
| 0:54:17| but it's â€“ for those cycling through there, that would be a big connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| because you can go through Sherwood and almost get to Morrell, so that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3261)|
| 0:54:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| We've considered or heard information about Lions View having some closure due to sewer construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3271)|
| 0:54:38| Will that be going on at the same time that Westland will be having this bridge construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3278)|
| 0:54:44| Yeah, that was Councilman Wallace's question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| There is continued discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| There was the observation that it might be better to close them â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| have all of the closures done at the same time just because â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| I mean, I don't know â€“ I don't drive this part of town on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| but if you can't get through, having both of them closed at the same time might be â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3306)|
| 0:55:12| I mean, you can't get through anyway, so it doesn't hurt to have both of them closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| At least that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| But we haven't made a decision about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| We don't even know if we're going to be ready to do this necessarily at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3321)|
| 0:55:30| Discussion is ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| We haven't made any decisions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| But, I mean, it looks â€“ at this point, it looks like if we kept moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| they would be happening at the same time, which, whether good or bad â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| I mean, if we decide that we don't want to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| then we can delay this project a lot easier than we can delay the sewer line project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3346)|
| 0:55:53| Well, traveling through this area from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| it would seem to me to have all this going on simultaneously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| and alternative routes closed for construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| would warrant really seriously examining whether to close Westland and Lyons View simultaneously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| We will seriously consider â€“ if it doesn't work to close them both at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3369)|
| 0:56:16| we will delay this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| I just wanted to say, to go back again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| that one of the things that KUV is interested in in their Thursday meeting is in terms of scheduling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| They haven't determined exactly when they're going to start the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| They haven't decided whether they're going to work 7-12s or 7-24s or 10-5s or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3393)|
| 0:56:40| And that's one of the things that they're interested in finding out in terms of getting input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| not only from the residents on Lyons View, but also those folks who travel through that area quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3405)|
| 0:56:52| So that's one of the questions that hopefully that KUV will get input on Thursday in terms of schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3412)|
| 0:57:02| And then also, George, speaking of bike lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| that was another thing that we would like the city to look at during the time of the Lyons View project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3425)|
| 0:57:12| is whether or not there's room to create a bike lane on Lyons View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3432)|
| 0:57:18| Also, that was something, Jim, that has been brought up by several folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| If I may mention that we're looking at how much right-of-way is actually available now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3442)|
| 0:57:32| If we go into right-of-way process, I mean, just looking at this stack of incremental right-of-way pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| that's going on month after month on these projects kind of gives you an idea of how long it would take to do that on Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| If it's not already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| If it's not already there, it's really not practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| And we know from looking quickly that there's going to be some bottlenecks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3469)|
| 0:57:58| There are probably some places that we can do some improvements, get a little bit more space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3478)|
| 0:58:05| And it also depends on what the residents wanted a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| It may depend somewhat on what the residents decide they want to do about underground versus overhead utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3488)|
| 0:58:17| Because if we take poles out, we might have a little more room to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3497)|
| 0:58:22| But we are going to try to get some more pavement width if we can, and it would be shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3502)|
| 0:58:32| Well, some people have pushed their driveways almost into your right-of-way, it seems like, by cycling along there a number of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3512)|
| 0:58:39| I mean, some of the driveways come all the way to the little four-inch white line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3519)|
| 0:58:46| I don't know, but hopefully you can get that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| Well, the KEB project is basically going to rip out the whole street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3530)|
| 0:58:56| So we're almost starting from scratch there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| George, do you not like being airborne when you hit those driveways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| It's not desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3544)|

| 1:01:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| I had an interesting conversation with Mr. Wetzel, and I think he has something to add to this, and that is that, and I'd like him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3705)|
| 1:01:54| to explain it, but we're going to acquire this bridge approach eventually and have to maintain it, as I understand you telling me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3714)|
| 1:02:01| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| And we wanted to have the architect inspectors or the engineer inspectors working for us so that we got a good ramp and wall and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3722)|
| 1:02:12| bridge since we're going to be stuck with the maintenance of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| You can phrase it however you want, but that's the thrust of where you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| Basically, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| It will be public infrastructure at the end of the day, and we want to make sure that it gets designed and built properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| So we want to pay for the construction, engineering, and inspection that's going to go forward to ensure that it meets our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3750)|
| 1:02:36| standards as it's being constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| So we think that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| The only difference here that strikes me is that we're dipping into that $1.5 million or something that we appropriated as final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3759)|
| 1:02:47| monies, and that was the part that gives some of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| You know, we'd said up to $1.5 million for this project as needed, last money in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3771)|
| 1:02:56| This happens to come up early in the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| It's important the bridge gets started early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| It's important we do the inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| The good news is we have a pot of money set aside that we can pay for this for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| And it will be paid back later if there's money at the end of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| And I appreciate the explanation you gave me today that really we're trying to protect the city's interest in the security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3789)|
| 1:03:18| or what construction excellence of that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| And the engineers have done a good job building this contract out with our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| So I think we're in good shape there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| I appreciate your explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| I may have missed it, and it may be in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| but shouldn't that be in the document somewhere that says that this $956,000 is coming out of that $1.5 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3815)|
| 1:03:43| And I don't know, maybe it is somewhere, but it will be two years from now before that thing is finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3823)|
| 1:03:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| I just thought there ought to be some documentation somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| Maybe it is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| Well, what you'll see on your AIS, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| Fiscal Information Funding for this construction inspection services for this project will be provided by University Commons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| But we need to hire that construction out at the front end so that we'll make sure that the people doing it report to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| So that's where that will come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| So we won't be giving them $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| It will only be giving them $1.350 or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| That might be our end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| And I would use the phrase investing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| We may be investing $1.35 by the end of the project here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3863)|
| 1:04:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| As long as it's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| As long as you're clear, I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3876)|
| 1:04:37| I, too, want to appreciate the conversation we had today, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| And then this is going to be a question that's hard to answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| but are we going to have more of these coming out of the $1.5 million before the end of the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| Is there any that you're thinking might happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| I've gotten several phone calls over that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| I think council committed, and I think rightfully so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| and I'm very glad we did, to the $1.5 million in infrastructure to make this project go forward and be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| That's the thing to keep in mind here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| This is a great big project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| We need to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| As you know, $65 million projects can have some hiccups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| We certainly don't expect to be back here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| but I would tell everybody that's a big project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| There can be hiccups along the way, but I certainly think that we certainly don't anticipate it this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3917)|
| 1:05:25| Councilman Stare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| You know, I just want to say, you know, I voted against the $1.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3927)|
| 1:05:33| because I didn't think we should spend taxpayer dollars to build a Walmart in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3933)|
| 1:05:39| I don't want to be one of those politicians that votes against the taxes but then votes for the spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| so I'll be voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| Councilman Gallivanti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| I'm one of the ones that voted against what I thought was an extension of where we should be on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3953)|
| 1:06:01| that the $1.5 million should not be coming out of taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| But I am very concerned or at least appreciative of what Mr. Wetzel has told us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3966)|
| 1:06:12| that we are to some degree protecting our interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| And so while I don't feel that way about the balance of the money, I feel like to protect the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| we want to make sure that that bridge is sound and secure and that if it isn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| I don't know what provision we have in our contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| but I assume that at some point we don't have to accept or open that bridge if it's not done correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| Inspectors aren't just writing reports and then we get a bad bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| It will be a bonded project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| And if it's not built suitable to our standards and specifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| we can call that bond to finish that bridge out to the right standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| Where do we pick up just from the end of the road approach and then we get the ramp and the wall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| So that being said, I'm going to support this, even though I may not support any other aspect of drawing from these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4014)|
| 1:07:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| I do want to just clarify, based on a previous statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| that what we are spending the money on is a public road and public bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| That's what we're spending the money on right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| I've been supporting this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| If we do have some hiccups, as you describe it, and there's a request for additional funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4037)|
| 1:07:24| where would that funding potentially come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| First of all, let me say, I don't expect that we're going to be back here to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| Hopefully we won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4053)|
| 1:07:34| If we do, we'll have to have a discussion, a very serious discussion, on where that money does come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| Hopefully we don't get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| You know, this is a very experienced development team that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| They're moving forward with as much speed as they can move forward with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| And hopefully we don't get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| There's a lot of expertise in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| One in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| 11-0 is a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| Motion passes, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| 11-0 is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an agreement with Aramark Uniform Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| a division of Aramark Uniform and Career Apparel, LLC, to provide uniform rental services for various departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| within the city for an annual amount not to exceed $55,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| 11-P is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute any and all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| to apply for a grant award of $38,000 from the State of Tennessee Office of Criminal Justice Programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4113)|
| 1:08:39| with no required match for funding of a contractor to educate targeted community leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| and stakeholders on the Family Justice Center model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| and to establish a statewide Family Justice Center network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| and if application is approved, authorizing the Mayor to execute such a grant award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| I'd like to make a motion to amend this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| and if you'll follow along with me here in the first whereas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| after the numeric $38,000 where it reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| for the City of Knox for funding of a contract with an individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| I would like to strike that and add funding of an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4153)|
| 1:09:21| You mean an in-house employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| An employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| Yes, and that is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| Who's going to explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| Under the civil service rules that the city is required to go by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| this is something that would have to come through civil service and will have to be an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| It will be a temporary full-time employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| That employee will only work so long as the grant funds hold out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| and the employee will understand that coming into the position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| that this is a temporary full-time position to accomplish this single purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4192)|
| 1:09:57| But under the civil service rules, we have to make it an employee rather than a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| So that you bear some responsibility for workers' comp and all those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| I assume so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| It would be better to ask Ms. Hatfield all the questions about why that is so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| We're just told that it is so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| Jim York, would you like to respond as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| There is an IRS distinction between what is known as an independent contractor and an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| This one does not meet the test for an independent contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| and therefore that's why it's having to be reclassed as an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| They don't choose the means and methods of their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| We give them assignments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| It's the way the IRS rules requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| and we will comply with the rules for the IRS because that's a serious problem if we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4240)|
| 1:10:48| I just wanted to ask if the suggested amendment needs a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| If it does, I will second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| Okay, any other discussion about the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| So we're voting on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4260)|
| 1:11:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| And now we're on the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| 11Q is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4275)|
| 1:11:20| to trade the Knoxville Police Department's existing inventory of Glock handguns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| plus certain other firearms in the Knoxville Police Department's inventory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| along with a payment of $13,500 to Elmer Arms South LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| for 225 new .45 caliber Sig Sauer handguns and certain other specialty weapons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4293)|
| 1:11:42| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| First of all, I want to thank the chief for a fantastic email that you explained all of this in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| But I thought maybe for the general public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| you might want to just briefly explain what your email said to each one of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| But I really do appreciate the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| Yes, what I sent to Council was just an explanation of what we're going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| We have been in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| We always are looking at all of our equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| trying to determine if we have the best equipment that we can afford for our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| And what we've determined on here is this has actually been in the process for about a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4336)|
| 1:12:22| We've been testing different weapons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| And what we've come back with is the Sig Sauer .45 P220 that we want to equip all of our officers with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4344)|
| 1:12:34| And, of course, they'll go through training as soon as if this is passed and we make the trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4354)|
| 1:12:41| This is phase one of a two-phase process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| The training will start in mid-February and go through April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| And by the end of April, we'll have it all completed and the transition complete for our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| And there's, you know, as far as there's some cost savings that we're going to see over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4374)|
| 1:13:00| from what we're paying for the current weapons that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| and then what we'll see with the new weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| And plus the advantage with this is we're actually getting a weapons system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| and where we get training that is included in the trade that we're doing for our farms instructors as well as our armors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4390)|
| 1:13:19| And that as well as a warranty process as well as parts and labor that will be included with the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4399)|
| 1:13:29| I think it was also important what I read is the fact that you're trading it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| instead of putting the weapons out on the street as an auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| I think if you would address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| What happens with weapons that law enforcement takes in, not only our own weapons that we'll be trading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| but additional weapons that we confiscate throughout the year, we're restricted on what we can do with those weapons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4423)|
| 1:13:52| Used to be able to melt those down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| State law doesn't allow us to do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| And so we have kind of a couple of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| One is we can auction them off or we can trade them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| We feel it's better to trade through a reputable distributor who will then only deal with authorized firearm dealers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4444)|
| 1:14:12| and then they only go into the hands that they're supposed to go into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| those who are legally able to carry firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| And so that's one of the big pieces of this as well is we're dealing with David Hagan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| He's actually here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| He's the president of Elmer Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| Dave's back there in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| And he's who we will contract with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| Very reputable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| And I can assure you that we're comfortable with his handling of the firearms that we'll be trading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4475)|
| 1:14:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| Chief Rouse, did you only have just one company bid that or did you all bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| We bid it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| I'm not sure how many responded to the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| More than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| There was more than one that responded to the bid, but it was awarded to Elmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| And there's no other restrictions you can make on the resale of those guns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| We cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| No, they're restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| Other than federal law, I mean, there are laws that restrict the way those guns can be sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| the capacity magazines and those kind of things that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| there's, of course, a lot of conversation going on right now in terms of gun legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| Chief, I, too, appreciated all the information you gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| One question, I noticed that there's 225 new SIG Sauer handguns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| and we're trading about 600 other handguns as part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| But are we going to equip just the patrol officers as opposed to the guys who have uniforms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4537)|
| 1:15:43| and licenses but sit at a desk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| I mean, why not 430 if you've got 430 licensed officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| As I mentioned, this is phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| Phase two will come, and that will be the rest of the firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| And phase two will involve more of the trade of confiscated firearms, and you'll see that coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| But you'll have a set of officers still using Glocks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| We'll be transitioning from February to April, and so phase two will happen during that transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| Yes, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| I wanted to ask you, since we've been discussing about a lot of guns in our society now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| and I've seen where some cities have gun buybacks or whatever you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4579)|
| 1:16:25| Have we considered doing anything like that here in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| Mayor, we've done those in the past, several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| What we found is we were really paying out money for guns that really weren't the guns that we wanted to get off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4593)|
| 1:16:40| And so we kind of sway away from that program just because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| The guns we were getting were really kind of they were mostly weren't functioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| As for clunkers, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| It's about right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| And they weren't, it wasn't really accomplishing what we were hoping to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4614)|
| 1:17:00| And so, you know, the guns that are in the hands of those who shouldn't have them are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| that's a different process that we go through in investigations to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| But those weren't the ones being turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| And do you find that most of the, well, a lot of people that you wind up apprehending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| are they having much more powerful, so to speak, weapons than officers now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4638)|
| 1:17:24| We have noticed that, you know, and this has been a trend for probably about seven years now, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4644)|
| 1:17:32| is that we have noticed that there are more high-powered weapons out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4652)|
| 1:17:37| We transitioned seven years ago to allow officers that are specially trained to carry rifles in our patrol cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4657)|
| 1:17:46| And we did that because we were facing higher caliber weapons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| So we wanted to at least be able to face the firepower that was coming at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| And so we have several officers on our department that are patrol rifle officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| They're trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4679)|
| 1:18:00| They're issued rifles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| And they utilize those on patrol when needed, when necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| They carry them with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| And that meets that demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| But, yes, we have noticed that there are quite a few of those weapons in the hands of those who do not seek to use them appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4690)|
| 1:18:21| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4703)|
| 1:18:24| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| Item 12A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 22.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| to make changes necessary for the Department of Engineering to issue certain construction permits on behalf of the State of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| as a qualifying local program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| This seemed like a very good ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| And I would just like engineering just to seem pretty major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| Yes, I'd just like Mr. Hagerman to explain a little bit about the duplication that's going to be avoided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| and why this is a good thing for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| In the current system, the state, the Tennessee Department of Environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4744)|
| 1:19:09| and Conservation has construction permits as well as the city engineering construction permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4749)|
| 1:19:21| So there's a lot of duplication of effort both on the part of the regulators, us and the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4761)|
| 1:19:31| and on the part of the developers, builders who are getting the permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| They have to go get two different permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| They also, to an extent, have to follow two different sets of rules that aren't always consistent with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4777)|
| 1:19:43| So what this qualified local program gives us is the tool to administer both of those programs out of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4783)|
| 1:19:55| TDEC has empowered us to take over their part of the system on a â€“ this is pretty much on a trial basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4795)|
| 1:20:03| It's actually an honor to be one of the four communities that have been given the â€“ have been qualified as a local program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4803)|
| 1:20:18| But this allows the developer, the builder, to get only one permit to talk to only one set of inspectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4818)|
| 1:20:29| and to have one consistent set of regulations to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| You might recall when Commissioner Martineau came in several months ago where they announced â€“ pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4835)|
| 1:20:42| October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| In October to announce this program that we were one of several local governments who are authorized to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4843)|
| 1:20:52| Mayor, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| Yes, another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4853)|
| 1:20:54| Yeah, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| Jim, I think there's two aspects to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| One is that I think it's great that we're finding a way to service the people who are doing construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4861)|
| 1:21:08| to be sure that we have this sort of one-stop shopping and not kind of conflicting regulation and too much bureaucracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4868)|
| 1:21:16| I think that's really healthy for our city, and it also gives us sort of some control over the stormwater issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4876)|
| 1:21:23| which is getting obviously more and more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| The second aspect, I wonder, is this going to cost us extra as we go downstream to be the primary inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4886)|
| 1:21:34| And if so, how are we going to fund that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| I didn't know if it was by application fees or whatever that people pay when they come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| or submit their plans that require these kinds of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| If you could address that second aspect, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| There is a permit fee, and it used to be that, I mean, in the current system, both the state and the city get a permit fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4907)|
| 1:22:00| Administering the additional program does give us some more work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4920)|
| 1:22:06| We've hired an additional person to cover this program, and we are capturing the state part of that fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4926)|
| 1:22:13| So we're coming out about even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| Okay, so we're not going out and hiring 10 inspectors or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| We're going to work with our staff and get an additional person on board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| 12B is an ordinance amending Chapter 26, Article 4, Section 26-303 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| relating to requiring notification to the Knoxville Police Department prior to nonconsensual towing of vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4957)|
| 1:22:44| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| I may have just overlooked this, but maybe to the chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| If I have a private lot and want someone towed, I've got to contact the police?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4972)|
| 1:22:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| What will happen is the towing company will have to call us before they tow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| Even on a private lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| The way it works now is they contact us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| The way the ordinance is written is they contact us within an hour is what the ordinance reads now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4986)|
| 1:23:12| The issue is where it comes into play is if the vehicle is a stolen vehicle, and then they tow it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4992)|
| 1:23:19| they get it to their lot, and then they call us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| We have to come get it and tow it to the impound lot, and then that gets passed on to the person whose vehicle was stolen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| So they have to pay double record costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| And so this way it cleans it up for our victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| Will that take the same thing will happen on football weekends when all those cars are towed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| If they're parked on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| Or public property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| What happens on those, though, is it's a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| Usually those are towed by the officers, and they've already checked them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5027)|
| 1:23:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5034)|

| 1:23:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| 12F is an ordinance to assign the name Juanita Cannon Street to an unnamed alley between Wilson Avenue and Selma Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5040)|
| 1:24:07| Knoxville's Community Development Corporation applicant, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5051)|

| 1:24:16| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| I want to offer an emergency amendment in order to speed the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5057)|
| 1:24:22| And also, Alvin Nance with KCDC is here to answer any questions that anybody might have concerning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5062)|
| 1:24:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| We have an amendment to pass this on emergency, which would mean this would go into effect after this vote and not go to a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5075)|
| 1:24:42| All in favor of that amendment say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| And now back to the, does anybody have any questions for Mr. Nance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| I think we've got your votes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| It looks like everybody understands this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| It was good enough to come to the naming committee and explain it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| And now for the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5103)|

| 1:25:14| May I ask one favor, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| We haven't shared this with Juanita Cannon yet, so if you would all not share that with her yet, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5117)|
| 1:25:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5123)|

| 1:25:27| Watching TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| Please don't share this with Ms. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| Yeah, tell people at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| People at home, this is a secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| 12G is an ordinance to close a portion of an unnamed alley from Stonewell Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| to the northeast property line of parcel 81PK102 subject to conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5142)|
| 1:25:47| and authorizing the mayor to execute quick claim deeds to the adjacent property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| Gerdau Applicant, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5151)|
| 1:25:55| I'm going to move we approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| I think we have some people speaking, and I'd like to say a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5160)|
| 1:26:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| So we have a few people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| First person to sign up was Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| Would you like to come and you know the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| You have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| Yes, Mayor and members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| Gerdau, formerly Gerdau, Ameristeel, Ameristeel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5178)|
| 1:26:24| At one time, the Knoxville Iron Company has continuously operated at this location in Lonsdale since 1902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5184)|
| 1:26:34| In the 90s and continuing into this century, the plant has experienced numerous upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5194)|
| 1:26:42| and a major expansion that took place over a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5202)|
| 1:26:48| The expansion is basically complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| It has been suggested, and Gerdau has done so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| that buffering be placed between it and the neighbors in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5217)|
| 1:27:04| As part of that, we have acquired certain properties on Ely Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| We have acquired certain properties on at least Face Stonewall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5229)|
| 1:27:15| They do not carry that address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| And two properties on New York Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| With this ordinance, we are asking that you all approve on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5241)|
| 1:27:27| the closure of a portion of an unnamed alley between Stonewall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| that is bounded by properties owned by Gerdau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5252)|
| 1:27:37| This would be moving east from Stonewall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| MPC staff recommended this, and the Metropolitan Planning Commission unanimously approved this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5261)|
| 1:27:49| Now, the ordinance is not the final step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| We can't go out and put barricades down after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5272)|
| 1:27:57| There is one other street closure that will be before you next and one other one pending at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5277)|
| 1:28:05| After those ordinances go through, if they go through, and we hope they certainly do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5285)|
| 1:28:13| we will redo the alley that is a portion of which is being closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5293)|
| 1:28:22| We will redo a intersection or a turnaround on Ely Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5302)|
| 1:28:30| We are simply asking you all tonight to allow us to begin the process towards this closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5310)|
| 1:28:38| I think there may be somebody speaking against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| and I would like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5321)|
| 1:28:49| You get two minutes and rebuttal later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5332)|
| 1:28:53| And now the person to speak against it, William Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| Mr. Mays, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| And you have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| Hello, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5343)|
| 1:29:04| William Mays, 1316 Cassell Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5344)|
| 1:29:11| What we were basically wanting to talk about is my father and I, we own these properties together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| And they're rental houses, two of them that sit on Ely Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| We are not opposed to what Ameristil is doing with their expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5360)|
| 1:29:26| But what we the part that we are opposed on is in the method in which it was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5366)|
| 1:29:33| In a letter that I have typed up here, last February at an MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5373)|
| 1:29:38| it was stated that there would be no road closures until they acquired all the properties on Ely Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5378)|
| 1:29:44| As of this time, they have acquired every one of the properties except for two, and those are the two that we own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5384)|
| 1:29:51| Now, what we are faced with, and here's the issue now, you know, we've kind of faced this with the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5391)|
| 1:29:57| And we know it's we can't, you all can't make them buy our properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| But here's what has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| With these road closures, it's given them what they want in being able to close these roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5404)|
| 1:30:09| They've bought all those houses and either have demolished them all or in the process demolished them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5409)|
| 1:30:16| Now, we never was, in the first place, we didn't want to sell these properties because we buy properties as investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| and we rent them out as our income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| But once we found out that they were basically going to buy the whole street, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5424)|
| 1:30:29| we weren't necessarily opposed to that because everybody down the street was getting pretty good offers for their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5429)|
| 1:30:35| well above what they had paid for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| So we weren't going to have any problem because everybody on the street said we're going to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| So when we got down to our property, what you're faced with is if you're standing on the front porch of either one of our two houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5443)|
| 1:30:49| you have a marriage still that runs pretty much as far as you can see in both directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| To the left, there's nothing from the next street over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| There's nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| It's all vacant industrial lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| To the right was a neighborhood of houses, but they've all been bought and torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5462)|
| 1:31:08| There's nothing behind except one house, a church, which there's never anyone out except for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5468)|
| 1:31:13| a couple of church services a week, and then a glass business that, of course, is not open in the evening hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5473)|
| 1:31:21| What we are now concerned with with our two properties is the value that's dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5481)|
| 1:31:27| And not only the value dropped, but concerns that have come up both with us and with our tenants too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5487)|
| 1:31:33| There's no community left with our two houses now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| I mean, basically, we used to have neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| Now we have fields and we're going to have fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| And, you know, we're from the Lonsdale area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| and I don't mean to incur that anything that it's a horrible neighborhood or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5504)|
| 1:31:50| but anyone that's aware of that neighborhood knows that the crime statistics have went up dramatically in the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5510)|
| 1:31:58| And crime usually takes place where there's the least amount of odds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5518)|
| 1:32:03| What I'm concerned with with my two houses now is that these areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| and this cul-de-sac that they're going to be putting in is going to become a high-targeted area for drug sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5527)|
| 1:32:13| drug use, maybe even prostitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| I know when you walk around areas over there, we have other houses in Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| that have been in areas where there's no neighbors, and in the moment those houses go vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5540)|
| 1:32:26| you end up with all your copper wiring stolen, windows busted, sheetrock destroyed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| guttering ripped off the houses so they could take and sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| And you basically end up with nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| Now, obviously, I can't, you can't make them buy my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| But with the road closures, it gives them no reason to buy the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5563)|
| 1:32:50| And if we would have known about the way the MPC worked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| we were told that it was being taken off the list a few meetings ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| only to come to find out that we didn't know that it was still owned there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| because there was a plan to have it postponed, but it ended up going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5583)|
| 1:33:09| And so we wasn't able to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| That's why it was unanimously voted against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| There's still one closure coming up for the next month's MPC meeting, which is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5593)|
| 1:33:18| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5598)|
| 1:33:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| One more coming up, which is Ely Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| What I want done is the postponement of you all approving these road closures for the simple fact that we want the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5603)|
| 1:33:32| to hear out the next hearing and see what they do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| And we believe that if these roads are not closed like Ameristill wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5617)|
| 1:33:45| that they'll do the same for us that they did for everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| That's all we're asking is for fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| We're not asking for any more than anybody else up the street received for theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| But what we don't want is our two properties basically being worth nothing now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| because there's no community left except for a steel yard in every direction, it seems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5639)|
| 1:34:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| Mr. Seymour, you have up to two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| One thing I would like to point out, Girdow is a heavy industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| The property is zoned I-4 where they operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| They have a fence around the perimeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| These new properties that they have acquired will be incorporated into the perimeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5662)|
| 1:34:28| There will be fencing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| We have security cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| We have security patrols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| We don't want anybody in, on, or climbing the fence in our property that is not an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5675)|
| 1:34:43| who has been properly trained and is qualified to work at Girdow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5683)|
| 1:34:49| So I think that takes care of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| What Mr. Mays is basically asking you to do is weigh in on negotiations on the purchase of his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5691)|
| 1:34:58| I don't want to go into this unless you all want me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| We think we've made a fair offer for his property, and we have comparables that would support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5702)|
| 1:35:10| And what he is asking you to do is postpone and force us to buy his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5710)|
| 1:35:17| We are willing to pay a fair price and have made such an offer to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5717)|
| 1:35:23| and that offer does not have a termination point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| But that's all he's asking for with the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| We would ask that you go ahead and approve this on first reading tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5733)|
| 1:35:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| Yeah, I've spoken to community development about this, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| they don't have a problem per se with this closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5746)|
| 1:35:51| There's, you know, we're not getting into the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| It's not an issue at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| I think there's been offers made that would grant the owner profit maybe two to three times over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5755)|
| 1:36:03| The crime speculation is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| I mean, we don't know exactly what would happen there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| but I believe in our police department and the security at Grinnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| So it's a, you know, I think, you know, my interest going forward is to work with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5772)|
| 1:36:18| Steve Ritter in the Lonsdale United for Change is important to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5778)|
| 1:36:23| and there's a lot of redevelopment in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| And we need to, you know, as a city, as a community, and a community development department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5786)|
| 1:36:33| and a mayor still, I mean, you know, let's sit down and look going forward, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5793)|
| 1:36:38| just put it on the table looking at the maps, you know, where is the footprint going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| where are we going to draw the line and protect the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| and allow the business to maintain and expand a small footprint that is good for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5805)|
| 1:36:51| So I do support this, and I've made that motion for this closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| but, you know, we will need to address this going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| We have three, this item and the next two, we have three other ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| I assume there's some minor changes made in these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| Maybe our law director can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5832)|
| 1:37:20| The changes were simply when you're retaining your easement is to include specifically within the retained easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5840)|
| 1:37:28| the opportunity to put drainage facilities in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| The wording might have been broad enough to do it anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| but rather than take that chance we have changed the wording on the easement to retain drainage easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5856)|
| 1:37:42| and that's really the only change that's been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| Thank you, Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| Okay, any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| 12H is an ordinance to close a portion of Stonewall Street from New York Avenue to Ely Avenue subject to conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5876)|
| 1:38:02| and authorizing the mayor to execute quick claim deeds to the adjacent property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| Gerdau Applicant, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| I move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5890)|
| 1:38:11| Motion, or motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| 12I is an ordinance to close a portion of the right-of-way adjacent to North Mall Road from Millartown Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5898)|
| 1:38:23| to the west property line of parcel 59LB3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5903)|
| 1:38:26| and authorizing the mayor to execute quick claim deeds to the adjacent property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| Sam's Real Estate Business Trust Applicant, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| Mayor, I want to move to approve this, but I'm going to have an amendment to follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5919)|
| 1:38:40| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| Now, Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| Yes, this situation arose, I guess, somewhere in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5925)|
| 1:38:51| I guess the Sam's Club has purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| Lower your mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| The Sam's Club purchased a piece of grassy area that's technically part of the state right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5935)|
| 1:39:01| and they've gotten the deed, acquired the property, closed on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| and learned indirectly that in order for our system of mapping to be accurate in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5945)|
| 1:39:14| the ward map, which is the official map, has to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| They had to go back through MPC to initiate that process, and it's come here to city council to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5957)|
| 1:39:26| The amended motion will be to approve it as an emergency, sort of effective upon passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5966)|

| 1:39:49| and there's not really any controversy over the use of that land, which is owned now by Sam's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130122?start=5989)|
