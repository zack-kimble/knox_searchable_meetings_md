| 0:00:00| So everybody came, you know, holding hands, singing kumbaya on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=0)|
| 0:00:04| And I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=4)|
| 0:00:05| I mean, just like, you know, in probably two weeks' time on Kingston Pike and Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=5)|
| 0:00:10| we're going to have a very similar issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=10)|
| 0:00:12| And we've got, you know, there's a little bit of been a demarcation here with the transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=12)|
| 0:00:20| between a residential zoning and zonings that are not residential, whether they're office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=20)|
| 0:00:25| or commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=25)|
| 0:00:28| My concern is that we're going to start, you know, chipping away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=28)|
| 0:00:31| I mean, you know, the same arguments can easily be made on Kingston Pike coming up here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=31)|
| 0:00:37| two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=37)|
| 0:00:38| So, you know, I have concerns that, you know, when you come in and you get a specific use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=38)|
| 0:00:43| on review, its intention is to minimize what can be in there, to, you know, work a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=43)|
| 0:00:53| with what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=53)|
| 0:00:54| But when you do the total wholesale change, it throws open a lot more possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=54)|
| 0:01:00| So I have concerns about that, and accordingly, I'll move to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=60)|
| 0:01:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| There's a motion and a second to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=66)|
| 0:01:09| Is there further comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=69)|
| 0:01:11| May I also say something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=71)|
| 0:01:13| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=73)|
| 0:01:14| Next door, after we had started building the property, moved in, the house next door to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=74)|
| 0:01:19| us, Gary Kuntz, the real estate agent, purchased it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=79)|
| 0:01:23| He changed it to an O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=83)|
| 0:01:25| He has an O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| Across the street is an O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| I'm not sure I understand why I'm not able to go with an O1 when, like I said, all I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=87)|
| 0:01:33| looking for is I'm not wanting to do anything except be able to have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=93)|
| 0:01:38| Because like I said, if something happens to that physician next door and I can't find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=98)|
| 0:01:42| another physician, I am obviously going to be in trouble financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=102)|
| 0:01:48| And if it's across the street, they have, you know, the real estate and realty executives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| I mean, it's across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| It's this large three buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| I'm not, you know, asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| I don't think I'm asking for too much just to be able to have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| I promise you, we're not looking to go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=122)|
| 0:02:04| We want to stay there, but we just need that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| Ms. Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Well, I guess I have a question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| I'm looking at the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| Do you have it before you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| Ms. Byrd is indicating that across the street, it's O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=138)|
| 0:02:24| Help me see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| I'm not seeing it on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| Not like directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| It's like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| It's about 500 feet to the southwest from her property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| I see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| And I see one then to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| Northeast?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| What's north?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| There's two lots to the north and east that are zoned O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=160)|
| 0:02:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| Well, I wanted to be sure I had before me what everyone else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| I guess, Ms. Byrd, it's a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| And I think when you were making your statement, you said three years ago, you talked to an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=176)|
| 0:03:01| architect and he said, don't open up a can of worms, keep it as R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| The can of worms, I mean, the challenge you got is you avoided a can of worms then it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| got your building built, and the can of worms is sort of worse now because I think this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| would have been a different discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| I don't know what Ms. Davis would say, but were you coming in three years ago and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| I want an office zone, that would have been the proper place to have the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| Now you sort of, you made the choice to avoid a can of worms once, and it's just worse now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| So that's part of what happened, and your architect, I think, didn't give you good advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| Otherwise, you can't remember her name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| Councilman Hoeklis, do you have something to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| Well, I just, I pulled it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| When you see it in color, it's more graphic, but there are no O1s immediately adjacent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| as Councilman Pelo pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| And Mr. Donaldson also, but they're sprinkled in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| That decision was made at some point to put those in there, but they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| The predominant zoning all around there is R2 surrounded by R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=243)|
| 0:04:12| Further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| The motion on the floor is to deny, made by Mr. Frost, seconded by Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| General situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Any further comments anybody would like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| All those in favor of denying, signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| Those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| Well, I abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| I just simply, I just have a serious problem with this whole issue, because it was before us in 03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=271)|
| 0:04:42| I remember this specifically, and I just have, I'm sorry, I cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| Vote is eight in favor of denial, zero against, and one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Terrible situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| Item 12S is the rezoning of this same property, and that is mooted because you cannot do the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=297)|
| 0:05:03| unless you change the one-year plan, and so that's automatically denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=303)|
| 0:05:09| Moving on to the next item, which is 12T, an ordinance to rezone property from A1 General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=309)|
| 0:05:16| Agricultural District to R1 Low Density Residential District, property located on the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| of Seaver Drive, southeast of Francis Road, James R. Christopher applicant, 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=322)|
| 0:05:29| There are two folks signed up to speak in opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| Would you like to hear from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| Sherry Walsh and Robert Rangel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| I'm sorry, I might have mispronounced that, but if you both could come forward, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=338)|
| 0:05:47| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| I'm Sherry Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| I live at 7042 Seaver Drive, next door to the property that's planning to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=351)|
| 0:06:01| Our neighborhood has met on several occasions, and we've talked to a representative of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=361)|
| 0:06:09| Our neighborhood has reached the consensus that we're not actually opposed to the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=369)|
| 0:06:16| What we are opposed to is the development of more than five homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=376)|
| 0:06:23| Collectively, some of the concerns that we have, and we have sent some emails to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=383)|
| 0:06:30| council members so that you'll have kind of a feel for where we stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| Seaver Drive traffic and road safety is a major concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| The existing road is 14 to 15 feet wide in most places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| The telephone poles are very close to the pavement on one side, and there are very large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| trees close to the pavement on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| There's a blind hill on this road, and it's paved, and the entire road is paved in kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| of a wavy fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| When the paving was done, they avoided the large trees, and so, you know, when you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| at a map, it looks like a straight road, but you just kind of shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| So in order for cars to drive down our road, we have to pull over into the yards to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| And, you know, we've been okay with that because we haven't had that much traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| We also have a concern with the development compatibility with the existing residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=440)|
| 0:07:27| areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| As seen on the map that was sent out with our emails, the surrounding residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| mostly spaced out single-family residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| There are six houses along one side of this property, Shiloh Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| There is one house on the other side, and that one's mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| There are one and a half houses across the street and one house on the backside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=464)|
| 0:07:51| The developer has said he'd like to put five to 11 houses on this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| That's what we've been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| The neighborhood consensus regarding these two concerns is that we've been told that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| the developer would not be made to widen all of Seaver, which we had discussed at the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| meeting, that probably only a portion of the road would be made to be developed or widened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=489)|
| 0:08:18| and that the road improvements would probably not take care of the safety concerns that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| If there were an additional three feet, it would be very difficult to pave on this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| because of the large trees on one side and the power poles so close to the pavement on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| By doing this, what we'd like to do is we are willing, as a collective neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| to agree to leaving the road as it is, as long as the developer is limited to a maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| of five houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| By doing this, the traffic impact would be minimal as possible, be as minimal as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| considering the property rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| Other issues that we have, stormwater volume and drainage from the developed property onto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| Now, we know that there will be drainage studies made and these issues will be addressed through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| the city engineering department, but we just want to go on record as having concerns about how the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| drainage will affect all of our properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| The topography of this property, when you look at the map, it's just a flat piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| But when you come out and look at the property, we've got a hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| And there's, in the front of my house, I have a 200-foot setback because of drainage, and it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=573)|
| 0:09:40| kind of slopes towards me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| The people on Shiloh have septic tanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| They're on a drain fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| I mean, sewer comes up one side of Seaver and up the other side of Seaver, and so the properties there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| on Shiloh are on septic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| They are concerned about the drainage, you know, into their drain fills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| So, you know, we are concerned about the number of residences that would be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=600)|
| 0:10:09| One more minute, Ms. Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| I'm almost through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| One other thing is the continued maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| We've been advised that they are planning a private road development within their development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=617)|
| 0:10:24| just, I think, a joint permanent easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| And the drainage within the new development, after the project's completed and the property has several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| new owners, are the concerns that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| When you have, and Shiloh can, Robert can address this a little bit better, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| But private roads do not have to meet the same standards as public roads and will not be maintained by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=640)|
| 0:10:46| The storm drain standards are also different within private roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| Once the developers have sold the property, what happens if the homeowners association does not have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| ability to keep up the maintenance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| Our neighborhood consensus concerning these two concerns is we'd like for the developer to take the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| that he would have had to spend on widening Seaver Drive, use it to put a public road and storm drains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| within his development, to put a privacy fence around the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| and to make the detention areas more attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| And we would like for him to put this in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| Thank you very much for your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| Robert Rangel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| I'm sure I'm botching it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| Yes, my name is Robert Rangel, and I live at 1609 Shiloh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| And on behalf of all the Shiloh homeowners there, we are in accordance with Sherry Walsh here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=690)|
| 0:11:37| and are concerned about drainage and, you know, lots of privacy, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| because we're backed up to some beautiful woods there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| So I was just here to second Ms. Walsh's comments here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| I think the applicant is here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| Ted Buell, 1648 Dicklonus Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| I live just around the corner from this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| The applicant has asked me to represent him this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| We have met with the Neighborhood Association and a couple of different conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=733)|
| 0:12:22| And we are sympathetic to their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| We have already had conversations and meetings with a professional engineer about the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=745)|
| 0:12:32| about roads, drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| We would simply ask that the property be rezoned RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| We're happy to live with all the regulations, all the zoning ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| and all the design standards that would be required for RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| And we would be happy to have more dialogue with the Neighborhood Association if that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| We're not asking for any special considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| We're not asking for a joint permanent property easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| We're just asking to work with the ordinance as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| and to have our property rezoned in accordance with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| The adjacent property is RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| The property across the street is RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| I'm sorry, is R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| We're asking for R1 only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| The property to the rear is RP1 at present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| We're only asking for R1 in accordance with R1 and with existing regulations that go with R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=807)|
| 0:13:35| I think you'll find that this is in character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| It's a single-family neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| And the property owner wishes to develop this as single-family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| in accordance with the regulations that are on the books now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Mr. Buol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| Would you respond to two issues that I'm curious about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| One, Ms. Walsh has commented that the neighborhoods, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| I believe both neighborhoods, Mr. Engle as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| have determined that five dwellings per that acreage would be satisfactory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=844)|
| 0:14:15| What is your response to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| The owner and the developer would like to have it R1 and to work with the NPC to put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=857)|
| 0:14:25| No, I'm asking you to respond to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| The five lots would probably not work economically for the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| At one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| He was asked to put in complete 26-foot wide roads with curbs and sewer and that just won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=874)|
| 0:14:42| It was my understanding that at one point you had agreed to five lots and improve the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=882)|
| 0:14:52| Now, has that since been something you've determined you can't do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| There was never any agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| I believe the gentleman in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Is he the developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| Please, would you respond to that if you're in a position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| As far as the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| We need your name, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| My name is James R. Christopher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| I'm the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| As far as the five lots were concerned, in the NPC meeting we had asked for RP1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| which we were not granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| So we agreed to accept R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| In the meeting it was stated that we would, with a certain amount of lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| we would be financially able to widen the road to the point that it would be a safe road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=925)|
| 0:15:31| But upon looking at that, with all the utilities that would have to be removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| and all the big trees that would have to be removed, my point was this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| I went to the NPC and said that if we were granted less than five lots or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| we could not afford to widen the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| Sir, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| I'm not talking about Seaver Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| I'm talking about I think your offer was to widen it right at the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| or the access to this property, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| With five units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| It was stated to me if we agreed to five units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| and this came from the staff in a phone conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| that they would grant us by signing off on it that we could have a 40-foot permanent easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| with a 20-foot paved road into this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| And that came from the staff of the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| And it was not ever our intentions to widen the road if that's what they were going to give us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| for the simple fact that it would not financially be acceptable to put a 26-foot road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| into this property with five lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| It just wouldn't be feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| I understand about widening the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| I wanted to be sure we clarified that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| Now, respond to five lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| What is your question about the five lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| Five dwellings on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| Can you develop it, will you develop it with five lots on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1013)|
| 0:17:00| That is what both neighborhoods have agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| That's what's really before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| That's what the owner of the property will have to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| I cannot make that decision for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| I represent him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| I'm a representative of his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Well, tonight's decision time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| Well, I mean, you know, that was the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| So it was important for you to come knowing what he was in a position to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| Well, it was never stated to me that we needed to make a decision on the five or 11 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| Well, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| We need to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| I know you make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| But I can't make the decision for the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| But I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| If you grant the R1, more than likely he'll do the five lots because it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| it's been one of those issues that we've tried to work with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| but financially it makes it impossible to take this track of land and put five homes on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| and pay $250,000 for a 700-foot road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| I think the community realizes that's a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| That's part of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| I'd like to ask Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| Is it even possible for us to approve this and limit it to five lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| I would be very uncomfortable if you approved R1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| and then put that kind of a condition on it because the R1 base zoning establishes density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| through minimum lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| If it were done under an RP1, then that sort of condition would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| However, then you bring into play the opportunity for condominiums and attached houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| and a wider array of uses than you have in the R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| So devil with a couple of horns there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Mr. Hall, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| MPCD consider RP1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| The initial request was for RP1 at up to 5.99 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1140)|
| 0:19:13| Let me try to stick with council folks asking direct questions if I could at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| Well, I guess I've got a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| Because MPC has considered RP1, can we grant RP1 and limit it to five lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1163)|
| 0:19:30| I believe that you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| But do we want to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| Let me make sure Mr. Hall is finished first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| Well, I'll hold on to that for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| We can come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| Mr. Buell, what I heard Mr. Christopher say is we're sort of, you know, we get the R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| We're probably going to do five units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| It sounds like sitting up here, it sounds like you all are very close to an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| The neighborhood wants five units and a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| You might be willing to talk about five units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| I don't know if we're not at a point where this is something that you all can talk a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| and work something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| And I'm, you know, maybe not make that motion yet because it's not my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| but suggest that that could be an option here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| I'd like to ask Ms. Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| How does all this sound to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| The neighborhood, I mean, I'm not speaking just for myself, but for the rest of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| MPC, I have their report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| They did not go with the RP1 because, number one, of the compatibility with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1233)|
| 0:20:43| And also, with the detached houses, I mean, with the attached houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| basically a need and justification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1249)|
| 0:20:56| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| R1 zoning is an extension of zoning from the north and east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| and is more compatible with surrounding development than the requested RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| The proposed condominium development at the requested density would be out of character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| with surrounding development and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| The pavement width of Seaver Drive is marginal for the proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| which would allow consideration of up to 20 units on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| If the request is approved, road improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| including widening would likely be required to Seaver before proceeding with the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1279)|
| 0:21:26| The only other RP1 zoning in the area is to the southwest of this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| and is accessed from Francis Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| which is a minor arterial street with sufficient pavement width to support the density allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| The site is approximately 135 feet in width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| RP zoning requires a 25-foot peripheral building setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| leaving about 85 feet of width to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| This situation would likely lead to an access road being constructed down one side of the track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| along the rear or side property lines of neighboring properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| and not allow for the installation of the proper landscape screening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| that staff would recommend to buffer between the substantial density difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| This application may be more attractive if additional properties were added to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| but if Seaver Drive is to be used for access, road improvements will be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| The effects, basically, it says the proposed RP1 zoning is not compatible with adjacent residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:24| and may have a negative impact on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| The recommended R1 zoning is more suitable for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| It says here the recommended R1 zoning would allow the property to be subdivided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| into lots of no less than 7,500 square feet in area for single detached dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| The neighborhood understands that there's going to be development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| I mean, we're trying to come to where's our happy medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1365)|
| 0:22:52| If you take a look at the map, and I have got maps right here that show the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1372)|
| 0:23:01| of exactly where the houses sit on these lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1381)|
| 0:23:11| You know, when we met with Mr. Buell, he was the urban planner that the developer had chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1391)|
| 0:23:18| He does live on Dick Francis Road, which is just around the corner from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| He came down and we met, and he showed us two proposals, one with 11 houses and one with five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1401)|
| 0:23:30| If the developer, and I have been online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| I've tried to read the regulations regarding subdivisions, roads, that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1414)|
| 0:23:42| to educate myself as far as what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| You know, I do feel, I mean, the neighborhood feels like the developer does have the right to develop his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1426)|
| 0:23:55| He does have a right to make money on, you know, purchasing this property and developing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| However, you know, and we want to work with him as long as it doesn't have a negative impact on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1441)|
| 0:24:08| But if you look at Shiloh, there are six houses down Shiloh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| Then there's this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| And if you put 11 houses on, and it is only wide enough to put their road on one side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1455)|
| 0:24:23| So, you know, we looked at, you know, the proposed 11 sites versus the proposed five sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1463)|
| 0:24:30| And it's not going to be one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| It's either going to be five or 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| Because if you have five lots or less, then there's not a stringent road requirement as far as joint permanent easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1475)|
| 0:24:45| or drainage and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| If you have more than five, it doesn't matter if you have six or 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| So, you know, they're not going to be limited to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| They'll have to go with the 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| I mean, and I understand the economic reasons for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| The neighborhood understands it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| But we still have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| And, you know, we do want the integrity and the compatibility of our neighborhood to stay the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| And like I said, you know, when you start looking also at the site that he has, the property goes like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1510)|
| 0:25:19| There's going to be a requirement for a detention pond in the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| and more than likely a detention area in the very back of the property because of the way it slopes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1523)|
| 0:25:30| You know, we would just, you know, beg to, and we're very opposed to the RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:37| We just feel like that's not at all part of what our neighborhood is about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| I was just going to say, Councilman Hall, it looks like they're in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| It's just how do you arrive at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| And it's my understanding in the R1 zoning, we can't limit it to five dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1553)|
| 0:26:01| They can limit it themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| Yeah, but we don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| Let me go back to the light here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| Mr. Donaldson, if we did this RP1 and the developer clustered everything at one portion of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| could they come back later for a one-lot subdivision and have the rest available for RP1 for further development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1575)|
| 0:26:25| That's probably a likely scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| I think, I mean, Mr. Hall, I understand, yes, we cannot sit back here and mandate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| I think this is something where they're going to make an agreement with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| It feels like that's eminently doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| And I guess my sense is they ask for a postponement for two weeks or four weeks and let them figure this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1607)|
| 0:26:55| because I think they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| I don't think we're that far apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| Is that your sense or is that your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| I'll make it a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| That was going to be my motion to second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| There's a motion by Mr. Becker, a second by Ms. Pelow to postpone for two weeks is what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| Ms. Roddy, do you want to comment on that or is that for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| I'm not going to support postponement, because although it seems that they're very close in principle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| I'm getting stuck on the technicalities of our zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| and I'm having trouble visioning a solution to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| because I don't think we have the right to limit the number of houses in an R1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| And I've already seen why MPC turned down RP1 because of the concern of the detached housing Councilman Frost just spoke to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1656)|
| 0:27:45| clustering, re-subdividing, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| I drove extensively around this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| I drove up and down Seaver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| I drove back down Shiloh all the way in and looked back over the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| came back out Seaver, down Francis, down Sukony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| And it's almost agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| I mean, the lots or the houses are set way back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| I mean, it is agricultural, but it has that feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| The houses are set way back, and I just don't see a subdivision she whored in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| So I will not be supporting the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| Mr. Donaldson, I just want to make sure I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1702)|
| 0:28:28| RP1 cannot be used to ñ if RP1 were approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| and had to go back through use under review for an actual concept plan approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| the concept plan obviously is constrained by the 25-foot peripheral building setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1718)|
| 0:28:45| Can that be varied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| Who varies it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| BZA, that's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| Beyond that, can a plan be restricted to essentially detached dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1736)|
| 0:29:08| that are laid out like a subdivision, and can they be parceled separately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| Or does it have to be ñ obviously it can be parceled out at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| as Councilman Frost pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| Essentially, is there any way to get there to mandate the five units maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| in some sort of acceptable layout on that site using that zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| Because obviously we don't have any other zoning tools right now to allow us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| Is there any way you can stretch the RP1 zone to make that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:46| It's not a matter of stretching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| I think it's a matter of constricting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| Well, maybe a better choice of words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| You can control the density, and you can condition it by eliminating some of the uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| that are allowed, and we break down the uses amongst houses, duplexes, hatched houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1800)|
| 0:30:08| multi-dwelling structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| As long as you're going down the road of putting conditions on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| you could condition some of those uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| So you could control the density and limit the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1817)|
| 0:30:24| I'm not sure who was next, Mr. Beckerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| I'll go, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| I just want to know what the third district representative thought about the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| I mean, I don't have a problem with the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| I do sort of share Councilman Roddy's concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| I don't know what there is to work out that can get from what we've talked about here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| that will get them locked in on five units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| Mr. Beckerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Maybe I'm naive, or maybe you all are cynical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| but I believe if the applicant comes in and says, this is what I'm going to do, that they're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| And maybe I should be more cynical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| but I actually believe that when people say they're going to do something, they're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| So I think the solution is they work something out, and they worked in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| Maybe that's naive, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| I only refer you back to the items previously on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| Ms. Peele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| Well, I'm having a hard time with if somebody says something that will work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| but I'm not having a hard time with the written contract between the two groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| Do that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| And, I mean, that appears to be the only solution here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| If we're not in a position to have a conditional zoning, then it appears that the two groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1892)|
| 0:31:41| I believe it's three neighborhoods, is it just two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| and the developer need to come to a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| Otherwise, this is going to be a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| There's no other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| We have no other route to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| So I think two weeks would give you time to do that, and that's the only reason I support the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| Mr. Holkus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| Ms. Peele just proposed a written contract between the parties represented here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| Is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| I guess maybe a conservation easement or the equivalent of a conservation easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| you can do a third-party easement that restricts property, but is there any other mechanism for doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| If that written contract takes the form of certain deed restrictions, I think that's possibly doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| This city government will not enforce those deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Everybody understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| But as between the parties and anybody that deed restrictions provides who can enforce those deed restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1961)|
| 0:32:48| then you could possibly accomplish what you want to accomplish in that fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1968)|
| 0:32:56| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| Excuse me one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| Council, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| At this point in time, we're really at council folks speaking or asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| I'd like to hear what Ms. Walsh has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| That will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| Based on kind of the conversation, and it's going to take me a little while, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| to process exactly what is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| But I think I speak for the neighborhood when I say that the neighborhood is opposed to RP1 completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=1993)|
| 0:33:21| because of some of the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| After reading the zoning ordinance itself, I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| when you're talking about, you know, not being able to limit R1, I think that it's even sometimes the RP1 with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2009)|
| 0:33:36| attached houses, it does not allow, I mean, you know, it does allow for attached unless you can change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| I think that, you know, based on what the MPC said about, you know, having R1 with, you know, having R1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2023)|
| 0:33:53| and if they have 11 houses, then they're going to have to widen the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| I mean, that's, I mean, I don't, I mean, at least that's what my opinion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| And, you know, we're going to really stick to that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| What I think we'd like is either, and with what I'm understanding about the deed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| about them doing an agreement, if we can work out something with five houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2054)|
| 0:34:21| then I think our, you know, we may be able to work with that as long as we can be assured that it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| they could be held accountable to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| Otherwise, we'd like to ask for a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| Mayor, I think we've got a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| That's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| And I think, based on what I've heard, that we ought to postpone it for two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| ask them to go back and write up a contract that has the deed restrictions in there necessary and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2084)|
| 0:34:51| Seeing no further lights, I'm going to assume that no one else wants to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| The motion on the floor is to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| Those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| I heard eight ayes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| It will be postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| And I think you had a good sense of what council was asking you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| I know a couple of folks had signed up for U and V that are still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| But just as a reminder, those were postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2120)|
| 0:35:27| Next item is Ordinance 12-W, an ordinance approving the request of Phil Savage for a one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2127)|
| 0:35:35| from mixed-uses office medium-density residential to general commercial for the front parcel only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2135)|
| 0:35:42| property located on the northeast side of Western Avenue, southeast of McKamey Road, Third District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| Questions or comments on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| Actually, the way I read this, we're rezoning this so somebody can borrow more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| And I worry about that as a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| It's an interesting financing scheme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| I don't know if it's a good reason to rezone property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| So I think I'm going to be voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Sir, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| I think you're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| If you want to go ahead and give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| My name is Phil Savage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| Our address is 156 Country Walk Drive in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| Our property is home to Premier Athletics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| It's formerly Knoxville Gymnastics Training Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| It's a gymnastics center that has served and actually enriched the families of Knoxville for more than 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2187)|
| 0:36:35| Lisa and I want to reinvest in the property and improve the quality of service for these future families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| By zoning this property commercial, the value will increase, which will allow us to utilize some of the equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| to make improvements on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| The building is about 17 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| Our neighbors support our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| We have a good relationship with our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| We have a letter signed by every neighbor that backs up to our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2216)|
| 0:37:04| And the MPC has already approved the property in front, which is a cheerleading facility in front of ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2224)|
| 0:37:12| and they've approved for a change to zoning to general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| We would like for our property to be zoned general commercial as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| Any questions for Mr. Savage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| Those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| I heard eight ayes and one no from Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| Motion passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| 12X is just on that last item, just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| The property that was just rezoned was the rear building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| The front building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| I thought you said the cheerleading was out front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| It's pretty much the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| Cheerleading is up front, and our gymnastics center kind of feeds, you know, that cheerleading center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| This only shows the front part as subject to rezoning on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| Just the front part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| I think the entire property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| It just didn't indicate that on the map that's in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| I think in the front section already zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| It's approved by MPC to be zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| I think Mr. Donaldson has a comment to make there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| The initial application came in requesting that both parcels be included in the one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2308)|
| 0:38:37| and the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| The recommendation that came out of the MPC was that only the parcel fronting on the road be amended in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2319)|
| 0:38:49| and on the zoning, so only the front parcel is shown as the MPC recommendation for plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2329)|
| 0:39:06| But this council just rezoned the entire parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| He was talking about the rear building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| That's why I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| When I applied, I applied for both properties at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| But Mr. Donaldson is saying only the front building has been rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| They made a recommendation to rezone only the front parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| But the action that council just took upheld that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| That was the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| The one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| We didn't do the zoning yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| What's before us next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| Go ahead, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2386)|

| 0:40:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Ken Pruitt said to just to, you know, come before you and because initially we had planned, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| both properties to be zoned, rezoned to C3, and that's what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| I think everybody clear where we are now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Thank you, Mr. Savage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2427)|

| 0:40:33| No and no again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| So eight ayes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2434)|

| 0:41:26| 12AA is an ordinance approving the request of Dart Livingston for a one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| from medium-density residential to office for property located on the northwest side of Topside Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2492)|
| 0:41:39| east side of Alcoa Highway, 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| This is related to that other one that was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| Mr. Livingston is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| He can explain that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| I'm not going to make a motion until he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| The other one was actually a road closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| Dart Livingston, 208 Blue Sky Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| I filed the application and the fee before I found out about the closure implications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2523)|
| 0:42:10| and I didn't withdraw the request because I was going to ask your opinion on maybe possibly putting the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2530)|
| 0:42:17| back up the pipeline until TDOT makes a final decision on their project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| Did they say when their final decision is supposed to be made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| They're supposed to vote on it, and if it does get approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| then it will be three years before anything happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| So I basically have to sit on my hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| Well, we can't postpone this for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| 120 days is the maximum, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| I guess, does this council have any advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| or particularly I guess you as the 1st District rep for what he should do in this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| Well, I'd say you're going to have to reapply once you figure out what TDOT is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| But where that puts you on this application is you've already paid your fee and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| and I guess you're just going to have to withdraw it or deny it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| and then you'll lose your fee and you'll have to start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| Is there any way, Mr. Donaldson, that we could sort of do that without prejudice in case he does want to bring it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| back in a year's time based on the MPC's rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| Something should be accelerated with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| This is a one-year plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| and the one-year sterilization applies only to zoning requests, so I think we're probably okay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2602)|
| 0:43:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| You could postpone for up to 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| I mean, I don't know if TDOT will, you know, make up their mind between now and then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| but it would keep it alive and wouldn't be denying or approving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| But knowing TDOT, it will come back to us in 120 days with nothing changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| But, you know, I'm certainly willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| You could postpone it longer than that as long as nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| Actually, it's 120 days from when MPC heard it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| Go back and figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| Anybody want to do the math?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Well, it just seems a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| We can ask our secretary to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| It just seems a shame for him to lose his fee if it is not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| Yeah, it's probably inevitable under the circumstances, but we can try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| Give it back to him out of your tool, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| January 11th, MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| I think it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| Okay, January 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| 120 days from January 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| It would be February, March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2673)|

| 0:44:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| We wouldn't do any harm to do that just in case something happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2696)|

| 0:45:08| I think Councilman Holcomb is probably right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| I mean, the chances are slim, but it's worth a shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2710)|

| 0:45:18| I'll put a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2718)|

| 0:45:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| It's Old Callahan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| Of course I have to be opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| I'm concerned about development up there, straw happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| You've all heard this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| In this case, it's an interesting one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| I had a good conversation with Mr. Donaldson that the use here is probably real good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| The zone is a scary one because they get a zone that allows a shopping center to go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| even though the use that's coming up here is probably legitimate for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| I'm probably going to vote against this one just because I'm real concerned about straw in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| But I wanted to just share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| Councilman Huckless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| Well, I haven't pulled up the aerial photo or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| It takes a little too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| But just looking at the map in our packet, it looks to me like it's backed up into the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| It's sort of the rear of that parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| So to do C6 up into that slope means that we're probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| since we don't have any statutory slope protection in this city right now, I tend to go with Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2801)|
| 0:46:51| I don't think that it's something I can support under the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| Any other comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=2816)|

| 0:51:19| and done up in appropriate fashion and form and with the appropriate signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| And just for the council record to say maybe we can take maybe just a few moments of silence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3084)|
| 0:51:30| in honor of poor boy because he might have been here tonight saying a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| Almost like he's asking for extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| Well, as a matter of fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| that was one of the things that everybody kept talking about at the funeral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| that he'd always ask for the extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| But maybe just a few moments of silent reflection for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| And, actually, thanks for his service to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| If we'll take a few moments now at an appropriate time, I will call an end to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3109)|
| 0:52:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| Councilman Bailey, would you like to add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| Yeah, Mayor, just like Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| You know, I'd heard of poor boy Brown for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| You know, and then he would come up here in the middle of council and come along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| and shake hands no matter what was going on and work his way around there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| and then, you know, stay out here and wait the whole council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| and get up there and share his views with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| And, you know, he had convictions, and I think, you know, we need more people like him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| and I'll always remember him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| And, you know, he's got a special place here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3153)|
| 0:52:56| And for caring so much about Knoxville, and, you know, in reading his obituary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| and reading the comments about his life that his daughter shared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| good thing for us to all, you know, kind of take to heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| He really liked that label, poor boy, and he remembered who he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3188)|
| 0:53:15| My father-in-law used to say to his children, remember from whence you came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| And I think he always did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| And, you know, a lot of us don't do enough of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| and it does make a difference in how we live our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| So, you know, poor boy, I know you're checking in on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3209)|
| 0:53:40| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| Yeah, poor boy, you know, poor boy, he would name it to you, but he wouldn't yell at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3223)|
| 0:53:50| He would say it with class, he would say it calmly, but he would say it with conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| I mean, it's easy for people to get up and raise their hands and beat on the pulpit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| but it's different if you're able to state your case without having to raise your voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| to get your point across without having to point a finger at somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| and allowing you to read between the lines of what he was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| because he would speak often on different levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| And what he said was very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| I might add as one final note, Vice Mayor Brown is being humble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| Out of a multitude of speakers, he was, if not the most eloquent among them, and he did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| He represented all of us very well, and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| We have two or three folks signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| I think at least one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| I think Betty Burks may have left already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| Dr. Mathis, are you still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| Betty Burk had called me, and I talked to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| And she was here earlier, and I told her that I would speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| She was here to say that she wanted us to consider where the fire was for the bus transit center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3298)|
| 0:55:05| And so I wanted to make sure and pass that along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| She had to catch an early bus, and I told her I'd do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| And we have heard that remark from more than a few folks, and we are considering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3311)|
| 0:55:18| We're full speed ahead and looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| I think, is Dr. Mathis still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| I think I saw him leave, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| Dr. Mathis, you anywhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| Mark Zimek, thank you for staying so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| Sorry to make you wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3334)|
| 0:55:43| Mark, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| You guys definitely put some overtime in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| Mark Zimek, 415 West Vine Avenue, Number 5, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902, right downtown here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3348)|
| 0:55:54| Wrote down good evening, but it's almost good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| But good evening, Mayor and City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| I live in a condo on West Vine Avenue that was less than 200 feet from the McLintock Warehouse fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3360)|
| 0:56:07| And after the wind shifted and engulfed Ernie Gross' business, the wind basically sent everything downwind to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3367)|
| 0:56:17| So we, in the condos, along with a major portion of the Old City, the 100 block of West Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3377)|
| 0:56:25| and the rest of Summit Hill area, had smoke fumes and some fallout from this unfortunate event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3385)|
| 0:56:32| And with this fallout, there is some shiny particles that were floating around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| And, you know, the condos like the Fire Street Lofts and the Sturkey Apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| the occupants were told to evacuate and go outside, and they milled around outside in this smoke and fumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3402)|
| 0:56:51| I think one of the most important things with government is one of the most important responsibilities of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3411)|
| 0:56:59| is to keep its people safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| In this case, safe from health hazards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| I think we all need to know what hazards we have been exposed to and possibly exposed to in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3424)|
| 0:57:13| especially during the demolition and the debris removal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| if we expect people to be comfortable with coming, staying, and living downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| And with this, there's been counter-dictating reports of the environmental health testing done after the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3444)|
| 0:57:32| And I seek to find what testing has been done and the results of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| Thanks, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| And I got your letter just today, and we started pursuing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| I talked to Chief Byrd a little bit before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| Air quality issues, you know, there are certain things we do jointly with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| Air quality issues are up to the Knox County Air Quality Board and Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| I'm not dodging your questions, but we will pursue to see what has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| And I've got your letter, and we will get back to you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| So I'm not dodging it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| We at the fire department are not set up to do air quality testing in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| And Chief Byrd, jump in here if I'm saying anything inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| But it's a fair question, and we will see what we can find out for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| There's still a lot of fallout on the ground that probably needs to be checked also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| I've called all the way around from EPA, you know, Region 4, all the way through the city, Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3497)|
| 0:58:26| It seems like nobody has tested this, and with all the people living so close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| Myself, you know, I'm personally very interested in what the results are on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3512)|
| 0:58:39| Has any testing have been done or any samples?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3519)|
| 0:58:45| I'll check with Knox County Air Quality Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| I don't know the answer to your question, so we will check with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| And then your point about ongoing, with ongoing debris, we will ask them to look into that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3530)|
| 0:58:55| Can I call your office in a couple days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| If you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| I've got your letter, and we have it down to pursue and respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| I got it this afternoon, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| Nothing else to come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| Thank you for hanging in there with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3549)|
| 0:59:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d2?start=3557)|
