| 0:04:34| Okay. So first I wanna say it's nice to see you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| You all may know that today's the last day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| of the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| So July 1st marks the official start of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| that you approved a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| It seems like a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| Anyhow, happy new year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| And I look forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| Happy fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| I look forward to working with you in the year ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| One thing that has affected our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| and a lot of other things as well is the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| So just real briefly, it's a big concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| We've had a big increase in COVID-19 cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| just in the last few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| I think at our last council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| just two weeks ago, Knox County had 102 active cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| And today we have 234 active cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| So we've more than doubled our active cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| in just the last two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| And you may know that those are skewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| in the younger age groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| and recovery rates have been good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| But Dr. Buchanan and others are very worried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| And so that is one of this big uptick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| And the concern that we do have community spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| is the reason that yesterday I signed an executive order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| that takes effect eight o'clock tomorrow morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| And my order mandates that masks be worn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| inside all city owned buildings, centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| public works complex, a convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| and other indoor property that the city owns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| leases or manages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| We know that wearing a mask is one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| that will mitigate the spread of this virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| Everyone should be wearing a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| inside all public buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| and in places where physical distancing is difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| It's common courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| It's common sense, it's common courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| And I know council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| are already heeding this common sense advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| So thank you for leading by example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| So I don't have explicit jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| to mandate this citywide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| but I do wanna lead by example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| and I will keep urging other leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| to take similar measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| We will have signs up at entrances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| reminding people of this new order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| And we are encouraging everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| to provide their own face covering or mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| It can be something very simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| that you create out of an old t-shirt or a bandana,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| or it can be a store-bought one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| If someone comes to do business in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| and they do not have their own mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| we'll provide one to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| There are a few exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| I'll just go over some of the most commonly asked about ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| and obviously you and members of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| can read the full text of it online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| Children under 12 do not have to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| The hearing impaired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| or those communicating with the hearing impaired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| do not have to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| And other certain medical conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| qualify for an exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| So we are trying to just do the best we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| to mitigate the spread of this virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| So thanks for getting the word out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| and a shout out to our communications team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| They've done a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| with getting the word out about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| and all the other best practices we can follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| to contain this virus best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| Next thing I wanted to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| was an update on police body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| I'm pleased to announce tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| that we have completed a significant step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| in our efforts to get police body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| As you know, in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| we began an open competitive process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| to procure body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| We evaluated several vendors for the body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| And this morning we selected our top choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| and now we begin contract negotiations with the vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| Once we reach an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| we'll be sending the contract right away to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| for your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| And we hope to have a contract to city council in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| The procurement process can be arduous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| So thank you for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| Thank you to Chief Thomas and her team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| as well as Penny Owens and the folks in purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| who have worked hard on this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| I know it is really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| to get these body cameras in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| It's also important that we get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| KPD officers want body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| The community wants body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| City council wants body cameras and I want body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| We're all eager to have these cameras out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| and on officers as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| And we're working hard to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| Fourth of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| I wanna wish everybody a safe, healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| and happy Fourth of July this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| While I will miss celebrating with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| at the city's annual festival on the fourth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| at World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| we know due to COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| it was impossible to safely hold this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| So instead of a large gathering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| we are having an alternative event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| and it's called Neighborhood Trails of Red, White and Blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| 10 local neighborhoods are competing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| to have the most decorated porches and yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| And you can go to knoxvilletn.gov| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| to find a list of the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| and how to visit them this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| I wanna give a special thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| to Judith Foltz, Elaine Frank and Kendra Brewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| in our special events office for being so creative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| and adaptable during the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| As you can imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| they have a very different looking role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| when events are being canceled and not scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| So thanks to them and to the great team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| in the office of neighborhoods for sparking the new idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| for how to celebrate this Fourth of July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| and how to help our community have a fun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| and safe celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| So just as a reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| whether celebrating at home or with family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| remember that this year staying safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| means practicing the five core actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| wear a mask, practice physical distancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| wash your hands frequently, sanitize surfaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| and stay home if you feel sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| I told Dr. Buchanan that at the end of the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| I was gonna give her a plaque with that inscribed on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| because she says it more than anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| and I try to echo her wise counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| So that's it for my mayor's remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| Are there any reports of council members or committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| Yes, this kind of segues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| I think some part off of the Fourth of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| There's been a flurry of fireworks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| already in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| I'm getting quite a few complaints about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| And in case people don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| it's against the law for individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| to shoot fireworks within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| That law was passed back in 2011| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| when I was on council before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| I was one of the council members that supported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| If you wanna shoot fireworks and don't like the ban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| you can blame me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| But I think we just need some clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| that it is against the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| And the kind of complaints that I'm getting from neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| is basically, it adds up to a serious thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| Some people don't think that fireworks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| are that much of a deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| but I'm hearing things about sleep disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| One of the big issues is people are having trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| distinguishing between gunfire and fireworks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| It takes pretty trained ears to know the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| It's frightening the pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| Basically just air pollution and noise pollution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| and just generally making a not so pleasant atmosphere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| for a lot of neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| especially within the volume that we've been seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| But most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| and the real drive to pass this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| was because it's a fire hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| And if Chief Sharp is available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| I would like for him to address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| and maybe also talk a little bit about what neighbors can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| that are hearing fireworks in their area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| Chief Sharp, can you unmute yourself and let us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| Good, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Yeah, that was a great introduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| and a review of our ordinance on fireworks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| With us, it is primarily a public safety concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| not just a noise concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| And every year we have fires started by fireworks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| everything from grass fires, brush fires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| to dumpster fires and even house fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| So it's a serious issue for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| It's not only an issue here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| it's an issue nationwide with thousands of fires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| started by fireworks every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| and thousands of injuries that send people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| to the emergency departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| The best practice is just to leave the fireworks displays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| to professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| And if there are fireworks going off in your neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| obviously if there's a fire, call 911 and we will respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| But if it's just otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| you just call KPD's non-emergency dispatch number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| and that's 215-4010, 215-4010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=801)|
| 0:13:28| But again, if there's a fire, call 911 and we will respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=808)|
| 0:13:35| Thank you, Chief Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| I just wanted, yeah, thank you, Chief Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| And I just wanted to add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| I realize a lot of people think fireworks are a lot of fun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| but within the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| it's more appropriate when we can do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| through city controlled events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Unfortunately, that's another thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| that the pandemic has kind of put on chill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| but I hope in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| sometimes we might be able to have events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| that are supervised and the public can enjoy fireworks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| but not on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| Thank you, Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| Are there any other reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=848)|
| 0:14:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=855)|

| 0:22:44| Councilwoman Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| Since our last meeting, I have received the remaining balances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| in the accounts for these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| and it brought some questions to mind for me about the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1376)|
| 0:23:05| I guess, the way we approach this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1385)|
| 0:23:13| I imagine that the purpose behind the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| is to give notice for what the city anticipates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| will be prioritized spending, capital spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| over the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| But of course, as was stated in our last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| we're not committing to those future amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| The budget numbers, budget figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| are passed during the budgeting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| However, if there is a project with a significant amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| in the remaining, you know, in a remaining balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| like, for instance, the severe avenue improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| in the plan, it shows up as a million for the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| Total project cost a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| But we've learned recently that in the remaining balances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| there's $10 million there still to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| spent towards that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| I'm just curious about the transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| of the whole process, honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| and how this information is made aware to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| Is our planning board even aware of those remaining balances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| when they're making their decisions about this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| Those are my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| Mr. Evans, could you address the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| Ms. Parker was raising, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| Yes, ma'am, particularly as it pertains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| to the severe avenue project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| The, that $1 million, it's hard, it is hard to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1495)|
| 0:25:03| But that $1 million is almost like a project within a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| because it's dealing with underground utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| for that area that we had looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| at using some state funds for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| The remaining balance for the entirety of that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| really doesn't have anything to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| with that particular piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1529)|
| 0:25:36| Trying to find something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| But, and the remaining balances in various projects are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1538)|
| 0:25:49| I mean, yeah, there may be a certain amount in one month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| but the very next month, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| that changes because that money is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| well, it's being spent down for the various projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| that were appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| So it's already encumbered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| A lot of it, they are just committed, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| Use the federal vernacular, just committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| But the money is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| It's been appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| But no, it hasn't been, once it becomes encumbered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| then it is no longer, no, it won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| show as a remaining balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| Once it's either dispersed or encumbered, either one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| it's no longer a remaining balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| Council Member Parker, maybe one thing we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| is you could sit down with Mr. Evans and maybe Mr. Brace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| and go over this in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| And then if you have some ideas about how we could make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| it more transparent, we can try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| What I've got here, too, just I found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| what I was looking for in my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| The Severe Avenue one shows a balance of $10,690,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1628)|
| 0:27:15| But a project cost of $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| The reason for the cost showing less than the balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| is due to the project already having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| a balance to cover the original intended project cost, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| was that $10 million, actually more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| The new project cost for underground utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| that were not covered in the DDOT funding of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| in other words, that $1 million was requested and approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| for FY21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Otherwise, we'd show a balance of $10 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| but a project cost of the original cost plus a new cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| It is rather complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| That is probably the hardest one, Councilwoman Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| on that information that I provided you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| to explain of all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| But so yeah, it might be better if I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| be happy to sit down and particularly discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| that one or any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| It's also more of a planning document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| than a financial document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Oh, this is, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| This is definitely a planning document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| It's not a budget document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| And so what is the planning process for the $10 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1710)|
| 0:28:37| Well, that has already been, because of the remaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| balance there, it's already been appropriated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| in a previous budget for the work that is to go on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| And without digging through a bunch of paperwork here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| I don't have that right in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| Redevelopment might be able to speak to it a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Can I, Councilwoman Ryder, did you want to ask a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| I just was going to say, could Stephanie Welch or Dawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| Michelle or somebody speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| It's my understanding that the line items are showing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| we've approved balances in the past for projects that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| may still be in the queue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| And the money hasn't been spent because they're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| in right-of-way acquisition, negotiations with TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| each of these various different projects, some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| take many years more than anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| because of all of those factors, right-of-way, TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| railroads, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Things don't get necessarily spent in the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| So I wonder if somebody from development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| can elaborate on that and clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| Yeah, if Stephanie Welch or David Brace or Dawn Michelle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| I know you guys are all on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| So whoever wants to, Erin, you just revealed yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| So if you want to say a few words, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| Yeah, let me first, and I want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| if I miss that voice, you jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| But you're correct, Lauren, if we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| talking about a project balance, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| is a number that reflects money that has already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| been allocated and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| That number, a balance number, is in no way speculative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| That is a balance that is accounted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| for based on an approved budget either this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| or in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| The capital improvement plan is a fully speculative document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| And the way that I refer to it, and this may be too casual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| is somewhat of a wish list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| So it is a as comprehensive as we can make it document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| that reflects the things that we might someday want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| And a critical reason for making it a very inclusive document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| that encompasses the full list of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| that departments identify in the budget process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| as looking ahead over a five-year course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| is so that should we find ourselves with funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| to do something that we did not anticipate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| perhaps grant funding that's specific to a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| unique purpose, if something is not in the capital improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| plan, we cannot fund it, even if the money were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| to find itself available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| So there's an element of planning and looking ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| and being very inclusive and comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| as we think about potential projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| even with the recognition that when we begin a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| process, a budget planning process for the fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| that we're starting at zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| And we're building out based on critical needs and the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| urgent of needs, knowing that what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| we may have put in the capital improvement plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| may not be as relevant in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| when we start that project as it was a year prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| Thank you, Ms. Gilmour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Ms. Parker, does that answer your questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| Yeah, I think that I'll definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| follow up with Boyce and others because to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=1921)|

| 0:38:47| 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| OK, we first will start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| There's just one person signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| to speak in favor of this appeal, Robert Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| Mayor, Mr. Tomlinson is also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| I sent him the link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| He was the original applicant, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| And he is on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| Anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Speaking in favor of the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| We can ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| I'll enable him to speak so he can let us know his position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| He didn't sign up in advance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| Well, he was the original applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| I sent him the link because of defaults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| Mr. Tomlinson, we've enabled you to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| I didn't know what position you were taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| Yes, I am the original applicant to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| But the lawyer was going to confront his argument to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2375)|
| 0:39:45| all today, not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| OK, so we just have one speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| And it's Mr. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| OK, Mr. Cole, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2393)|
| 0:40:02| Yes, ma'am, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| OK, then you have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| Mr. Cole, if you could start by stating your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| for the record, and then I'll start the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| And Mayor, we were going to attempt to do the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| If you want to attempt to do the timer, that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| Well, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| Can all you see is just the timer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| Yes, I just see a big clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| So you're going to operate it, and I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| to just listen to the speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| Mr. Cole, can you state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| So far, we can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| Is he on the telephone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| No, he's raised his hand, and I've enabled him to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| He spoke before the meeting began to confirm his audio was working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2452)|
| 0:41:02| Well, Mr. Cole maybe needs some tech support or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2462)|
| 0:41:10| I would suggest he call the office or call the phone number on the invitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| if he cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| You can see him among the participants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| Yes, he is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| Mr. Tomlinson has raised his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| Mr. Tomlinson, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| Yes, so basically our client has, until Mr. Cole is available to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2494)|
| 0:41:41| he has the opportunity to own the ground underneath the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2501)|
| 0:41:53| So are you speaking on your taking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| I mean, you can have up to three speakers speaking in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| So are you speaking to the subject right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| or are you just telling us about whether he's going to be able to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| No, for Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Yes, for Mr. Clark, to the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| So you're speaking about the case right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| OK, well, let me start the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| Mr. Johnson, you should start the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| And then just start your remarks by stating your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2540)|
| 0:42:20| And I guess here's the attorney representing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| I am Aaron Tomlinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| I'm the surveyor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| I am speaking in response to Mr. Bill Clark and KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2549)|
| 0:42:37| And I hope to convince you of the, or just to show you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2557)|
| 0:42:49| what's going on in the project itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| Mr. Clark has overbuilt his property, and KUB recognized that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| KUB, on the other hand, has decided that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| would like to sell him the property underneath the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| underneath the structures that he has built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| Those, in turn, are illegal when it comes to terms of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| But in turn, KUB would like to sell that property to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| They have an agreement in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| But in turn, that does not meet the zoning qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2605)|
| 0:43:33| There are several qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| I do not have those in front of me at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| Well, actually, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| But there's eight qualifications when it comes to, in terms of setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2619)|
| 0:43:51| impervious areas, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| All my client would like to do is to own the property underneath his structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2635)|
| 0:44:02| that he has erected over the many years that they have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| And that's all that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| There's not going to be anything else erected or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| He just wants to own the ground underneath him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| And I think that would take the liability off of KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| and put that on Mr. Clark himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| And that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| OK, thank you, Mr. Tomlinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| Any word from Mr. Cole on his ability to participate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2674)|
| 0:44:41| Mr. Clark's ability to participate, I think, would be none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2681)|
| 0:44:52| Is Mr. Clark the correct name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| In my list, it said Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| Mr. Johnson, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| Anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| Is that not accurate, Mr. Tomlinson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2700)|
| 0:45:10| OK, maybe we'll go to discussion by council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| And if Mr. Cole or Mr. Clark, the person who ever signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| Mr. Clark is unable to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| All right, so Mr. Tomlinson is the only speaker signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| Is there anyone representing the building or zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| the building department, to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| Yeah, Mr. Ahrens, could you speak to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| from your perspective and review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Building Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| This is a situation where the property owner continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| to erect accessory structures without any permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| even so far as to go beyond this property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| and go on to KUB property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| In doing so, he has exceeded the allowable size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| of accessory structures, has exceeded the allowable building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2764)|
| 0:46:11| coverage for the zone, and he has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| exceeded the amount of impervious coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| for the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| And so when going to the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| the board recognized that he created his own hardships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| and denied the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2788)|
| 0:46:36| I don't think the transfer of property from KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| to this property owner really should come into play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| with your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| But that's really the background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| and I'm happy to answer any specific questions you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| Thank you, Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| Ms. Ryder, did you have a follow-up question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| Well, I've reviewed the case, and I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| reviewed the transcript from BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| And what we have is the zoning, everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| keeps referring to the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| The building standards require setbacks for safety and fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| safety for adjoining property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| When you encroach into those, you impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| you have to have things like firewalls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| and fire rated walls to protect neighboring properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| I know these are outbuildings, but Mr. Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| to clarify and just to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| this is a case of where someone not only built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| into the setbacks that are required for safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| on their own property, but then they built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| onto the adjoining property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| And what is being proposed is that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| can purchase the land they built on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| but not enough land to meet the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2879)|
| 0:47:59| Anything that's constructed within five foot of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| line has additional building code regulations for fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| And they have not proceeded down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| far enough for us to evaluate the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| methods and materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| And so that's to be determined, whether those structures are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2896)|
| 0:48:23| adequate and code compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| Typically, speaking in generalities, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| The typical construction methods are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| appropriate when you're within five feet of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| line due to the fire ratings that are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2915)|
| 0:48:42| And so, go ahead, Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| OK, and just before I hand the mic over to anyone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| I just wanted to say, I'm going to be making a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| to deny the appeal, because in reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| the standards for variance, the variance, a legal variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| is based on exceptional narrowness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| or topography of a siting, not a created hardship, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| is the case in this particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2944)|
| 0:49:11| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| I'm making a motion to deny the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| but there are other council members that have to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| Ryder making a motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| I will second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| Motion seconded by Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| Ms. Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| So I have a few questions for Director Aarons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| I saw in there, so initially it said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| these structures have been there for 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| It looks like it's closer to 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| Can someone confirm how long they've been there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| That would be, we don't have accurate records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| of how long they've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| We can look at KGIS history to speculate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| but that would be something that the property owner would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| be able to articulate in greater detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| And then what would, so should this appeal be denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| what are next steps for evaluating these structures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| And then what are, what's the potential outcome?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| Are these structures going to be deemed to be torn down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| Yes, ma'am, they would need to be removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| because all of them at this point are illegal structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| and they've not been evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| Well, they've been evaluated for zoning right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| but they've not been evaluated for construction methods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| and materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| And so as a minimum, all of the illegal structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| would need to be evaluated for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| once we require the removal of enough structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| to come into compliance with the maximum accessory structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| size, the maximum building coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| and the maximum lot coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| once we narrow it down to that level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| we can look at the existing structures that remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| to make sure that if they are within five feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| of the property line that they are compliant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| with the building codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| And that's something that we would have to work through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| with the property owner and his team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| to see, there's several,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| there's multiple structures out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| So he's probably got a lot of options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| as to which ones he wants to remove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| And that's something that we would work with him on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3083)|
| 0:51:29| And then just based on his age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| it sounds like he's approaching nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| He's pretty elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| I guess my question was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| should something happen to the property owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| I guess I was just, as far as a new owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| So I guess all of that would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| should the property be sold in the interim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| before all of this is concluded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| So if the property is sold in the interim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| it's already on our radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| And so we will follow up with the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| That's, yeah, that's what we would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| If we found that the property did exchange hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| we would hopefully, now that this issue is in our books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3132)|
| 0:52:19| any transfer of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| the title search would pull this information up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| so the new owner wouldn't be surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| But we would follow up with the next owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| Again, I mean, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| I think he's created this hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| I guess I just, it sounds like there's quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| of square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| So as far as tearing down those structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| that have been built, that have been there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| I struggle with that a little bit, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| Thank you, Ms. Testerman and Ms. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| Mr. Herons, this may not be relevant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| but how did this come to be before the zoning appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| I mean, the structures have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| How did this come to our attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| that he then needed variances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| It's my understanding that somebody complained to KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| and then KUB initiated everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| which domino effect, the property owner came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| Okay, I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| but it was complaint driven by a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3213)|
| 0:53:33| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| Mayor, we do have raised hands for Mr. Cole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| and Mr. Tomlinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| I don't know if he's able to speak now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| but we can call on him if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| Okay, I mean, Mr. Tomlinson already had his five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| and we don't have someone speaking on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| but Mr. Cole or Clark, is it Cole or Clark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| Clark was the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| Anyhow-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3243)|
| 0:54:03| Mr. Cole is representing Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| Well, if Mr. Cole can enable himself to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| then he did sign up and-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| He can have him speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| Mr. Cole, we've enabled you to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| Up to Mr. Cole, are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| I believe he's continuing to have issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| He just muted himself again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| I would like to call Mr. Tomlinson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| only to get his address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| I failed to get it from him earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| Mr. Tomlinson, can you unmute yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| and give us your address, please, for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| Yes, so Mr. Clark had built these structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3283)|
| 0:54:49| years in the past, at least a decade or more in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3289)|
| 0:54:55| Do I know what reason he built them for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| I'm assuming that he built them for his own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| to have a garage sitting out there in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| Did he know he's over the property line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| I do not know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| I'm assuming that he did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| Maybe he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| But his intent at the time now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| is to buy the property from KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| underneath the property which he has encroached upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| And KUB is only willing to sell the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| in which the structures are erected upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| And he is more than willing to buy that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| And because it does not reach the zoning requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3338)|
| 0:55:46| I mean, if it needs to reach the zoning requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| he will buy the property upon the zoning requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| which is what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| Mr. Thomson, could you provide your address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| I'm sorry, what's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| Could you provide your address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| your business address or some kind of address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| We always, when people speak before council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| we get their name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| I'm at a PO Box 18435 of Knoxville, Tennessee 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3371)|
| 0:56:17| That's my business address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| Okay, if council members have more questions for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| we'll know who to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| Council member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| So we don't have anybody from KUB in the meeting, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3387)|
| 0:56:33| They were invited, but I believe they declined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| to be present or they didn't need to be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| It's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| So it's my understanding from reviewing the records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| in our packet that the BZA did hear from KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| And this isn't one variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| It's my understanding that this is multiple structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| that encroach on properties both and into the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| on multiple sides of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| not just into KUB's side and that KUB is only willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| to sell where the building sits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| because it goes into the power line area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| and it's a safety thing that they can't sell more land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3441)|
| 0:57:30| because it would put them selling the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| underneath the transformers and that's not an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| And from reviewing the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3460)|
| 0:57:47| it's not just the rear setback into KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| It's multiple variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| And there's multiple carports here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| I believe there's four or five structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| that create the need for the eight variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| that have been requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| which involves stormwater coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| And all of these were built without permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| So I just, it's a hardship that was created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3492)|
| 0:58:18| over a long-term by not getting permits for anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| and building on other people's properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| So I just can't support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| Okay, the motion to deny the appeals on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| Are there any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| Were there any other, any neighbors who complained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| other than KUB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| Are there other individuals involved in the complaint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3524)|
| 0:58:50| Mr. Aarons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| This is Peter Aarons again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| Director of Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| We don't go and track that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| The property owner came to us and we're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| we're kind of second party to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| KUB reached out to the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| I'm not sure who reached out to KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| It's our understanding that it was a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| We can speculate all night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| but as far as what the record shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| it was the property owner who reached out to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| and we're following up as we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| And just to clarify, was KUB when you say property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| but not the other property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| where the property is infringing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| The property owner who created this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| is the one that reached out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| KUB did not reach out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| KUB is a neighbor, but we've dealt with Mr. Clark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3589)|
| 0:59:55| and his team specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3600)|
| 1:00:01| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| Any further questions or comments, Ms. Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| I just wanted to say it's really clearly defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| if you look at page 142 of the packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| and 144 where it shows entire buildings not on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3615)|
| 1:00:24| and that if you were to give setbacks beyond the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| not built on the property, it ends up into the transformer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| So I'll close with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3631)|
| 1:00:38| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| Seeing no further discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| please conduct a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| The motion on the floor is to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| Yes, vote is a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| No, you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| Council Member Berto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=3657)|

| 1:07:17| Oh, that was, okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| That was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| That was the last one without an asterisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| Okay, public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| Council Members, we have three people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| First one is Bentley Marlowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| Mr. Marlowe, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| I am here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| Okay, Mr. Marlowe, please start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| And if Mr. Johnson, if you could bring up the clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| so we all are able to follow it at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| My name is Robert Bentley Marlowe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| and I'm at 322 Douglas Avenue over in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| I just wanted to remind everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| that we're still dealing with a rather large number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| of homeless individuals over under the bridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| along Blackstock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| Public service seems to be doing a pretty good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| at keeping them out from underneath the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| for lack of a better term, the shelf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| that's created by TDOT when they construct the bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| But they are still, I'm aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| allowed to mass there on what I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| is Norfolk Southern property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| But they are continuing to come into the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| and commit crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| Just last week, we had one of them come into Al's Market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| and chase the owner around the store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| with a pickaxe, threatening to kill him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| It's just yet another example of the lawlessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| KPD did a fine job responding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| and actually made an arrest of this individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| I have no idea what the sheriff will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| with this individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| or if there's any mental health services available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| But this individual is known throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| the homeless community as Cigarette Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| And I've got numerous videos, my interactions with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| He has told me that he's a U.S. Marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| He's told me that he's an FBI agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| He's said that he was in the National Guard the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| and he was protecting the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| But he's obviously a very troubled individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| and he is now escalated to endangering others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| And I hope that we can take a serious look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| at the situation under the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| and what all it's going to take to bring that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| back into some semblance of a civilized society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| because it continues to plague Mechanicsville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| and the other neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| and downtown area around Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| And that's all I have for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| Thank you, Mr. Marlowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4177)|

| 1:10:33| She is no longer on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200630?start=4233)|
