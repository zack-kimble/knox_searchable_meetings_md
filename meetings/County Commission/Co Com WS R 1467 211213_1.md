| 2:36:17| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9377)|
| 2:36:18| Do any of the passes wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9378)|
| 2:36:23| Does any commissioner wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9383)|
| 2:36:26| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9386)|
| 2:36:33| The vote is two ayes, four noes, and five passes, so that item fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9393)|
| 2:36:44| Madam Clerk, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9404)|
| 2:36:47| I don't believe there are any other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9407)|
| 2:36:51| Is there any further business to come before the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9411)|
| 2:36:54| Commissioner Ward, your light is on, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9414)|
| 2:36:56| Sorry, Commissioner Daly, I didn't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9416)|
| 2:36:58| You want to go first, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9418)|
| 2:37:00| Just a point of clarification, Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9420)|
| 2:37:04| This vote is, this resolution is off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9424)|
| 2:37:08| It's because it did not get the affirmative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9428)|
| 2:37:11| The affirmative was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9431)|
| 2:37:14| Just clarifying before we come in, we get a lot of phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9434)|
| 2:37:22| Commissioner Ward, I still have concerns from the ordinance from last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9442)|
| 2:37:27| Did you take that off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9447)|
| 2:37:29| Yeah, I removed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9449)|
| 2:37:31| Is there a reason why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9451)|
| 2:37:33| Because according to you, we're still open for a lawsuit on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9453)|
| 2:37:37| The reason was that it was clear that I wanted you to vote it up or down, one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9457)|
| 2:37:43| That has nothing to do with this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9463)|
| 2:37:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9465)|
| 2:37:46| I'd like to then re-sponsor that going forward, and I still want us to get an opinion on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9466)|
| 2:37:50| because if we're open for a lawsuit, I don't want us to be sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9470)|
| 2:37:53| If you don't want to sponsor it, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9473)|
| 2:37:55| I'll sponsor it for now, and still get an out, you know, ask the state to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9475)|
| 2:38:04| ask the state to give us an opinion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9484)|
| 2:38:08| If we're going to be sued, it's our responsibility to protect us financially from a lawsuit or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9488)|
| 2:38:15| You're going to get an answer from the judge, because that issue is part of the lawsuits that are pending right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9495)|
| 2:38:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9502)|
| 2:38:23| So you're going to get an opinion from the judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9503)|
| 2:38:26| and the Attorney General doesn't render opinions on anything that's under litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9506)|
| 2:38:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9510)|
| 2:38:31| What's the judge that's hearing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9511)|
| 2:38:33| It's up in Judge Hagerty's court, Chancellor Hagerty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9513)|
| 2:38:35| I'll go talk to Judge Hagerty then, and I'll talk to him first and then go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9515)|
| 2:38:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9522)|
| 2:38:43| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9523)|
| 2:38:44| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9524)|
| 2:38:47| First, I want everybody to keep, again, all those affected by the tornadoes in their prayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9527)|
| 2:38:53| and I guess I'm going to step on Charlie's toes over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9533)|
| 2:39:00| Congratulations to the Pow Panthers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9540)|
| 2:39:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9542)|
| 2:39:04| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9544)|
| 2:39:05| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9545)|
| 2:39:07| I really appreciate that concession, but we will be hearing this again later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9547)|
| 2:39:14| I'm sure we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| Commissioner, there's two things I want to make the body aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9556)|
| 2:39:20| I've been talking with Senator Massey over the past several weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9560)|
| 2:39:24| and the date that the legislative delegation is able to meet with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9564)|
| 2:39:29| for our concerns going into the legislative session is January 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9569)|
| 2:39:33| That is a Friday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9573)|
| 2:39:35| That's traditionally when we have done our breakfast or lunches on a Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9575)|
| 2:39:40| Drew has been working on a venue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9580)|
| 2:39:42| and right now we are scheduled January 14th at 8 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9582)|
| 2:39:46| at the East Tennessee Historical Society Museum up on Market Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9586)|
| 2:39:51| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9591)|
| 2:39:53| When will we review our priorities before going into that meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9593)|
| 2:39:57| Drew is going to send an email tomorrow to the commissioners starting that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9597)|
| 2:40:03| and we can add that as a discussion item at the end of next week's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9603)|
| 2:40:08| if everyone is agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9608)|
| 2:40:11| Also, looking ahead to February, Commissioner Schoonmaker pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9611)|
| 2:40:15| our commission meeting is on February 28th, the Monday's fall on the 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9615)|
| 2:40:21| so it's the latest it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9621)|
| 2:40:23| That puts our work session the week of the 21st, which is a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9623)|
| 2:40:28| We would normally have the work session on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9628)|
| 2:40:30| However, the main assembly room is not available on that Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9630)|
| 2:40:35| In the interest of this body doing its work sessions in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9635)|
| 2:40:39| it has been suggested that we move the work session up a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9639)|
| 2:40:45| which Monday is Valentine's Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9645)|
| 2:40:48| but this room is available on Tuesday, February 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9648)|
| 2:40:52| I'll look to my fellow commissioners to see what your pleasure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9652)|
| 2:40:56| I'm available the 15th already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9656)|
| 2:40:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9659)|
| 2:41:01| Drew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9661)|
| 2:41:03| Well, the 14th is not the holiday. The 21st is the holiday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9663)|
| 2:41:07| so it would normally be the 22nd, but if we could move it back a week to the 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9667)|
| 2:41:12| we can have it in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9672)|
| 2:41:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9674)|
| 2:41:18| Are we good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9678)|
| 2:41:20| Okay. I'll have Drew add it to the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9680)|
| 2:41:22| Any further business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9682)|
| 2:41:24| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9684)|
| 2:41:25| Oh, Mr. Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9685)|
| 2:41:27| Rules committee will be meeting January the 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9687)|
| 2:41:30| so if you've got any suggestions on a rules change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9690)|
| 2:41:33| please send them to Drew and myself so we can add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9693)|
| 2:41:38| January the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9698)|
| 2:41:41| Chair will entertain a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9701)|
| 2:41:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9703)|
| 2:41:44| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9704)|
| 2:41:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9705)|
| 2:41:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9706)|
