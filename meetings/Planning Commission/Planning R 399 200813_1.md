| 2:17:56| of the Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8276)|
| 2:18:00| because the site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8280)|
| 2:18:05| and the proposed variances and alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8285)|

| 2:18:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8320)|
| 2:18:42| We have several individuals who are opposing the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8322)|
| 2:18:47| One, two, three, I think three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8327)|
| 2:18:51| And so you will need to divide your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8331)|
| 2:18:54| Each person will have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8334)|
| 2:18:57| Applicant, would you like to go first or would you like the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8337)|
| 2:19:00| I'd like to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8340)|
| 2:19:02| Go ahead, Mr. Forester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8342)|
| 2:19:04| Taylor Forester, 1111 North North Shore Drive, Suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8344)|
| 2:19:12| I'm here on behalf of the applicant, W.C. Woodberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8352)|
| 2:19:16| On the parcel at issue, the proposal is for the development of 80 apartment units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8356)|
| 2:19:23| spread out between three separate buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8363)|
| 2:19:27| The site is over 30 acres and we are proposing to construct only 80 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8367)|
| 2:19:34| which I believe as Mr. Reynolds plan staff report provides that that only amounts to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8374)|
| 2:19:41| dwelling units per acres in the amount of 2.6 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8381)|
| 2:19:45| The property is zoned plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8385)|
| 2:19:49| Submit that multifamily use apartments are a permitted use within the plan residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8389)|
| 2:19:56| The proposed development plan conforms with plan residential zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8396)|
| 2:20:02| This development meets the standards for the development within the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8402)|
| 2:20:07| It complies with the development applies with the general plan and the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8407)|
| 2:20:13| And it will not draw the type of additional traffic into the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8413)|
| 2:20:17| that your standard single family development will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8417)|
| 2:20:22| Mr. Reynolds can comment on the exact number, but the proposed 80 units is substantially less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8422)|
| 2:20:30| than what was initially approved on a concept plan several years ago that has expired several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8430)|
| 2:20:38| years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8438)|
| 2:20:40| These studies show the traffic studies on apartment complexes versus single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8440)|
| 2:20:47| developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8447)|
| 2:20:47| The traffic studies show that single family developments have a much higher traffic count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8447)|
| 2:20:54| per day, the amount of trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8454)|
| 2:20:56| When we were last here in June, request a postponement in part to talk to some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8456)|
| 2:21:01| communities of residents of Edwards Place, but also to seek what we can do about getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8461)|
| 2:21:07| a separate access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8467)|
| 2:21:10| Exhausted every effort, every opportunity for a separate access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8470)|
| 2:21:16| And we've just been unsuccessful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8476)|
| 2:21:18| We went back to the residents of the Edwards Place and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8478)|
| 2:21:24| OK, this subdivision has suffered from a lot of a lot of issues, sidewalks, road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8484)|
| 2:21:30| amenities that weren't provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8490)|
| 2:21:32| There's problems with the sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8492)|
| 2:21:36| My client has offered and proposed multiple amenities to help and fund and construct to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8496)|
| 2:21:43| correct a lot of these issues, to provide a separate green space, to provide a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8503)|
| 2:21:48| swimming pool, to provide a community playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8508)|
| 2:21:50| Also, my client has promised and put this on a plat, put this in any kind of restricted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8510)|
| 2:21:57| covenant that any of the undeveloped land by this, any remaining undeveloped land, put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8517)|
| 2:22:06| a future permanent easement on it that prevents any future development of any kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8526)|
| 2:22:12| That will run with the land, whether this is sold, conveyed, transferred or later subdivided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8532)|
| 2:22:17| that there will be no future construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8537)|
| 2:22:20| But it's our position that based on the multifamily, the proposed use of multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8540)|
| 2:22:28| complying with the plan residential ordinance, that there really isn't a basis here that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8548)|
| 2:22:35| supports a denial of the proposed development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8555)|
| 2:22:40| And we request that you follow and endorse and approve staff's recommendation of approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8560)|
| 2:22:49| for the proposed concept plan and development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8569)|
| 2:22:53| I reserve any remaining time and I have my client here is available and our engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8573)|
| 2:23:02| Thank you, Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8582)|
| 2:23:04| We have three individuals that have signed up for comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8584)|
| 2:23:08| Mrs. Niermeyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8588)|
| 2:23:11| Niermeyer, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8591)|
| 2:23:12| Niermeyer, Mr. Ward and Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8592)|
| 2:23:17| Is Mr. Ward available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8597)|
| 2:23:20| Mr. Ward is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8600)|
| 2:23:21| I would defer to Johnny Caldwell first and then speak with any remaining time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8601)|
| 2:23:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8606)|
| 2:23:27| So, Mrs. Niermeyer, you all have five minutes, so watch the clock and make sure you leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8607)|
| 2:23:35| ample time for the other two individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8615)|
| 2:23:38| Please state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8618)|
| 2:23:42| Yes, it's Jessica Niermeyer, 7643 Cotton Patch Road, Corryton, Tennessee, 37721.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8622)|
| 2:23:50| Okay, so I'm a lifelong resident of Corryton, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8630)|
| 2:23:56| For the last 29 years, I've watched Corryton grow from a little small town that hardly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8636)|
| 2:24:01| anyone knew existed to what's now becoming a very attractive little hub that a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8641)|
| 2:24:06| people and developers are wanting to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| Just some quick facts, Corryton has a population of 12,916 people, 8.8% of which are considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8650)|
| 2:24:19| at poverty level and 24.8% of which have an income below $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8659)|
| 2:24:25| When you add those two together, you get 33.6% who are currently in need of truly affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8665)|
| 2:24:31| housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8671)|
| 2:24:33| I did a quick mortgage calculator to see how much house an individual who makes $30,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8673)|
| 2:24:38| a year could be approved for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8678)|
| 2:24:40| The answer was $90,000 based on perfect credit and less than $250 a month in other monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8680)|
| 2:24:47| debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| I then did a Zillow search to see all available houses for sale in the entire zip code of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8689)|
| 2:24:55| 37721 for less than $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8695)|
| 2:24:59| There was only one result, and it was a 1991 single-wide trailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8699)|
| 2:25:05| I also went as far to see if there were any rental homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8705)|
| 2:25:09| There were zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8709)|
| 2:25:10| So to say that Corryton has a significant truly affordable housing shortage would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8710)|
| 2:25:15| a significant understatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8715)|
| 2:25:20| I know my view is different from the majority in my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8720)|
| 2:25:25| A lot of the residents want single-family homes, but unless those houses are priced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8725)|
| 2:25:30| at $90,000 or below, we're not really addressing the needs that we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8730)|
| 2:25:36| So approving this plan would be in the better interest of the 33.6%, and that's where my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8736)|
| 2:25:42| opinion lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8742)|
| 2:25:44| I want Corryton to welcome all socioeconomic groups, but most of all, I want Corryton to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8744)|
| 2:25:49| help the residents that we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8749)|
| 2:25:52| In every development that's ever proposed, there's going to be some form of compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8752)|
| 2:25:56| that's going to have to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8756)|
| 2:25:59| Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world, so we can't get 100% of what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8759)|
| 2:26:05| I know the second access point was a significant lack here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8765)|
| 2:26:09| So on Agenda 23, we could actually require that a vehicular access to Lawgiver be a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8769)|
| 2:26:15| of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| Therefore, I ask that you approve this development, but only if we can get a condition on Agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8777)|
| 2:26:23| 23 for a vehicular connection to Lawgiver Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8783)|
| 2:26:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8787)|
| 2:26:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8788)|
| 2:26:29| Mr. Warren?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8789)|
| 2:26:31| I'll defer to you, Mr. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8791)|
| 2:26:34| Commissioner Phillips, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8794)|
| 2:26:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8796)|
| 2:26:37| Sir, I would like to state on the record that that was in support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8797)|

| 2:26:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| Sir, I'd like to make a note on the record that she is in favor, and she took up time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8811)|
| 2:26:56| from our opposition statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8816)|
| 2:27:00| We didn't give the allotted five minutes to oppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8820)|
| 2:27:03| I will extend additional time for the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8823)|
| 2:27:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8827)|

| 2:27:15| My wife and I were the first ones to buy here in Edwards Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8835)|
| 2:27:18| We moved in in April of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8838)|
| 2:27:21| We have seen every house built, every phase developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8841)|
| 2:27:25| We moved here from Harbison Plantation because we wanted to stay in this community and raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8845)|
| 2:27:29| our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8849)|
| 2:27:30| We wanted a long-term investment, a good school system for our kids to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8850)|
| 2:27:35| I have two daughters who graduated from Gibbs High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8855)|

| 2:27:44| Liza and I purchased this home as our retirement home and as an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8864)|
| 2:27:48| We bought in this concept of having three phases of single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8868)|
| 2:27:53| I retired from the Army 25 years ago, and I'm still here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8873)|
| 2:27:57| I retired from the Army after 25 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8877)|
| 2:28:02| We have moved around a lot and lived in many different styles of homes with mixed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8882)|
| 2:28:07| I was raised in Montgomery Village and a happy hauler, if you're familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8887)|
| 2:28:12| I would never have made an investment like this had I known we'd be sharing it with apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8892)|
| 2:28:16| complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8896)|
| 2:28:20| We polled the Edwards Place residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8900)|
| 2:28:23| 100% of all the residents who responded voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8903)|
| 2:28:29| We didn't want an apartment complex in our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8909)|
| 2:28:32| We're not saying we're too good for apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| We're saying that we made an investment, but we did not expect to share with apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8914)|
| 2:28:38| complex for many reasons, such as the apartment traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8918)|
| 2:28:44| We'll put a burden on the Edwards Place Boulevard with only one exit, one entrance, that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8924)|
| 2:28:48| kids ride their bikes on, that our wives walk and socialize on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8928)|
| 2:28:53| The very same road that our elderly residents who retired here walk around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8933)|
| 2:28:58| Bringing in an apartment complex will drive down the value in our homes that we have invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8938)|
| 2:29:02| in, and for some, their life savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8942)|
| 2:29:06| The apartments will only have a 35-foot setback from the small backyards of Forest Willow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8946)|
| 2:29:13| Imagine looking out your back window only to see a three-story apartment complex and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8953)|
| 2:29:18| a parking lot sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8958)|
| 2:29:20| This is not what they envisioned when they purchased their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8960)|
| 2:29:24| They built property fences, privacy fences, but with the three-story apartment complexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8964)|
| 2:29:31| towering over them, they would no longer have that privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8971)|
| 2:29:35| Something else to consider is noise issues that would come from the apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8975)|
| 2:29:42| We, the residents, are not opposed to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8982)|
| 2:29:45| We want it completed and finished in the way that we bought into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8985)|
| 2:29:49| Single-family development homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8989)|
| 2:29:51| Gibbs community is a great place to raise a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8991)|
| 2:29:55| My wife and I love walking around by our neighbors' homes, stopping and saying hello to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8995)|
| 2:30:00| neighbors, introducing ourselves to the new members of the little subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9000)|
| 2:30:06| Commissioners, please hear us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9006)|
| 2:30:07| I speak on behalf of the residents of Edwards Place subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9007)|
| 2:30:13| While we appreciate developers staying in neighborhood to construct amenities, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9013)|
| 2:30:17| all have to give up those amenities only to allow single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9017)|
| 2:30:23| In closing, again, we do not support the building of apartments in our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9023)|
| 2:30:29| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9029)|
| 2:30:30| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9030)|
| 2:30:31| Mr. Ward, would you have a minute left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| Would you like to talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9033)|
| 2:30:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9034)|
| 2:30:35| This is Mike Ward, 7626 Thompson School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9035)|
| 2:30:38| A lifelong resident of Gibbs who lived adjacent to this Edwards farm for 60 years, 28 on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9038)|
| 2:30:44| Carnage Road and 32 on Thompson School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9044)|
| 2:30:46| There has been community collaboration from various, not only at Edwards Place, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9046)|
| 2:30:52| connected property owners and people outside the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9052)|
| 2:30:55| The community took the initiative to reach out to the farm for collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9055)|
| 2:30:58| We had good Zoom calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9058)|
| 2:31:00| They shared their unsuccessful attempt to get a second entrance, and that really is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9060)|
| 2:31:04| something that has been, from previous comments before from commissioners, it was really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9064)|
| 2:31:09| a mandatory, a non-negotiable, and it's just not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9069)|
| 2:31:13| The traffic volume has been implied as being lower, but the road scheme has not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9073)|
| 2:31:21| completed, and so it's different than it was on the original plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9081)|
| 2:31:27| Called the developer to see if he'd be interested in doing multifamily units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9087)|
| 2:31:32| He said, no, that didn't fit their business model, which we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9092)|
| 2:31:35| So, just in closing, the property holds great promise for the community and the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9095)|
| 2:31:40| The demand for single-family homes in the area is extremely high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9100)|
| 2:31:44| Very simply, the plan is not a fit, the property is not a fit, and the business model is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9104)|
| 2:31:49| a fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9109)|
| 2:31:50| Given the location, lack of a subdivision, it's not the best placement for apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9110)|
| 2:31:55| That ought to be a part of a planned concept from the beginning, not an afterthought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9115)|
| 2:32:02| So, we'd like to be able to keep looking for a business model that fits the needs of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9122)|
| 2:32:05| the situation and respectfully request that you reject the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9125)|
| 2:32:11| Thank you, Mr. Ward, for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9131)|
| 2:32:13| Mr. Forrester, do you have anything you want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9133)|
| 2:32:15| You still have some time left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9135)|
| 2:32:18| Yes, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9138)|
| 2:32:20| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9140)|
| 2:32:23| Anytime, I guess, that I've been in front of planning commission on behalf of a client| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9143)|
| 2:32:29| that's wanting to develop a piece of property with multifamily with apartments, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9149)|
| 2:32:33| always opposition, there's always objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| Um, everybody has a conception that apartments are going to harm their community, harm their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9155)|
| 2:32:42| home values, and frankly, there just is no proof of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9162)|
| 2:32:47| There is no evidence of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9167)|
| 2:32:49| Yeah, as a way of example is Sequoia Hills here in Knoxville has apartments in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9169)|
| 2:32:56| I think everybody familiar with Sequoia Hills would, those home values have not suffered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9176)|
| 2:33:02| More recent apartments are the ones at North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9182)|
| 2:33:06| You have the single family residential development at the rear of North Shore Town Center that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9186)|
| 2:33:13| growing and prosperous and continues to have new homes built in it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9193)|
| 2:33:22| In regards to, seems like outside of just not wanting apartments, the majority of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9202)|
| 2:33:27| objection has focused on traffic, and again, whether it's, you know, the traffic study we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9207)|
| 2:33:35| submitted, whether it's planning commission or Knox County Engineering that could substantiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9215)|
| 2:33:39| this, it would be our position that compared to what the community or Edwards Place says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9219)|
| 2:33:48| that they would like to have here, single family residential units built out at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9228)|
| 2:33:54| approved density. We continue to submit that if traffic is a large concern or an equal concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9234)|
| 2:34:02| that that traffic is going to be substantially increased under such a development scheme,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9242)|
| 2:34:08| unlike the one that we're proposing here today. Again, request you follow staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9248)|
| 2:34:16| and approve the concept plan with the five conditions and the development plan with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9256)|
| 2:34:21| five conditions. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9261)|
| 2:34:30| Yes, I have a couple of questions. One would be for the planning staff, not to jump ahead to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9270)|
| 2:34:36| item 23, but just to recap, that developer was not interested in connecting to this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9276)|
| 2:34:44| correct? That is correct. And the second question would be for the applicant. Are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9284)|
| 2:34:53| open to considering extending the cul-de-sac to Lawgiver Circle to create a semi-second entrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9293)|
| 2:35:05| Can you hear me? Yes. I think my client representative, Tom Simons, is on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9305)|
| 2:35:12| Zoom call as well. Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9312)|
| 2:35:31| While we wait for connection, Mr. Reynolds, did you have some comments you'd like to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9331)|
| 2:35:37| Mike, could you unmute yourself, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9337)|
| 2:35:45| Thank you for that reminder. Yes, thank you. I need to make one correction, and I apologize to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9345)|
| 2:35:52| Mr. Taylor. In my staff report, I mentioned that I felt, I believe that the apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9352)|
| 2:35:59| units would end up with less traffic in the development, but I was corrected today by our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9359)|
| 2:36:05| traffic engineer, Taryn Barrett, that this development, actually, it would end up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9365)|
| 2:36:09| slightly more traffic. Am I muted? Can everybody hear me? Yeah, you're fine. Okay, good. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9369)|
| 2:36:19| sorry. So, anyway, I was corrected today that this development would actually create just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9379)|
| 2:36:27| little bit more traffic than the single-family houses that would be developed. Taryn might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9387)|
| 2:36:35| able to address it in more detail than I can, but I just wanted to make that correction real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9395)|
| 2:36:39| and I apologize to Mr. Taylor for the information that I had in correcting my staff report that he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9399)|
| 2:36:45| been providing to the Commission. Thank you, Mr. Reynolds. Commissioner Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9405)|
| 2:36:52| Am I on? Can you hear me? We're connected. Yes, sir, we are connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9412)|
| 2:36:57| I'd like to respond to some of the comments that the attorney made. When he mentioned North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9417)|
| 2:37:05| Town Center as having apartments, that's a designed community. It has commercial, it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9425)|
| 2:37:15| apartments, it has single-family housing. It was designed that way. It's supposed to be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9435)|
| 2:37:26| Regarding Sequoia Hills, I think Sequoia Hills can overcome anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9446)|
| 2:37:33| and I don't think there's any question about that. But even a month or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9453)|
| 2:37:41| when the largest house, I guess in Tennessee or at least in East Tennessee, wanted to change their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9461)|
| 2:37:49| zoning, we didn't go along with that. They know how to stop something, and they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9469)|
| 2:37:57| He also mentioned that there is no basis for denial. Well, I think too often we forget that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9477)|
| 2:38:05| one of our obligations is to protect the neighborhoods. And in bringing in these apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9485)|
| 2:38:16| I think that we are going against that, that we are not protecting the existing neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9496)|
| 2:38:23| We're giving in to something different. And it's not like the town center where they were planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9503)|
| 2:38:30| and everybody knew it was going to be there. These people invested, and I built some tons of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9510)|
| 2:38:40| houses for first-time homebuyers. And believe me, they are just as proud of their house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9520)|
| 2:38:49| no matter what they paid for it, as the people in Sequoia Hills are of their homes. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9529)|
| 2:38:57| we have an obligation to protect the existing neighborhood up here. I'm not in favor of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9537)|
| 2:39:03| apartments at all. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Graff. Mr. Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9543)|
| 2:39:11| Yes, thank you. You know, I've looked at this thing really hard, but I'm kind of in Dick Graff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9551)|
| 2:39:17| camp on that. I don't think it's appropriate to run that traffic through this neighborhood for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9557)|
| 2:39:23| the apartments. It's just, it doesn't gel with what the expectations were of these people when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9563)|
| 2:39:30| they bought their homes. And I think if the bank did not own this property, there would not be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9570)|
| 2:39:35| apartment complex being proposed on it. I think that has a lot more to do with this than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9575)|
| 2:39:41| There's lots of other land back there. If somebody wants to build apartments on some land that fronts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9581)|
| 2:39:46| on a main road, not through a neighborhood, I think there's probably several opportunities. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9586)|
| 2:39:52| I will not be supporting this. Thank you, Mr. Smith. I also want to note that I did drive out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9592)|
| 2:40:01| to the subdivision yesterday around two o'clock. Surprised about the number of cars that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9601)|
| 2:40:09| in the neighborhood, parked in the driveways, on the streets. Like a lot of us, they have more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9609)|
| 2:40:15| belongings than they have space. So they're using the garages for storage. So you have a lot of cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9615)|
| 2:40:22| on the streets and a lot of young children run around playing. I just think it's a poor decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9622)|
| 2:40:30| to try to run a apartment complex through a residential neighborhood. As the other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9630)|
| 2:40:38| have commented, that's not what they bought into. And I agree with Commissioner Graff. We need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9638)|
| 2:40:43| protect developments like this. They've had some challenges and we need to do everything we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9643)|
| 2:40:50| to make sure it's a successful community. Commissioner Corbett. Yeah, I have some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9650)|
| 2:40:59| to direct to, I think it's Mr. Forrester, the applicant's agent. I have your letter in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9659)|
| 2:41:08| of me, dated August 11th. And you have listed in this letter a number of opportunities or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9668)|
| 2:41:19| enhancements that you're willing to provide to the neighborhood. Just briefly, a common area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9679)|
| 2:41:26| with recreation opportunities for the residents of Edwards Place, roadway and sidewalk improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9686)|
| 2:41:33| 60-foot greenway easement, and installing an improved sewer system. And in addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9693)|
| 2:41:39| you are providing a connection, this is a little bit separate, but you are providing a connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9699)|
| 2:41:46| to Twin Oaks for students to walk to school. What I don't understand is from Edwards Place residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9706)|
| 2:41:58| this I thought answered many of their complaints and disappointments with the poor treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9718)|
| 2:42:04| they've had from developers in the past. Their sidewalks have been improved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9724)|
| 2:42:10| they would get the pool and the recreation facilities they were promised and then denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9730)|
| 2:42:17| and they would get the road and sewer improvements. So I guess as long as the apartment complex is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9737)|
| 2:42:24| well buffered, and I would recommend a few additional changes, but I don't see the apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9744)|
| 2:42:31| complex as a problem. But I don't understand why the Edwards Place is willing to give up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9751)|
| 2:42:37| all of the things they wanted to stop this when the traffic impact is roughly comparable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9757)|
| 2:42:46| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9766)|
| 2:42:49| Commissioner Boston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9769)|
| 2:42:51| Thank you, Chairman Phillips. I would like to also just speak to the fact that I believe this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9771)|
| 2:43:00| would be a very substantial impact to the Edwards Place residents. I think if they could have found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9780)|
| 2:43:11| another route for the traffic, it might be a possibility, but I still think the impact is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9791)|
| 2:43:21| too severe. I just, I believe like Commissioner Grass said, I just don't think the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9801)|
| 2:43:32| thought they were going to have an apartment complex this large in their subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9812)|
| 2:43:41| Thank you, Commissioner Boston. Commissioners, Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9821)|
| 2:43:49| Thank you, Chairman Phillips. I'd like to make a motion that we approve variances one and two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9829)|
| 2:43:53| and the alternative design standards based on the recommendations of Knox County Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9833)|
| 2:43:57| of Engineering and Public Works and because the site conditions restrict compliance with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9837)|
| 2:44:03| subdivision regulations and proposed variances and alternative design standards will not create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9843)|
| 2:44:08| traffic hazards. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9848)|
| 2:44:16| Before we call for the motion, Commissioner Eason. Yes, I have a question, one more question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9856)|
| 2:44:23| for clarification from staff, please. That the apartments versus the single family houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9863)|
| 2:44:30| did you say that the approximate design were just slightly more than the single family houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9870)|
| 2:44:36| for public sector peers? It was about 142 more car trips a day with the apartment complex and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9876)|
| 2:44:45| think that included what the traffic study included, which was about 22 additional houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9885)|
| 2:44:53| and if I'm mistaken, please let me know, but I think that was including 22 additional houses as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9893)|
| 2:44:59| well. Thank you. Yes, you are correct, Mike. Commissioner Corlick, you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9899)|
| 2:45:13| Yes, I am not going to vote for Commissioner Roth's motion because I want to offer a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9913)|
| 2:45:20| substitute motion or a motion afterwards, which is to delay any construction of the project until the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=9920)|

| 2:59:11| I live at 1528 Pine Springs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10751)|
| 2:59:14| Can y'all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10754)|
| 2:59:16| Okay, so this will be right in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10756)|
| 2:59:20| And my main opposition is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10760)|
| 2:59:22| that is not why I moved here in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10762)|
| 2:59:26| I have woods to the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10766)|
| 2:59:28| I do not wanna look out my back window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10768)|
| 2:59:30| and look into someone else's back window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10770)|
| 2:59:33| nor do I want them looking out of their window and see mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10773)|
| 2:59:37| The plan indicates there's a 35 foot buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10777)|
| 2:59:39| which I believe is not nearly enough to give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10779)|
| 2:59:42| what I'd like to have some tree cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10782)|
| 2:59:44| between the two neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10784)|
| 2:59:49| There are some mature trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10789)|
| 2:59:54| but the 35 foot is not gonna give us a barrier at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10794)|
| 2:59:57| And then secondary, my concern is around the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10797)|
| 3:00:01| on Bluegrass Road, which already has several blind curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10801)|
| 3:00:06| And I just see that as being very dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10806)|
| 3:00:08| supporting another 56 households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10808)|
| 3:00:12| And that's all I have to say at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10812)|
| 3:00:15| Ms. Bryant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10815)|
| 3:00:17| Yes, thank you very much commission for hearing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10817)|
| 3:00:21| I've lived here since 1986.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10821)|
| 3:00:23| I'm not against new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10823)|
| 3:00:26| I'm just concerned about the safety of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10826)|
| 3:00:30| For one thing, where the entrance and exit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10830)|
| 3:00:35| will come out of this subdivision floods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10835)|
| 3:00:38| even if it rains a little bit, it is always flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10838)|
| 3:00:43| We were not able to get in and out of our subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10843)|
| 3:00:48| anytime we've had a storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10848)|
| 3:00:50| So I'm really concerned about the flooding and the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10850)|
| 3:00:55| The traffic on Bluegrass Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10855)|
| 3:00:57| is disastrous right now already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10857)|
| 3:01:00| We have several blind curves as Bill has mentioned already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10860)|
| 3:01:04| We have the blind hills, severe curves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10864)|
| 3:01:08| and the entrance and exit to the proposed subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10868)|
| 3:01:12| is actually on one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10872)|
| 3:01:14| You come over a blind hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10874)|
| 3:01:16| and you're gonna come right into the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10876)|
| 3:01:18| of the new proposed subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10878)|
| 3:01:22| So I'm very concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10882)|
| 3:01:25| I'm also concerned about the springs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10885)|
| 3:01:29| and the water in the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10889)|
| 3:01:34| the watershed, the retention of water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10894)|
| 3:01:36| how they're gonna handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10896)|
| 3:01:38| There's the leveling and the existing plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10898)|
| 3:01:43| There's some hills and water runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10903)|
| 3:01:47| that I think is gonna be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10907)|
| 3:01:49| I really think that the 56 houses is major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10909)|
| 3:01:54| for the way that that land area is shaped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10914)|
| 3:02:00| If I were someone who was looking at buying a house there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10920)|
| 3:02:04| knowing how severe the flooding is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10924)|
| 3:02:06| I would not want to be able to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10926)|
| 3:02:09| in and out of that subdivision knowing I'll be cut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10929)|
| 3:02:13| I'm also concerned about the county needing to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10933)|
| 3:02:19| I feel like the county will have to do some road work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10939)|
| 3:02:22| to be able to make this even feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10942)|
| 3:02:26| There's no way that Knox County is going to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10946)|
| 3:02:30| to have 112 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10950)|
| 3:02:32| If every house has two cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10952)|
| 3:02:35| 112 cars coming in and out of that small place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10955)|
| 3:02:38| that floods at a small rain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10958)|
| 3:02:42| it's really gonna be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10962)|
| 3:02:44| Like Bill, that's gonna put us right to our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10964)|
| 3:02:48| Ms. Bryant, there are a number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10968)|
| 3:02:50| that wanna speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10970)|
| 3:02:51| Yeah, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10971)|
| 3:02:52| Give them time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10972)|
| 3:02:55| Mr. Graves, are you available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10975)|
| 3:02:58| Mr. Gentry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10978)|
| 3:03:11| Ms. Brooks, are these people still online?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10991)|
| 3:03:13| Yeah, Mr. Gentry is on, he is unmuted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10993)|
| 3:03:17| and I see his name listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=10997)|
| 3:03:20| Mr. Gentry, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11000)|
| 3:03:25| My apologies, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11005)|
| 3:03:26| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11006)|
| 3:03:28| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11008)|
| 3:03:29| My name's James Gentry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11009)|
| 3:03:31| I own and am the resident of 1434 Pine Springs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11011)|
| 3:03:36| My concerns are threefold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11016)|
| 3:03:38| I'm a retired military, and when I was in the military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11018)|
| 3:03:42| I worked on several engineering projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11022)|
| 3:03:45| and one thing I learned is water always wins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11025)|
| 3:03:50| The stream that's listed as running out of my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11030)|
| 3:03:54| into this proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11034)|
| 3:03:57| is not actually a intermittent runoff stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11037)|
| 3:04:00| It's actually a spring-fed stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11040)|
| 3:04:04| that is very active when the water table rises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11044)|
| 3:04:09| A large volume of water passes through that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11049)|
| 3:04:12| and contributing to the runoff created by the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11052)|
| 3:04:16| it will create a flooding hazard on Pine Springs Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11056)|
| 3:04:20| at the entrance of Bluegrass and Pine Springs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11060)|
| 3:04:25| The second consideration that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11065)|
| 3:04:28| is that it would also probably cause flooding on my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11068)|
| 3:04:32| and possibly flood out the house to the northwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11072)|
| 3:04:36| of the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11076)|
| 3:04:39| The second area of consideration is that of infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11079)|
| 3:04:44| I lived in my house when they put in the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11084)|
| 3:04:47| for the sewer system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11087)|
| 3:04:50| and based upon the plat scheme that I was presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11090)|
| 3:04:55| there are plot 11 and 12, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11095)|
| 3:04:59| since I am not looking at the design right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11099)|
| 3:05:02| would actually be built on top of the county sewer easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11102)|
| 3:05:06| which runs through my property and into the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11106)|
| 3:05:12| The last is the traffic issue that was articulated earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11112)|
| 3:05:17| Excuse my references, but I think in meters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11117)|
| 3:05:19| because of my military experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11119)|
| 3:05:22| that section of road on Bluegrass is about 200 meters long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11122)|
| 3:05:26| where it enters in Pine Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11126)|
| 3:05:28| There's always a collision hazard with westbound traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11128)|
| 3:05:32| due to coming around that blind turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11132)|
| 3:05:35| The addition of the entrance from this new subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11135)|
| 3:05:39| just meters away from the Pine Springs entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11139)|
| 3:05:43| would increase additional traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11143)|
| 3:05:45| and collision hazard on Bluegrass Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11145)|
| 3:05:48| Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11148)|
| 3:05:50| and your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11150)|
| 3:05:52| We have four other additional individuals like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11152)|
| 3:06:00| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11160)|
| 3:06:02| Could we possibly give the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11162)|
| 3:06:05| another three minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11165)|
| 3:06:07| If that's your request, then we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11167)|
| 3:06:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11169)|
| 3:06:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11170)|
| 3:06:12| Residents, if you could watch the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11172)|
| 3:06:15| because you have others that would wanna speak after you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11175)|
| 3:06:18| I've got one, Larry, but I'm not sure his last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11178)|
| 3:06:21| Is that available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11181)|
| 3:06:24| I don't see that person on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11184)|
| 3:06:27| And it's gonna be Miss Ken, I think, if I'm pronouncing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11187)|
| 3:06:31| Nicole Ken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11191)|
| 3:06:33| Yes, Nicole Ken, 1504 Pine Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11193)|
| 3:06:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11197)|
| 3:06:39| I would also like to just reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11199)|
| 3:06:41| what my fellow neighbors have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11201)|
| 3:06:43| 35-feet foot buffer is not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11203)|
| 3:06:47| I do enjoy the wooded backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11207)|
| 3:06:49| I'm not against development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11209)|
| 3:06:52| but a bigger buffer would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11212)|
| 3:06:55| I'm also concerned about the flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11215)|
| 3:06:57| and the traffic as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11217)|
| 3:06:59| So I don't need to reiterate all the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11219)|
| 3:07:01| that my fellow neighbors have already brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11221)|
| 3:07:04| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11224)|
| 3:07:04| Thank you, Miss Ken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11224)|
| 3:07:06| Mr. Douglas, is he available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11226)|
| 3:07:10| Yes, sir, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11230)|
| 3:07:12| All my neighbors, they've all hit the nail on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11232)|
| 3:07:17| They've all addressed my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11237)|
| 3:07:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11238)|
| 3:07:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11240)|
| 3:07:22| Mr. Davis, you have eight minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11242)|
| 3:07:27| Yes, I hope not to use up all that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11247)|
| 3:07:29| And Mr. Jim, we greatly appreciate your service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11249)|
| 3:07:32| to our country and appreciate what you've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11252)|
| 3:07:34| the sacrifices you've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11254)|
| 3:07:36| And I do understand the concerns as it relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11256)|
| 3:07:39| to water coming down through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11259)|
| 3:07:41| but the elevation of the homes in Pine Springs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11261)|
| 3:07:45| are anywhere from 25 to 40 feet above the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11265)|
| 3:07:50| where the creek bed is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11270)|
| 3:07:51| So the water would have to rise 35 to 40 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11271)|
| 3:07:55| to get anywhere close to encroaching on their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11275)|
| 3:07:57| But we also are responsible through engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11277)|
| 3:07:59| to manage the water as you all know through engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11279)|
| 3:08:03| In addition to the entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11283)|
| 3:08:04| we have certified site distance in excess of 300 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11284)|
| 3:08:07| in either direction, which is what is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11287)|
| 3:08:10| by Knox County in a 30 mile per hour speed zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11290)|
| 3:08:13| And I respectfully request your all's approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11293)|
| 3:08:15| for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11295)|
| 3:08:18| Thank you, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11298)|
| 3:08:19| Mr. Snowden with Knox County Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11299)|
| 3:08:23| do you have any comments regarding the flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11303)|
| 3:08:26| as well as the site visibility on the entrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11306)|
| 3:08:39| Ms. Brooks, is Mr. Snowden available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11319)|
| 3:08:42| I'm sorry, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11322)|
| 3:08:43| I was having trouble with the mute button on my mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11323)|
| 3:08:46| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11326)|
| 3:08:48| Yes, as far as the entrance that Scott is proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11328)|
| 3:08:54| we agree that available site distance is at that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11334)|
| 3:08:57| in excess of 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11337)|
| 3:09:00| And from a highway maintenance perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11340)|
| 3:09:02| we're not familiar with any routine flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11342)|
| 3:09:05| at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11345)|
| 3:09:06| We're showing an 18 inch pipe under the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11346)|
| 3:09:09| And as far as my historical knowledge here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11349)|
| 3:09:12| I've never seen a significant issue of road flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11352)|
| 3:09:16| at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11356)|
| 3:09:18| Thank you very much, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11358)|
| 3:09:20| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11360)|
| 3:09:22| Yes, my question is probably for staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11362)|
| 3:09:27| and not related directly to this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11367)|
| 3:09:31| I've had my hand up for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11371)|
| 3:09:34| Can you tell me what alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11374)|
| 3:09:40| are, is that a separate manual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11380)|
| 3:09:44| that we're going to leave the normal ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11384)|
| 3:09:48| that we work with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11388)|
| 3:09:50| And this is a whole different set of rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11390)|
| 3:09:54| that we're using, or I don't remember them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11394)|
| 3:09:58| from a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11398)|
| 3:10:01| Are they relatively new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11401)|
| 3:10:02| Just how do they fit in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11402)|
| 3:10:06| Yeah, they are relatively new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11406)|
| 3:10:08| It was, I can't remember if it was either early this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11408)|
| 3:10:13| or February this year, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11413)|
| 3:10:14| it was the subdivision regulations were amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11414)|
| 3:10:18| and there were several variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11418)|
| 3:10:20| that the planning commission would have to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11420)|
| 3:10:24| on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11424)|
| 3:10:25| And it was things that we didn't really feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11425)|
| 3:10:30| that would necessarily rise to the level of a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11430)|
| 3:10:34| Like requirement is something that staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11434)|
| 3:10:36| always felt comfortable recommending for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11436)|
| 3:10:39| So we've created a different category of approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11439)|
| 3:10:42| outside of variances called alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11442)|
| 3:10:45| So it's not a true variance that you're approving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11445)|
| 3:10:48| it's just something that staff reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11448)|
| 3:10:53| and then makes a recommendation to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11453)|
| 3:10:58| that these standards that they're proposing are acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11458)|
| 3:11:02| So it's not a true variance anymore for some of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11462)|
| 3:11:05| they're just called an alternative design standard now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11465)|
| 3:11:08| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11468)|
| 3:11:11| Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11471)|
| 3:11:13| Commissioner Korolek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11473)|
| 3:11:16| Yes, I have several questions for Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11476)|
| 3:11:19| The first one would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11479)|
| 3:11:21| would you identify for me the environmental constraint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11481)|
| 3:11:26| that is the reason that you asked for planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11486)|
| 3:11:30| and how you designed around to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11490)|
| 3:11:34| that environmental constraint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11494)|
| 3:11:37| And I apologize, I stepped away for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11497)|
| 3:11:40| Could you repeat, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11500)|
| 3:11:42| Oh, sure, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11502)|
| 3:11:43| I was asking Mr. Davis about the environmental constraint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11503)|
| 3:11:47| that PR requires that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11507)|
| 3:11:51| and how you designed around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11511)|
| 3:11:55| And I've been doing this a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11515)|
| 3:11:59| and when you say environmental constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11519)|
| 3:12:03| could you help, could you elaborate please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11523)|
| 3:12:06| The PR zone states that it's for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11526)|
| 3:12:09| I'm looking for the wording in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11529)|
| 3:12:12| but it's basically for where you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11532)|
| 3:12:14| an environmental constraint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11534)|
| 3:12:16| and then you have a creative design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11536)|
| 3:12:20| and that's why you need the flexibility and lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11540)|
| 3:12:23| to accommodate that environmental constraint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11543)|
| 3:12:28| I'm just wondering what your environmental constraint is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11548)|
| 3:12:30| for this PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11550)|
| 3:12:32| Twofold, one is the topography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11552)|
| 3:12:35| and the environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11555)|
| 3:12:37| the allowing for the alternative design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11557)|
| 3:12:41| was part of and came out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11561)|
| 3:12:43| the original hillside protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11563)|
| 3:12:46| And if a property has a portion of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11566)|
| 3:12:49| in the hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11569)|
| 3:12:50| then the environmental constraints are the topography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11570)|
| 3:12:54| as well as the shape of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11574)|
| 3:12:58| but primarily the topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11578)|
| 3:13:01| So the requirement is that you provide open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11581)|
| 3:13:08| which is usable for recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11588)|
| 3:13:11| Would you describe that to me as well, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11591)|
| 3:13:14| That is not a requirement in PR zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11594)|
| 3:13:18| It's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11598)|
| 3:13:20| No ma'am, that is a recommendation of PR zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11600)|
| 3:13:22| That is a recommendation of PR zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11602)|
| 3:13:26| That is not a requirement in PR zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11606)|
| 3:13:28| For a unified site design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11608)|
| 3:13:31| All right, well, that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11611)|
| 3:13:33| And then I had a couple more, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11613)|
| 3:13:36| I was wondering when you have the detention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11616)|
| 3:13:38| in the common area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11618)|
| 3:13:39| was any of that usable for open space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11619)|
| 3:13:43| If there is any of that usable for open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11623)|
| 3:13:45| we do not know until we do our engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11625)|
| 3:13:49| how much space that is going to require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11629)|
| 3:13:52| and all that is done via engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11632)|
| 3:13:55| And if there's available space there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11635)|
| 3:13:57| for common area playground, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11637)|
| 3:14:00| we will provide such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11640)|
| 3:14:02| And then my last question, Mr. Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11642)|
| 3:14:04| and thank you for your patience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11644)|
| 3:14:06| is that I see the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11646)|
| 3:14:10| I can't tell for this map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11650)|
| 3:14:12| if it does actually touch the Stafford Road right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11652)|
| 3:14:16| but I was wondering if there is a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11656)|
| 3:14:19| of getting a pedestrian easement to Stafford Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11659)|
| 3:14:22| from, well, between lots 37 and 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11662)|
| 3:14:27| Otherwise, to go from one subdivision to the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11667)|
| 3:14:31| it's a long distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11671)|
| 3:14:33| Is there a possibility of including a pedestrian easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11673)|
| 3:14:37| to Stafford Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11677)|
| 3:14:40| Not to my knowledge, because that's all private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11680)|
| 3:14:44| You would have to go to private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11684)|
| 3:14:46| See the little corner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11686)|
| 3:14:47| I can't tell if it actually touches the right or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11687)|
| 3:14:53| I'll kind of jump in a little bit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11693)|
| 3:14:59| Just from the parcel map on KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11699)|
| 3:15:02| it appears that Mr. Davis's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11702)|
| 3:15:05| does not touch Stafford Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11705)|
| 3:15:06| but it would probably take a true survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11706)|
| 3:15:10| to really find that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11710)|
| 3:15:11| or maybe the flats for that neighboring subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11711)|
| 3:15:16| might show whether or not his property touches that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11716)|
| 3:15:20| I don't believe it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11720)|
| 3:15:21| but that's just my...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11721)|
| 3:15:24| According to our survey, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11724)|
| 3:15:27| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=11727)|

| 3:22:16| three major areas of concern, stormwater runoff, road and traffic conditions, and historical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12136)|
| 3:22:22| preservation. First of all, with stormwater runoff issues, over the last several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12142)|
| 3:22:28| here at Covered Bridge, we've experienced a lot of increased stormwater runoff and soil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12148)|
| 3:22:32| erosion on our property, and the Covered Bridge Homeowners Association Commission and Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12152)|
| 3:22:38| Firm to do an existing condition stream survey of Connor Creek that flows through the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12158)|
| 3:22:44| side of Covered Bridge, and a couple of key findings there. One was that there's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12164)|
| 3:22:49| issues with East Gallaher Ferry Road where it needs to be, have some work done. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12169)|
| 3:22:54| yet to work with Director Snowden's group there, Jim, at Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12174)|
| 3:23:01| We'll be getting with you soon about some armoring work that will need to be done there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12181)|
| 3:23:06| where the water comes from the other properties already down the side there and is wearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12186)|
| 3:23:11| away at East Gallaher Ferry. But then another concern of ours, more so financially, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12191)|
| 3:23:18| our property that we own, the common property with the creek running through our beautiful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12198)|
| 3:23:24| area with a nice bridge, is we're going to have to have armament in those locations to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12204)|
| 3:23:31| prevent the creek banks from eroding and other vegetative type things planted to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12211)|
| 3:23:37| the erosion from happening. So we're going to have to pay our money to get some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12217)|
| 3:23:43| fixed because these other subdivisions that have been built are increasing the water flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12223)|
| 3:23:48| So our question is, why do we as homeowners have to bear the brunt of these adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12228)|
| 3:23:53| developments that have stormwater runoff on our property? Even recently, the Massey Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12233)|
| 3:23:58| development to our east, I guess it is, Salt Creek Lane, I think is the name of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12238)|
| 3:24:06| there, where they built the hills on the hillside there, they had to put a culvert under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12246)|
| 3:24:11| road because the water ran so hard over East Gallagher Ferry, it was causing hazardous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12251)|
| 3:24:15| driving conditions. However, that comes on our property into Connor Creek. So we're just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12255)|
| 3:24:23| kind of the property here in the corner that takes all the brunt of the newer development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12263)|
| 3:24:28| So our major concern is about that. In addition to that, we want some more questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12268)|
| 3:24:34| answered about the reforestation plan that's planned for this Seal Family property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12274)|
| 3:24:40| We appreciate the work that Mr. Fulgham and Hickey have already done in planning that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12280)|
| 3:24:44| we know they've done several iterations there. But even with these plans, we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12284)|
| 3:24:49| make sure that those are fulfilled to completion. And a question we have for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12289)|
| 3:24:55| is, does the county have any standards for reforestation, even to judge the validity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12295)|
| 3:25:03| of the plans that are out there? So those are just things we want to have more confidence in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12303)|
| 3:25:07| The other thing is about the common area that is planned to be reforested on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12307)|
| 3:25:14| beautiful property, above the 25% that they plan to disturb, the loss of the stabilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12314)|
| 3:25:20| land does not seem to compare to the proposed reforested area. So we'd just like for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12320)|
| 3:25:26| maybe in the comments by Mr. Fulgham and Mr. Hickey to clarify some of that for us too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12326)|
| 3:25:35| We have one-in-case situations with Creekside Manor that was developed actually by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12335)|
| 3:25:43| Hardin Valley Land Partners, but homes built by Ball Homes. Those issues there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12343)|
| 3:25:49| they've had, the counties had to be involved with several sloped areas, and they've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12349)|
| 3:25:53| major trouble already with the way Ball Homes finished out those lots after being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12353)|
| 3:25:59| developed by Hardin Valley Land Partners. So we're very concerned about the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12359)|
| 3:26:03| impact. Road issues, I'd just say the roundabout, we think it's great that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12363)|
| 3:26:07| are working with the county on making the roundabout available. We are curious if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12367)|
| 3:26:13| it's going to be large enough to handle the traffic, and are there going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12373)|
| 3:26:17| designated turn lanes there? We're also curious about Road A, as it would enter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12377)|
| 3:26:22| Hardin Valley Road, is it going to be right turn only, leaving that subdivision, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12382)|
| 3:26:27| how that will be handled? And then lastly, the historical preservation, the beautiful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12387)|
| 3:26:31| historic barn that's been there maybe since the 1930s or 40s, we would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12391)|
| 3:26:36| that preserved. I think Ball Homes is open to working with the county to perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12396)|
| 3:26:41| disassemble and reassemble the barn, maybe in a smaller footprint and a smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12401)|
| 3:26:46| size, but the people in this area consider that a landmark, and it's a beautiful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12406)|
| 3:26:52| structure, and we'd like to see the developer work with Knox County to keep that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12412)|
| 3:26:57| there. It's a beautiful piece of old historic fixture here in this area, a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12417)|
| 3:27:03| history here. We think it should be preserved. So those are just a few things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12423)|
| 3:27:07| we're concerned about, and I know time is up. Yes, it is. Thank you, Mr. Hill. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12427)|
| 3:27:12| you. John and Christine McKay, are they... Mr. McKay has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12432)|
| 3:27:21| Okay. While the time has been expired, Ms. McKay, I'll give you another minute or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12441)|
| 3:27:28| if you want to wrap up and mention something that Mr. Hill has not already brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12448)|
| 3:27:33| up. I'm trying to get her to unmute. Ms. McKay, can you unmute? While we're waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12453)|
| 3:28:01| on Ms. McKay, Mr. Fulgham, if you want to go ahead and speak about the project and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12481)|
| 3:28:08| answer any comments that you'd like to have regarding what Mr. Hill had mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12488)|
| 3:28:14| Sure. I think it was Billy Fulgham, 10330 Hardin Valley Road. I'm the civil engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12494)|
| 3:28:22| on the project. I feel like we've done a good job of meeting with the Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12502)|
| 3:28:30| advocates and addressing things that they wanted to see. Some of the things they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12510)|
| 3:28:35| to see is like a boulevard entrance, which we added that in a second entrance, and an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12515)|
| 3:28:40| amenity at the front of the development, which we moved and added that at the front of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12520)|
| 3:28:45| development. There's a lot of comments about the reforestation. This is something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12525)|
| 3:28:53| Ball Homes is choosing to do that other areas or other developments aren't doing. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12533)|
| 3:28:59| a concept that I'd be glad to talk with anybody about. It's the design that I came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12539)|
| 3:29:06| I've worked with the EPA, the National Wildlife Federation. I've worked with three or four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12546)|
| 3:29:13| foresters, three or four geotechnical engineers, grading contractors, other civil engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12553)|
| 3:29:20| This design has been very well vetted through a lot of people who are really experts at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12560)|
| 3:29:29| any of this. I feel like it's a great solution to these cut slopes or fill slopes. It helps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12569)|
| 3:29:42| with the stormwater runoff. It helps with erosion control. It's an enhancement, I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12582)|
| 3:29:48| like, that is over and beyond what a lot of developments are experiencing. But other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12588)|
| 3:29:58| than that, I'd be glad to open it up for any questions. The historic preservation, I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12598)|
| 3:30:06| speak to that. I'll have to get with Ball Homes with that. I'm sure they'll be glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12606)|
| 3:30:09| to sit down and talk with the community again. I know there's been two or three meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12609)|
| 3:30:16| already. The downstream stormwater protection, that's on us to make sure that we do a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12616)|
| 3:30:22| design. It's on the contractor to make sure that they build it correctly. And that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12622)|
| 3:30:27| part of the detailed design that we'll be working with the county on to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12627)|
| 3:30:33| that gets done right. That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12633)|
| 3:30:37| Thank you, Mr. Folger. I just want to say that of the projects that we've had come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12637)|
| 3:30:43| recently, this is one of the better designed. And I want to applaud you all for doing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12643)|
| 3:30:49| great job on this one. Ms. Brooks, as McKay's, have you been able to contact them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12649)|
| 3:30:58| No, we have not been able to get her to unmute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12658)|
| 3:31:03| All right. Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12663)|
| 3:31:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to make a motion to approve the alternative design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12668)|
| 3:31:12| standards one through four based on the recommendations of the Knox County Department of Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12672)|
| 3:31:16| and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12676)|
| 3:31:18| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12678)|
| 3:31:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12681)|
| 3:31:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12683)|
| 3:31:26| Before we go to the vote, Ms. Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12686)|
| 3:31:30| Yes, I have a few questions for the developer. One, Mr. Folger, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12690)|
| 3:31:40| There's 25.8 acres of overage on the Hilltop Preservation Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12700)|
| 3:31:48| And I see that you are reforesting and adding some buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12708)|
| 3:31:52| Do you match that 25.8 acres with your reforestation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12712)|
| 3:32:00| No, we're putting back 22 acres of reforestation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12720)|
| 3:32:06| But we can't match it and also be able to develop it and have the homes there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12726)|
| 3:32:13| Okay, but you are, as far as that overage goes, you're putting in 20 extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12733)|
| 3:32:21| You're matching it by 20 acres. Did I understand you correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12741)|
| 3:32:26| Yes, ma'am. Well, once the development is completed, 22 of the acres of the development will be reforested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12746)|
| 3:32:36| Oh, so we don't really know how that compares to the 25.8 of overage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12756)|
| 3:32:44| Does that help me on this? I don't really quite understand that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12764)|
| 3:32:48| And I'm just trying to understand how good the reforestation meets the need to develop the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12768)|
| 3:33:00| Yeah, sure. So there's about 76 acres of this property within the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12780)|
| 3:33:11| So what staff does then is we run a slope analysis to determine what different slope categories are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12791)|
| 3:33:18| And then we determine how much recommended disturbance maximum would be permissible by the hillside plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12798)|
| 3:33:29| In this case, it was about 40.5 acres would be recommended for the maximum disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12809)|
| 3:33:38| Their proposal is to disturb about 66 acres of the hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12818)|
| 3:33:43| So that's where we're getting that difference where they're getting more than what we recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12823)|
| 3:33:53| I think it was about 17 acres of the hillside protection was going to be reforested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12833)|
| 3:34:02| And then another four acres outside of the hillside protection was going to be reforested, if I remember correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12842)|
| 3:34:12| All right. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12852)|
| 3:34:14| And then I have one more question, which is a silly question for Mr. Folger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12854)|
| 3:34:19| What the heck is a odor control building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12859)|
| 3:34:24| That is so West Knox Utility District has a 30 inch horse main.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12864)|
| 3:34:33| So it's a sanitary sewer horse main that's running down along the creek, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12873)|
| 3:34:41| And that odor control building helps control the odor that's in that 30 inch horse main.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12881)|
| 3:34:52| Is there a scent? Is there an odor that escapes from the building or is it fully contained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12892)|
| 3:34:59| There would be a scent if they didn't have the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12899)|
| 3:35:03| So the building is to keep the horse main from having a scent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12903)|
| 3:35:10| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12910)|
| 3:35:13| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12913)|
| 3:35:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12917)|
| 3:35:19| Commissioner Korbelik, I think they just need better marketing for the name of their building so that there's less confusion about odors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12919)|
| 3:35:27| I was concerned about this development because of the reforestation issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12927)|
| 3:35:32| And I definitely appreciate the comments regarding like not disturbing that soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12932)|
| 3:35:38| But I think that's why the protections are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12938)|
| 3:35:42| However, we received an email from Kim Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12942)|
| 3:35:46| This was this morning about 756 that did provide some additional information about that reforestation effort that gave greater detail to not only what was going to be there, but also the different agencies that had been part of that process or were supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12946)|
| 3:36:03| That gave me a great greater level of confidence with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12963)|
| 3:36:07| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12967)|
| 3:36:09| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12969)|
| 3:36:11| That's what I was going to say also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12971)|
| 3:36:14| Echoing Commissioner Adams, I think that I'm usually pretty concerned about the percentage of disturbed in the hillside and steep slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12974)|
| 3:36:24| But I have greater confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12984)|
| 3:36:26| I appreciate that the developer is setting aside some of that not to be disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12986)|
| 3:36:30| And I really appreciate that they're making attempts to find the best way to reforest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12990)|
| 3:36:37| I think it's very difficult to ever reforest anything and have the same quality of the original forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=12997)|
| 3:36:43| But I'm curious to see how this attempt works out and appreciate the efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13003)|

| 3:41:15| And reduction of the 35 foot peripheral setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13275)|
| 3:41:19| 15 feet for lots one, 50, and 170.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13279)|
| 3:41:24| And 25 feet for lots 17, 18, 133, and 134.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13284)|
| 3:41:30| Subject to conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13290)|
| 3:41:32| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13292)|
| 3:41:42| Applicant, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13302)|
| 3:41:47| Yes, Ryan Hickey, 1914 Pinnacle Point Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13307)|
| 3:41:52| We would like to request approval for staff recommendation with a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13312)|
| 3:41:57| We'd like to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13317)|
| 3:42:00| Mr. Hickey, could you wait a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13320)|
| 3:42:02| Mr. Hickey, could you wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13322)|
| 3:42:03| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13323)|
| 3:42:07| Hearing no opposition, Mr. Hickey, proceed please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13327)|
| 3:42:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13331)|
| 3:42:13| On condition number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13333)|
| 3:42:14| it says providing a minimum 30 foot driveway depth for all driveways that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13334)|
| 3:42:18| connect to Road A or Old Andy's Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13338)|
| 3:42:23| We're fine with 30 foot driveway depth along Old Andy's Road because that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13343)|
| 3:42:27| road is not designed for on-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13347)|
| 3:42:30| I guess I have a question for staff on why they're asking for that on Road A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13350)|
| 3:42:39| Mr. Reynolds, would you like to address Mr. Hickey's request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13359)|
| 3:42:43| Yeah, I'll start off with the comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13363)|
| 3:42:46| and if engineering wants to do anything they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13366)|
| 3:42:50| But on some of these entry roads coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13370)|
| 3:42:54| we have quite a few houses that have to go through one point of entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13374)|
| 3:43:01| And then there's potentially another extension of this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13381)|
| 3:43:04| to add more cars to this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13384)|
| 3:43:07| I get a little bit concerned with the number of cars that might be parked in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13387)|
| 3:43:11| those high traffic roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13391)|
| 3:43:14| And then also with the reduced radius of that first curve in Road A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13394)|
| 3:43:19| that's a 175 foot radius, our typical is 250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13399)|
| 3:43:23| And I just, when you have cars parked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13403)|
| 3:43:27| especially on the inside of that turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13407)|
| 3:43:29| which is potentially you're starting to lose visibility around that turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13409)|
| 3:43:32| you're having to drive around cars and there's pedestrians there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13412)|
| 3:43:35| There's no sidewalks in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13415)|
| 3:43:37| It just complicates things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13417)|
| 3:43:39| So the more that we can try to get cars off the street on Road A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13419)|
| 3:43:42| I think the safer that road is going to be for both the pedestrians that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13422)|
| 3:43:45| use it and for vehicles that have to just drive around other vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13425)|
| 3:43:49| parked on the street and, you know, other oncoming cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13429)|
| 3:43:52| So that's something I'm concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13432)|
| 3:43:54| Mr. Hickey, any other comments you'd like to make before we go to open up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13434)|
| 3:43:57| the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13437)|
| 3:43:58| Unmute please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13438)|
| 3:44:12| before we go to open up to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13452)|
| 3:44:19| Unmute please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13459)|
| 3:44:24| Yes, if you look at the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13464)|
| 3:44:27| the inside radius on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13467)|
| 3:44:29| our engineer has put a site distant easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13469)|
| 3:44:32| across the front of those lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13472)|
| 3:44:34| to handle the issue with site distance in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13474)|
| 3:44:39| Okay, so the other lots on road A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13479)|
| 3:44:42| we would like to request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13482)|
| 3:44:44| they would meet the Knox County zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13484)|
| 3:44:47| which requires 20 foot front building setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13487)|
| 3:44:57| Any other comments you'd like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13497)|
| 3:45:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13503)|
| 3:45:04| Okay, thank you, Mr. Hickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13504)|
| 3:45:06| Okay, no opposition, so I'll open it up to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13506)|
| 3:45:11| Commissioner Roth, you were first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13511)|
| 3:45:14| Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13514)|
| 3:45:18| I think, I really think we ought to stick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13518)|
| 3:45:19| with what the engineering recommends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13519)|
| 3:45:22| Based on all that, I'd want to make a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13522)|
| 3:45:25| make a motion that we approve variances one and two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13525)|
| 3:45:27| and alternative design standards one through six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13527)|
| 3:45:31| based on recommendations of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13531)|
| 3:45:33| Department of Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13533)|
| 3:45:35| and because the site conditions restrict compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13535)|
| 3:45:38| with the subdivision regulations and the proposed variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13538)|
| 3:45:41| and alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13541)|
| 3:45:43| will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13543)|
| 3:45:45| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13545)|
| 3:45:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13546)|
| 3:45:48| Who seconded it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13548)|
| 3:45:50| Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13550)|
| 3:45:52| Thank you, Mr. Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13552)|
| 3:45:55| Still have some commissioners with their hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13555)|
| 3:45:57| Commissioner Eason, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13557)|
| 3:46:01| On this project, I also wanted to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13561)|
| 3:46:03| that I appreciate the developer and the engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13563)|
| 3:46:06| working to set aside some areas of no disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13566)|
| 3:46:08| and then to put in some reforestation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13568)|
| 3:46:12| of some of the areas on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13572)|
| 3:46:15| and from looking at the aerial of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13575)|
| 3:46:18| it looks like there are very little trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13578)|
| 3:46:20| on the existing site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13580)|
| 3:46:21| There's some trees, but it's not heavily forested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13581)|
| 3:46:24| so this could end up being an improvement overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13584)|
| 3:46:26| so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13586)|
| 3:46:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13589)|
| 3:46:30| Commissioner Corbelett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13590)|
| 3:46:32| Yes, a question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13592)|
| 3:46:36| You indicate there's a 7.94 acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13596)|
| 3:46:40| common area amenity area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13600)|
| 3:46:43| Could you describe that for me, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13603)|
| 3:46:48| Yes, we intend for that to be left open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13608)|
| 3:46:54| that students or children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13614)|
| 3:46:58| they can hike in there or do something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13618)|
| 3:47:01| and that area will have pedestrian access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13621)|
| 3:47:08| And where would that pedestrian access be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13628)|
| 3:47:13| I believe Billy Fulgerman, he can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13633)|
| 3:47:16| I believe he's gonna put it in between lots 36 and 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13636)|
| 3:47:22| All right, and you said it's gonna be open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13642)|
| 3:47:26| and amenable for hiking and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13646)|
| 3:47:29| so I haven't been out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13649)|
| 3:47:32| but we have a real problem with undergrowth and poison ivy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13652)|
| 3:47:37| Will you be making it possible to hike through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13657)|
| 3:47:45| I would think so, but I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13665)|
| 3:47:48| there is a possibility vegetation does grow in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13668)|
| 3:47:50| I mean, we want it to be vegetated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13670)|
| 3:47:54| to deal with erosion issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13674)|
| 3:47:57| No, I not understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13677)|
| 3:47:59| but you said the hiking, are you putting in a trail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13679)|
| 3:48:03| I mean, how, I'm just trying to imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13683)|
| 3:48:05| envision what you're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13685)|
| 3:48:12| I mean, it's just gonna be a green open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13692)|
| 3:48:15| So it will be grass and trees or bushes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13695)|
| 3:48:20| Grass and trees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13700)|
| 3:48:23| Yeah, grass, trees and whatever other vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13703)|
| 3:48:26| will naturally grow there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13706)|
| 3:48:29| Okay, well, you can understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13709)|
| 3:48:31| I don't mean to hammer on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13711)|
| 3:48:33| but does it do, I have an acre of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13713)|
| 3:48:36| in the back two thirds you can't even walk through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13716)|
| 3:48:39| because it's so overgrown with plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13719)|
| 3:48:42| And I was hoping that this could actually be an amenity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13722)|
| 3:48:46| for the residents, but it would have to be usable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13726)|
| 3:48:49| And that's why I was asking you these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13729)|
| 3:48:51| I hope you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13731)|
| 3:48:53| I'm just trying to figure out what the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13733)|
| 3:48:55| are going to have at the end of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13735)|
| 3:49:00| that they can use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13740)|
| 3:49:02| because at some point it becomes a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13742)|
| 3:49:04| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13744)|
| 3:49:07| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13747)|
| 3:49:10| Yes, I wanted just to sort of echo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13750)|
| 3:49:12| what Commissioner Eason said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=13752)|

| 3:55:18| and here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14118)|
| 3:55:21| Hired on behalf of Kirkland Financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14121)|
| 3:55:23| and Scott Davis as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14123)|

| 3:55:33| Do you not hear him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14133)|
| 3:55:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14137)|
| 3:55:37| I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14137)|
| 3:55:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14138)|
| 3:55:39| So I'll defer to Mr. Davis at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14139)|
| 3:55:43| I appreciate all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14143)|
| 3:55:44| Y'all may or may not be aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14144)|
| 3:55:45| This subdivision was started by a company called Vertex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14145)|
| 3:55:50| and it was funded by Kirkland Financial out of Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14150)|
| 3:55:54| Kirkland had to take over the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14154)|
| 3:55:56| The roads are already paved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14156)|
| 3:55:59| infrastructure's all in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14159)|
| 3:56:00| This is due a minor correction to the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14160)|
| 3:56:04| and so we just respectfully request y'all's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14164)|
| 3:56:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14169)|
| 3:56:11| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14171)|
| 3:56:13| Yes, I'm just curious about why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14173)|
| 3:56:16| the sidewalk would be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14176)|
| 3:56:18| My understanding is this is phase one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14178)|
| 3:56:19| of a much larger development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14179)|
| 3:56:21| and so wouldn't the phase one be kind of setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14181)|
| 3:56:24| that expectation so that the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14184)|
| 3:56:26| would be more important in phase one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14186)|
| 3:56:28| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14188)|
| 3:56:31| This may have initially been considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14191)|
| 3:56:33| as a larger development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14193)|
| 3:56:34| That's not how it ended up being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14194)|
| 3:56:37| It's a maximum of 54 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14197)|
| 3:56:40| I think that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14200)|
| 3:56:41| 54 or 55 lots and there's no additional lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14201)|
| 3:56:44| that will be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14204)|
| 3:56:45| All the land surrounding the property is already developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14205)|
| 3:56:49| and there's no sidewalks in the subdivisions on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14209)|
| 3:56:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14214)|
| 3:56:55| Thank you, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14215)|
| 3:56:56| Commissioner Korbelick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14216)|
| 3:56:59| Yes, I was confused about the sidewalk as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14219)|
| 3:57:04| Is the sidewalk removal just for the connecting road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14224)|
| 3:57:12| that isn't going in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14232)|
| 3:57:14| Or is the sidewalk removal along the main street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14234)|
| 3:57:20| The sidewalk removal is along the main road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14240)|
| 3:57:23| We will fix and we'll be providing a turn lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14243)|
| 3:57:28| coming off of Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14248)|
| 3:57:30| and very similar to the subdivision to the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14250)|
| 3:57:35| and I think the subdivision to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14255)|
| 3:57:38| And again, all we've been asked to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14258)|
| 3:57:39| with Kirkland Financial is just help them finish the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14259)|
| 3:57:44| and get it all cleaned up and on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14264)|
| 3:57:48| Here's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14268)|
| 3:57:50| The road is straight and a little hilly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14270)|
| 3:57:54| but quite straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14274)|
| 3:57:56| And I'm afraid we will end up in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14276)|
| 3:57:59| where the shallow driveways will make the cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14279)|
| 3:58:04| park on the street and then we're going to have a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14284)|
| 3:58:08| with no sidewalks, children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14288)|
| 3:58:10| and because the street is so linear, fast moving cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14290)|
| 3:58:16| I just see this as being a real safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14296)|
| 3:58:20| Are you able to extend the driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14300)|
| 3:58:23| so that it's 30 feet long instead of 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14303)|
| 3:58:27| to allow cars to park on the driveway comfortably?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14307)|
| 3:58:30| No ma'am, with the depth of the lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14310)|
| 3:58:32| as it's already developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14312)|
| 3:58:33| remember this is already developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14313)|
| 3:58:35| With the depth of the lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14315)|
| 3:58:37| and in respect to the sinkhole areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14317)|
| 3:58:42| that's not physically possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14322)|
| 3:58:45| Yes, I know the infrastructure's in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14325)|
| 3:58:47| so I'm definitely not comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14327)|
| 3:58:49| with allowing the sidewalk to not be installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14329)|
| 3:58:54| We have seen this problem over and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14334)|
| 3:58:57| with cars parked along the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14337)|
| 3:59:00| and with the straight street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14340)|
| 3:59:02| and the possibility of fast moving cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14342)|
| 3:59:05| I think it's going to be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14345)|
| 3:59:11| Thank you, Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14351)|
| 3:59:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14355)|

| 4:04:57| during this use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14697)|
| 4:05:00| My property is located west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14700)|
| 4:05:03| of the Westland Creek subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14703)|
| 4:05:05| We share common property lines back to back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14705)|
| 4:05:09| Due to the extreme hillside and topographic constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14709)|
| 4:05:15| in the new subdivision and the vast amount of regrading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14715)|
| 4:05:19| my property is also located approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14719)|
| 4:05:22| 20 to 25 feet below the new subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14722)|
| 4:05:27| A small swale separates my property from new lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14727)|
| 4:05:31| this swale being on the new lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14731)|
| 4:05:35| A 10 foot wall on my property, existing wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14735)|
| 4:05:39| also separates my property from the new lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14739)|
| 4:05:42| This has been placed since our house was constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14742)|
| 4:05:45| about 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14745)|
| 4:05:49| Approximately a three-on-one slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14749)|
| 4:05:52| is also at the back of the new lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14752)|
| 4:05:56| to reach the 20 to 25 foot elevation difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14756)|
| 4:06:00| between my property and the new lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14760)|
| 4:06:05| Referring to the subdivision plan sheet C-13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14765)|
| 4:06:10| runoff from the south ridge of the new subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14770)|
| 4:06:13| is being intercepted at headwall 42| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14773)|
| 4:06:16| and being rerouted to discharge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14776)|
| 4:06:18| in the two foot deep swale adjacent to our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14778)|
| 4:06:21| The swale also collects surface runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14781)|
| 4:06:24| from the upgraded lots and is located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14784)|
| 4:06:27| at the extreme back property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14787)|
| 4:06:28| of the Westland Creek subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14788)|
| 4:06:31| It is approximately 20 feet above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14791)|
| 4:06:34| our property main floor elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14794)|
| 4:06:37| And just for a mental picture, from my back porch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14797)|
| 4:06:42| we hope that the stormwater runoff from the two foot swale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14802)|
| 4:06:45| does not overtop and flood the property that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14805)|
| 4:06:49| This is a waterfall that we do not want to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14809)|
| 4:06:53| I have several concerns and I'm requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14813)|
| 4:06:55| that the commissioners delay any modifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14815)|
| 4:06:58| to the subdivision plan until the following concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14818)|
| 4:07:02| have been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14822)|
| 4:07:04| I am concerned that the swale is not adequately sized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14824)|
| 4:07:08| I am concerned that our existing wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14828)|
| 4:07:10| for which our top of wall appears to be located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14830)|
| 4:07:13| approximately five to 10 feet below the new swale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14833)|
| 4:07:17| could be overtopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14837)|
| 4:07:19| I'm concerned that existing and new owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14839)|
| 4:07:22| are not being prevented from making any changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14842)|
| 4:07:25| to the swale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14845)|
| 4:07:27| I'm also concerned that no measures have been taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14847)|
| 4:07:30| to prevent future residents from placing temporary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14850)|
| 4:07:33| or accessory structures, such as landscape boxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14853)|
| 4:07:37| sandboxes, or other temporary yard features in the swale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14857)|
| 4:07:41| that could modify it, that could impact stormwater flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14861)|
| 4:07:45| I'm concerned that no easement has been established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14865)|
| 4:07:47| to protect the swale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14867)|
| 4:07:49| And I'm concerned for the potential of even seepage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14869)|
| 4:07:54| flowing from our home into our home and on our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14874)|
| 4:07:58| due to the abrupt elevation changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14878)|
| 4:08:00| from the new property to ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14880)|
| 4:08:03| I expressed these concerns to the county representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14883)|
| 4:08:07| on July 29th, and they have not had the chance to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14887)|
| 4:08:14| I would like to know the following,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14894)|
| 4:08:16| is the swale adequately sized for the existing lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14896)|
| 4:08:21| as well as for the future development shown on sheet C5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14901)|
| 4:08:26| If the swale is proven to not be adequate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14906)|
| 4:08:30| or should an owner modify the swale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14910)|
| 4:08:34| what is our recourse in the event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14914)|
| 4:08:36| that our property is impacted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14916)|
| 4:08:39| Does the stormwater runoff plan for the new subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14919)|
| 4:08:42| specifically prevent new owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14922)|
| 4:08:44| from adding man-made structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14924)|
| 4:08:45| temporary features, or apartments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14925)|
| 4:08:48| Does the stormwater runoff plan for the new subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14928)|
| 4:08:51| specifically prevent new owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14931)|
| 4:08:52| from making swale elevation changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14932)|
| 4:08:56| Who enforces the regulations to prevent future buyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14936)|
| 4:09:00| from adversely impacting the drainage path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14940)|
| 4:09:03| to prevent ponding and to prevent buyers or owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14943)|
| 4:09:07| from modifying the swale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14947)|
| 4:09:10| And how does the stormwater management plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14950)|
| 4:09:13| take into consideration the future development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14953)|
| 4:09:16| as shown on page C5, or sheet C5 of the plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14956)|
| 4:09:20| Runoff from this future development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14960)|
| 4:09:22| is also routed through the swale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14962)|
| 4:09:24| I think there's a swale all the way down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14964)|
| 4:09:27| Thank you for your time during this review period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14967)|
| 4:09:29| I request that the commission place a hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14969)|
| 4:09:32| on these modifications, and I hope that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14972)|
| 4:09:35| can be allowed for the developer to address my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14975)|
| 4:09:39| Thank you, Mr. Mayfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14979)|
| 4:09:40| Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14980)|
| 4:09:42| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14982)|
| 4:09:43| And thank you, Mr. Mayfield, for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14983)|
| 4:09:47| As the commission is aware, this is a revision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14987)|
| 4:09:52| from a similar concept plan that was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14992)|
| 4:09:55| earlier this year in April of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14995)|
| 4:09:59| The stormwater drainage and plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=14999)|
| 4:10:02| that Mr. Mayfield is discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15002)|
| 4:10:07| has already been constructed and approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15007)|
| 4:10:11| by Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15011)|
| 4:10:13| Our engineers have worked with Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15013)|
| 4:10:16| on the sizing of the swales and the drainage plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15016)|
| 4:10:21| for the subdivision, and they have determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15021)|
| 4:10:25| that it meets or exceeds the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15025)|
| 4:10:27| Knox County stormwater regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15027)|
| 4:10:30| So I understand Mr. Mayfield's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15030)|
| 4:10:34| However, engineering has already approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15034)|
| 4:10:38| these plans for the drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15038)|
| 4:10:42| What we are doing essentially here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15042)|
| 4:10:45| is we are reducing the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15045)|
| 4:10:49| It will allow us from 50 feet to 40 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15049)|
| 4:10:52| to allow us to add sidewalks on some of the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15052)|
| 4:10:58| and to improve the backyard access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15058)|
| 4:11:01| and make them better yards and places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15061)|
| 4:11:05| It's approved for five to one units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15065)|
| 4:11:07| It's actually going to be built out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15067)|
| 4:11:08| of approximately 3.2 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15068)|
| 4:11:12| There will be one additional lot added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15072)|
| 4:11:15| to this concept plan from the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15075)|
| 4:11:17| that was approved in April of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15077)|
| 4:11:21| Respectfully, I would assert that this meets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15081)|
| 4:11:24| the requirements subject to the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15084)|
| 4:11:27| and the variances which are necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15087)|
| 4:11:30| because of the topography that Mr. Mayfield mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15090)|
| 4:11:34| and that I would ask the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15094)|
| 4:11:35| to approve this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15095)|
| 4:11:38| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15098)|
| 4:11:40| Commissioner Korbelek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15100)|
| 4:11:43| Yes, I have a question for staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15103)|
| 4:11:47| which is regarding condition nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15107)|
| 4:11:51| It refers to right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15111)|
| 4:11:54| so the rows A and B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15114)|
| 4:11:56| that the right-of-way be wide enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15116)|
| 4:11:59| to creation of one or two lots to access them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15119)|
| 4:12:02| I was wondering if the staff could explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15122)|
| 4:12:04| that condition to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15124)|
| 4:12:07| It was just to be able to connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15127)|
| 4:12:10| to future development that may occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15130)|
| 4:12:15| Lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15135)|
| 4:12:16| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15136)|
| 4:12:18| On the adjoining lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15138)|
| 4:12:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15139)|
| 4:12:22| Do you want to limit it then to one or two lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15142)|
| 4:12:24| Do you want to just have a connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15144)|
| 4:12:27| and then the future applicants can take it from there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15147)|
| 4:12:31| I mean, on the adjoining lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15151)|
| 4:12:35| I think it was just meaning to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15155)|
| 4:12:36| well, on either side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15156)|
| 4:12:37| is kind of what that was referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15157)|
| 4:12:40| but if you would like to amend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15160)|
| 4:12:42| then you can do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15162)|
| 4:12:46| Yeah, I think it just might be unduly restrictive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15166)|
| 4:12:48| since we don't know what the adjoining lots will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15168)|
| 4:12:51| the adjoining properties will develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15171)|
| 4:12:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15173)|
| 4:12:57| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15177)|
| 4:13:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15182)|
| 4:13:03| I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15183)|
| 4:13:04| We approve variance one and alternate design standard one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15184)|
| 4:13:07| because topographic constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15187)|
| 4:13:10| and the site conditions restrict compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15190)|
| 4:13:12| with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15192)|
| 4:13:14| and the proposed variance will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15194)|
| 4:13:18| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15198)|
| 4:13:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15201)|
| 4:13:25| Commissioner Adams, you have a comment, please, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15205)|
| 4:13:28| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15208)|
| 4:13:29| A quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15209)|
| 4:13:31| So Mr. Mayfield, some of his concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15211)|
| 4:13:34| seem to be just about making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15214)|
| 4:13:36| that the future residents would have some guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15216)|
| 4:13:39| to follow so that they would understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15219)|
| 4:13:41| how some of the actions they might take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15221)|
| 4:13:44| could impact his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15224)|
| 4:13:46| Is that something Mr. Mullins can speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15226)|
| 4:13:48| or did I miss that being addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15228)|
| 4:13:53| I haven't spoken to that yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15233)|
| 4:13:55| but I'd be glad to answer your question, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15235)|
| 4:13:57| I mean, there are covenants and restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15237)|
| 4:14:00| that will be in place that will restrict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15240)|
| 4:14:03| any of those type of activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15243)|

| 4:20:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15626)|
| 4:20:27| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15627)|
| 4:20:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15634)|
| 4:20:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15634)|
| 4:20:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15636)|
| 4:20:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15636)|
| 4:20:40| Just one second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15640)|
| 4:20:43| We got signed up Mr. Bradley, Ms. King, and Ms. Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15643)|
| 4:20:49| Are they all three here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15649)|
| 4:20:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15653)|
| 4:20:55| Mr. Mullins, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15655)|
| 4:20:57| Would you like the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15657)|
| 4:20:59| I'd like to say something to start briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15659)|
| 4:21:02| and then reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15662)|
| 4:21:05| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15665)|
| 4:21:08| I appreciate your time, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15668)|
| 4:21:11| I know you all have received quite a bit of correspondence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15671)|
| 4:21:14| over the past few days on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15674)|
| 4:21:17| I hope you've read them intently and carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15677)|
| 4:21:20| I know I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15680)|
| 4:21:22| I also hope that you received the two written correspondence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15682)|
| 4:21:26| I sent in today framing some of these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15686)|
| 4:21:29| and also discussing some fencing alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15689)|
| 4:21:33| that we are willing to consider in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15693)|
| 4:21:37| This has been a long search for Acadia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15697)|
| 4:21:39| and trying to find the right piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15699)|
| 4:21:42| despite the opposition from the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15702)|
| 4:21:44| And we understand where their opposition is founded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15704)|
| 4:21:47| But despite that, we believe this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15707)|
| 4:21:50| is an appropriate piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15710)|
| 4:21:52| It's the appropriate zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15712)|
| 4:21:53| It is consistent with the other development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15713)|
| 4:21:56| in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15716)|
| 4:21:57| And we'd ask that you would follow staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15717)|
| 4:22:00| and approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15720)|
| 4:22:01| I think the best use of my time, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15721)|
| 4:22:04| is let the opposition go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15724)|
| 4:22:06| Let's hear what their concerns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15726)|
| 4:22:08| And then I'm sure there'll be specific questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15728)|
| 4:22:11| and that we can address as we move through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15731)|
| 4:22:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15734)|
| 4:22:15| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15735)|
| 4:22:16| You have almost four minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15736)|
| 4:22:17| Can you guys introduce both of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15737)|
| 4:22:20| We've got Ms. King and Ms. Howard and Mr. Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15740)|
| 4:22:24| Are you available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15744)|
| 4:22:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15746)|
| 4:22:27| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15747)|
| 4:22:28| Mr. Bradley gave his time to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15748)|
| 4:22:32| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15752)|
| 4:22:33| If there's two of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15753)|
| 4:22:35| you need to reconsider and split the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15755)|
| 4:22:38| Need your name and an address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15758)|
| 4:22:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15761)|
| 4:22:41| My name is Megan Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15761)|
| 4:22:42| I'm at 4921 Wise Springs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15762)|
| 4:22:45| And sitting next to me is Kathy King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15765)|
| 4:22:48| I'm at 4915 Wise Springs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15768)|
| 4:22:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15772)|
| 4:22:53| Okay, so before our time starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15773)|
| 4:22:55| we just want to make sure that the PowerPoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15775)|
| 4:22:58| had been available to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15778)|
| 4:23:01| that everyone had an opportunity to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15781)|
| 4:23:04| Let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15784)|
| 4:23:05| Was that emailed to the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15785)|
| 4:23:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15788)|
| 4:23:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15789)|
| 4:23:10| Yeah, it is not up on the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15790)|
| 4:23:11| so just proceed with your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15791)|
| 4:23:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15795)|
| 4:23:16| So we want to acknowledge the time that you've given us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15796)|
| 4:23:18| Also want to acknowledge the time that Acadia gave to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15798)|
| 4:23:23| We met as a community on August 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15803)|
| 4:23:25| Acadia did give us the 10th and the 11th to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15805)|
| 4:23:29| On the 13th, we're presenting to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15809)|
| 4:23:32| which is kind of crazy for those of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15812)|
| 4:23:34| who are not able or used to this type of setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15814)|
| 4:23:39| We were overwhelmed with the turnout that came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15819)|
| 4:23:41| We are a little bit disheartened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15821)|
| 4:23:43| that now that we have gotten into things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15823)|
| 4:23:45| there are several people that aren't going to be able to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15825)|
| 4:23:47| what they want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15827)|
| 4:23:48| So we are requesting, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15828)|
| 4:23:52| possibly a postponement or delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15832)|
| 4:23:54| so that the community can digest what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15834)|
| 4:23:59| Also a concern is in the definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15839)|
| 4:24:01| or is the definition of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15841)|
| 4:24:04| for assisted living, which is what this was requested under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15844)|
| 4:24:07| is that antiquated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15847)|
| 4:24:09| Because we do have assisted living under 6.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15849)|
| 4:24:12| We have a recovery home as 4.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15852)|
| 4:24:15| We have several community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15855)|
| 4:24:16| that assume this was assisted living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15856)|
| 4:24:18| based on those criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15858)|
| 4:24:22| Also, the biggest thing for us as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15862)|
| 4:24:26| is that this is not a box for us to check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15866)|
| 4:24:29| on traffic impact or school impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15869)|
| 4:24:33| There really is a community concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15873)|
| 4:24:37| about a company that has not accepted responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15877)|
| 4:24:43| for their previous facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15883)|
| 4:24:45| They have not presented themselves as a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15885)|
| 4:24:48| We have talked to them at length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15888)|
| 4:24:53| You know, we're not comparing apples to oranges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15893)|
| 4:24:55| with the previous facility to this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15895)|
| 4:24:58| However, they have been in charge of both of those facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15898)|
| 4:25:03| and have not publicly acknowledged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15903)|
| 4:25:05| or to us as a community acknowledged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15905)|
| 4:25:07| their shortcomings with that security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15907)|
| 4:25:10| We have requested as a community a perimeter fencing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15910)|
| 4:25:15| and I am hearing that just now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15915)|
| 4:25:17| for the first time that Mr. Mullins is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15917)|
| 4:25:20| that they are talking about alternative fencing options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15920)|
| 4:25:23| that is not something that we have known about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15923)|
| 4:25:27| We would like to discuss that further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15927)|
| 4:25:31| It was met with much resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15931)|
| 4:25:35| We also have a couple questions as far as the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15935)|
| 4:25:39| In the event of a fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15939)|
| 4:25:40| we were told that only doors would open to the courtyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15940)|
| 4:25:43| We have learned that that may not be code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15943)|
| 4:25:47| that all doors may open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15947)|
| 4:25:48| We do have a question for Ben as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15948)|
| 4:25:51| who the contact person of the detention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15951)|
| 4:25:54| and the sheriff's department is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15954)|
| 4:25:56| At this point, we're not finding that there is any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15956)|
| 4:26:00| and Kathy is gonna take over from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15960)|
| 4:26:03| Yes, I just wanna bring up basically that my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15963)|

| 4:26:20| and chemical dependencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15980)|
| 4:26:22| And most of these people actually will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15982)|
| 4:26:25| usually multiple diagnosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15985)|
| 4:26:26| Review the literature indicates that the environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15986)|
| 4:26:29| for these patients will need a stable, serene, safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15989)|
| 4:26:32| and nurturing environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15992)|
| 4:26:33| Speaking as an active working registered nurse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15993)|
| 4:26:36| with 40 years experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15996)|
| 4:26:38| continuous gunfire that can be all day long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=15998)|
| 4:26:40| sometimes six days a week does not promote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16000)|
| 4:26:43| a sense of safety, serene, or nurturing environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16003)|
| 4:26:45| The environment of the proposed treatment center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16005)|
| 4:26:47| is not conducive to meeting a therapeutic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16007)|
| 4:26:50| nurturing, or healing environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16010)|
| 4:26:52| for residential treatment patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16012)|
| 4:26:54| At the meeting, the actual Arcadia medical representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16014)|
| 4:26:58| was not aware that there was a firing range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16018)|
| 4:27:01| located next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16021)|
| 4:27:02| I actually have something I want to play for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16022)|
| 4:27:10| Basically, this was taken on my back porch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16030)|
| 4:27:21| Conformity of the proposal criteria established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16041)|
| 4:27:24| by Knox County zoning indicates that no surrounding land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16044)|
| 4:27:28| will pose a hazard or create an unsuitable environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16048)|
| 4:27:32| for the proposed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16052)|
| 4:27:34| The other thing I want to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16054)|
| 4:27:35| is Arcadia states patient first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16055)|
| 4:27:37| and I have concerns about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16057)|
| 4:27:40| which includes the safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16060)|
| 4:27:41| Our community needs to be first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16061)|
| 4:27:44| They do not feel that because of the village| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16064)|
| 4:27:48| and everything else they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16068)|
| 4:27:50| and with the incidents there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16070)|
| 4:27:52| the neighbors are very concerned about the young children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16072)|
| 4:27:55| and the adolescents, the disabled, and the elderly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16075)|
| 4:27:58| that some of their children are often home alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16078)|
| 4:28:02| after school hours, and the elderly at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16082)|
| 4:28:05| and this will be additional emotional stress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16085)|
| 4:28:07| or financial burden that they have to find after care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16087)|
| 4:28:10| So perimeter fencing is a necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16090)|
| 4:28:15| and we want to stay in conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16095)|
| 4:28:19| that landscape does not create a barrier for a full privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16099)|
| 4:28:24| And it's not impenetrable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16104)|
| 4:28:27| Mr. Mullins, you have three minutes and 56 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16107)|
| 4:28:32| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16112)|
| 4:28:34| I want to address some of the points that they raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16114)|
| 4:28:38| The design of this facility is taking into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16118)|
| 4:28:42| not only our past experiences with the village,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16122)|
| 4:28:45| but also our past experiences throughout the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16125)|
| 4:28:48| both positive and negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16128)|
| 4:28:50| to create a state-of-the-art campus type facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16130)|
| 4:28:54| which doesn't exist in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16134)|
| 4:28:55| It certainly doesn't exist at the village,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16135)|
| 4:28:57| which is more of a campground style activity with cabins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16137)|
| 4:29:02| which do not have locked doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16142)|
| 4:29:04| And you can lock them from people coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16144)|
| 4:29:06| from the outside, but you can't lock them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16146)|
| 4:29:08| to prevent people from going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16148)|
| 4:29:10| It is bisected by a subdivision neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16150)|
| 4:29:14| and there's actually no fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16154)|
| 4:29:16| around any part of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16156)|
| 4:29:18| So a lot of the problems that we have experienced there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16158)|
| 4:29:21| which Acadia inherited that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16161)|
| 4:29:23| we are specifically designed to avoid here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16163)|
| 4:29:27| with this concept, kind of a college campus cottage concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16167)|
| 4:29:33| The use being defined as assisted living facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16173)|
| 4:29:35| that was not the definition that I had applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16175)|
| 4:29:38| I go into more detail in the email that I sent today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16178)|
| 4:29:42| but I think Michelle talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16182)|
| 4:29:44| at the agenda review on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16184)|
| 4:29:47| Initially, Mr. Green, Mr. Nations, Mr. Payne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16187)|
| 4:29:52| and the fire marshal and the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16192)|
| 4:29:54| we all met talking about what zone would this fit in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16194)|
| 4:29:58| and they thought it was best described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16198)|
| 4:30:00| as a boarding home for sheltered care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16200)|
| 4:30:03| which then translates to the PR zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16203)|
| 4:30:06| as a daycare home or a group home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16206)|
| 4:30:09| And that was the concept there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16209)|
| 4:30:11| Regardless, the use on review standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16211)|
| 4:30:13| for assisted living facility and those other definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16213)|
| 4:30:16| that were previously interpreted by Knox County codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16216)|
| 4:30:20| are the same, and we meet or exceed those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16220)|
| 4:30:23| It doesn't change the stringent state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16223)|
| 4:30:25| and federal regulations that we have to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16225)|
| 4:30:28| as a behavioral treatment center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16228)|
| 4:30:32| The firing range, I talked to Mr. Hugh Holt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16232)|
| 4:30:34| he is the public relations liaison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16234)|
| 4:30:37| for the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16237)|
| 4:30:38| and I put all this in my email as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16238)|
| 4:30:41| They have both an indoor firing range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16241)|
| 4:30:42| and an outdoor training facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16242)|
| 4:30:44| That facilities, those facilities are open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16244)|
| 4:30:47| nine to four, Monday through Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16247)|
| 4:30:50| There are times where there is gunfire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16250)|
| 4:30:52| that's constant out in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16252)|
| 4:30:54| I would expect that from some neighbors from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16254)|
| 4:30:58| That is something that Acadia has considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16258)|
| 4:31:00| and is taking into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16260)|
| 4:31:03| The behavioral experts at Acadia do not see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16263)|
| 4:31:06| as being detrimental on a clinical standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16266)|
| 4:31:10| to this type of therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16270)|
| 4:31:14| Finding a piece of property like this is hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16274)|
| 4:31:16| It's hard to find a piece of property with enough acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16276)|
| 4:31:20| with access to roads so we can get our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16280)|
| 4:31:24| in and out safely, we can get the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16284)|
| 4:31:26| in and out safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16286)|
| 4:31:28| It also has access to public sewers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16288)|
| 4:31:30| That's what this property does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16290)|
| 4:31:32| The way it's situated with the detention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16292)|
| 4:31:36| to the north, we can cluster our development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16296)|
| 4:31:40| up in that area, which is flat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16300)|
| 4:31:41| and avoid the steeper hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16301)|
| 4:31:43| more rural areas to the south that we can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16303)|
| 4:31:46| for additional therapy opportunities once they arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16306)|
| 4:31:51| I went into detail in my email with the security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16311)|
| 4:31:53| I'd be glad to answer specific questions as to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16313)|
| 4:31:58| but with regards to the fencing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16318)|
| 4:31:59| after the meeting, we spoke to several of the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16319)|
| 4:32:02| that said if we aren't willing to consider perimeter fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16322)|
| 4:32:06| and we don't think that's necessary to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16326)|
| 4:32:09| and to the northwest where there's not a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16329)|
| 4:32:12| it's very dense forest and topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16332)|
| 4:32:16| there's not a lot of neighbors up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16336)|
| 4:32:19| would you consider a fence that basically shields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16339)|
| 4:32:23| and deters and prevents access to the adjoining neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16343)|
| 4:32:28| that are closest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16348)|
| 4:32:29| We are willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16349)|
| 4:32:30| We have put that plan before the commission today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16350)|
| 4:32:34| and we're willing for that to be a condition for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16354)|
| 4:32:38| I see that I'm out of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16358)|
| 4:32:39| but I would love to answer more questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16359)|
| 4:32:41| that I'm sure there's still a lot more to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16361)|
| 4:32:43| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16363)|
| 4:32:45| Turning over to commission now, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16365)|
| 4:32:48| I noticed your hand's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16368)|
| 4:32:50| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16370)|
| 4:32:52| I wanted to ask a couple of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16372)|
| 4:32:55| that were themes of the comments that we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16375)|
| 4:32:59| One of them is about when notification was made about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16379)|
| 4:33:05| This is, I guess, a question to staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16385)|
| 4:33:08| about where signs were placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16388)|
| 4:33:09| or when that notification was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16389)|
| 4:33:14| Sure, so we send out postcards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16394)|
| 4:33:16| within 200 feet of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16396)|
| 4:33:18| A lot of the comments that we're getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16398)|
| 4:33:20| are beyond the 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16400)|
| 4:33:21| We did post a sign, not exactly sure the exact date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16401)|
| 4:33:25| but it was approximately a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16405)|
| 4:33:27| And then we send out the sign, the postcard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16407)|
| 4:33:30| and then we post the notice in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16410)|
| 4:33:33| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16413)|
| 4:33:35| The other question I have is related sort of to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16415)|
| 4:33:40| because we're, I mean, while we've been in this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16420)|
| 4:33:43| we're continuing to get messages from people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16423)|
| 4:33:47| about this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16427)|
| 4:33:50| So it seems like there is continued people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16430)|
| 4:33:53| there are continued people just discovering it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16433)|
| 4:33:56| finding out about it, wanting to voice their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16436)|
| 4:33:58| And Ms. King and Ms. Howard were speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16438)|
| 4:34:02| to some of the fencing opportunities that were new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16442)|
| 4:34:05| They seemed open to some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16445)|
| 4:34:08| So it sounds like there is, things are still afoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16448)|
| 4:34:12| So I hope that there may be some ground of compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16452)|
| 4:34:15| that can be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16455)|
| 4:34:17| I am concerned about the gun firing range, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16457)|
| 4:34:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16460)|
| 4:34:21| Commissioner Kordeluk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16461)|
| 4:34:24| Yes, I have a question directed to staff first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16464)|
| 4:34:28| and then a short one to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16468)|
| 4:34:31| I'd like to have you explain your decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16471)|
| 4:34:35| to go with assisted living as your interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16475)|
| 4:34:39| as a proper category for this use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16479)|
| 4:34:43| rather than any other label.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16483)|
| 4:34:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16487)|
| 4:34:48| Sure, so when I was looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16488)|
| 4:34:51| the residential treatment facility as proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16491)|
| 4:34:53| didn't fit cleanly into one category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16493)|
| 4:34:57| So I reached out to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16497)|
| 4:34:59| since they administer their ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16499)|
| 4:35:00| it would be largely up to them how they would classify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16500)|
| 4:35:03| And so none of us knew that they had met previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16503)|
| 4:35:07| with those other folks that Ben mentioned earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16507)|
| 4:35:10| because none of those people work here anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16510)|
| 4:35:12| However, it was determined that the assisted living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16512)|
| 4:35:14| facility would be the best fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16514)|
| 4:35:16| I would defer to Steve Elliott in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16516)|
| 4:35:20| to speak to that further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16520)|
| 4:35:24| But as far as the boarding home for sheltered care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16524)|
| 4:35:27| it seems like that use hasn't been distributed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16527)|
| 4:35:29| within the zoning ordinance to any of the zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16529)|
| 4:35:31| It's not listed as a use at all in any of the zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16531)|
| 4:35:35| which might've been why they went with assisted living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16535)|
| 4:35:38| but he could speak to that in more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16538)|
| 4:35:42| Is he available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16542)|
| 4:35:47| Is anyone from county zoning on the call, on the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16547)|
| 4:35:54| Yes, Steve Elliott, 205 West Baxter Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16554)|
| 4:35:58| North of Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16558)|
| 4:36:01| As we go through the zoning ordinance, you're right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16561)|
| 4:36:04| this really doesn't fit anything in the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16564)|
| 4:36:07| but it fits best under assisted living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16567)|
| 4:36:10| is kind of our interpretation of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16570)|
| 4:36:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16577)|
| 4:36:19| Any other comments from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16579)|
| 4:36:21| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16581)|
| 4:36:23| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16583)|
| 4:36:26| Yeah, I was just asking about the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16586)|
| 4:36:29| because the assisted living has an age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16589)|
| 4:36:33| it has age requirements, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16593)|
| 4:36:38| So anyway, I think it says 85% of the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16598)|
| 4:36:45| needed to be over 55, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16605)|
| 4:36:49| But anyway, so that's the, but we feel good about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16609)|
| 4:36:56| about categorizing this as an assisted living?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16616)|
| 4:37:03| As for me, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16623)|
| 4:37:04| we don't typically make those kind of determinations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16624)|
| 4:37:07| as staff, how they're going to classify use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16627)|
| 4:37:10| But I will say that the recovery housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16630)|
| 4:37:11| if that has the closest fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16631)|
| 4:37:14| to how it's going to be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16634)|
| 4:37:16| their proposal does meet recovery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16636)|
| 4:37:19| the recovery housing stipulations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16639)|
| 4:37:22| It basically talks about the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16642)|
| 4:37:24| not being located within a certain proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16644)|
| 4:37:27| of another recovery housing facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16647)|
| 4:37:30| that it be within 1,320 feet of bus transit routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16650)|
| 4:37:35| Talks about the population to be served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16655)|
| 4:37:37| It talks about on or off-site treatment and special care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16657)|
| 4:37:40| It talks about facility operations and security measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16660)|
| 4:37:43| It doesn't provide a minimum threshold of security measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16663)|
| 4:37:46| It just says that they have to have security measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16666)|
| 4:37:49| So, you know, it's kind of difficult to deny something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16669)|
| 4:37:53| on an ordinance base that doesn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16673)|
| 4:37:55| any sort of minimum requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16675)|
| 4:37:56| for you to base that decision on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16676)|
| 4:38:00| I know that you guys have heard a lot about their security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16680)|
| 4:38:02| through the operation summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16682)|
| 4:38:04| and Ben kind of touched on those earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16684)|
| 4:38:06| The only thing they didn't have was the letter from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16686)|
| 4:38:10| but that can be done during the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16690)|
| 4:38:14| That would be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16694)|
| 4:38:17| Thank you, Ms. Porce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16697)|
| 4:38:19| Commissioner Oden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16699)|
| 4:38:21| Yeah, I know Ben sent in a letter earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16701)|
| 4:38:25| that said he didn't want to get postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16705)|
| 4:38:28| and I, you know, I hate getting postponed myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16708)|
| 4:38:32| when I'm trying to do deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16712)|
| 4:38:33| You never know how long it's taking somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16713)|
| 4:38:35| just to get to where they've gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16715)|
| 4:38:37| Ben's one of the most thorough people that I encounter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16717)|
| 4:38:41| coming across Planning Commission over my time here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16721)|
| 4:38:43| and he's very diligent in talking to folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16723)|
| 4:38:48| and, you know, this appears to be a decent site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16728)|
| 4:38:53| but it is a very large-scale development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16733)|
| 4:38:59| 216-something beds, I think is what was said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16739)|
| 4:39:02| and disturbing a lot of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16742)|
| 4:39:04| and, you know, getting out into a part of the county that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16744)|
| 4:39:11| you know, it just seems like there's a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16751)|
| 4:39:15| to talk about here on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16755)|
| 4:39:17| and I think that there's probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16757)|
| 4:39:21| because of the fencing and security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16761)|
| 4:39:23| and, you know, we're bantering back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16763)|
| 4:39:28| how to fit this round peg in a square hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16768)|
| 4:39:33| I just think there's some more discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16773)|
| 4:39:35| that's needed with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16775)|
| 4:39:37| and I know Ben can talk to about anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16777)|
| 4:39:43| and help bridge anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16783)|
| 4:39:46| Not suggesting I'm ready to vote for it at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16786)|
| 4:39:49| or I'll even vote for it after we postpone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16789)|
| 4:39:53| but I'm not ready to vote on it today, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16793)|
| 4:39:57| That's just my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16797)|
| 4:39:59| Commissioner, are you making a motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16799)|
| 4:40:03| I'd like to make a motion to postpone it for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16803)|
| 4:40:06| Chairman Phillips, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16806)|
| 4:40:08| Second from Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16808)|
| 4:40:12| Who seconded that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16812)|
| 4:40:14| Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16814)|
| 4:40:15| Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16815)|
| 4:40:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16817)|
| 4:40:20| Commissioner Roth, you had your hand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16820)|
| 4:40:22| and also Commissioner Korbelek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16822)|
| 4:40:24| So, Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16824)|

| 4:40:34| His hand's down, so Commissioner Korbelek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16834)|
| 4:40:39| Yeah, just a quick question to Mr. Mullins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16839)|
| 4:40:44| and that is that in your submittal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16844)|
| 4:40:46| you stated that this was a desirable area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16846)|
| 4:40:49| because of the low number of residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16849)|
| 4:40:53| Were you aware that apparently there's a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16853)|
| 4:40:56| for a single-family development across the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16856)|
| 4:41:02| I'm aware that Smithville owns several hundred acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16862)|
| 4:41:06| out across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16866)|
| 4:41:08| I am aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16868)|
| 4:41:09| Of course, whenever new development comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16869)|
| 4:41:13| they will be looking at the impacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16873)|
| 4:41:15| and I'm sure Smithville's already considered the impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16875)|
| 4:41:17| of its proximity to the detention facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16877)|
| 4:41:22| and they would also be looking at their impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16882)|
| 4:41:24| for our facility once it's approved and it goes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16884)|
| 4:41:28| I can tell you, I know Rocky Smith and Josh Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16888)|
| 4:41:33| I've done work for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16893)|
| 4:41:34| If they had concerns about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16894)|
| 4:41:36| they would be joining the voices that are in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16896)|
| 4:41:40| I was thinking the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16900)|
| 4:41:42| I didn't know if you needed to be away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16902)|
| 4:41:46| The concern with the neighbors, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16906)|
| 4:41:49| I mean, we understand that this type of use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16909)|
| 4:41:52| is something that draws attention to neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16912)|
| 4:41:55| and so when we're moving into an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16915)|
| 4:41:57| we do want to try to find an area that is rural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16917)|
| 4:42:00| an area that we can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16920)|
| 4:42:02| is more low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16922)|
| 4:42:04| You know, but at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16924)|
| 4:42:06| trying to strike that balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16926)|
| 4:42:07| between somewhere that is low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16927)|
| 4:42:10| So we do have minimum impact to the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16930)|
| 4:42:12| as we're moving in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16932)|
| 4:42:15| as well as the access to infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16935)|
| 4:42:18| particularly sewer, which is very difficult to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16938)|
| 4:42:20| in a lot of the areas that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16940)|
| 4:42:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16944)|
| 4:42:25| Thank you. Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16945)|
| 4:42:28| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16948)|
| 4:42:31| I'm just sitting here thinking, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16951)|
| 4:42:33| I've never experienced having to deal with anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=16953)|
