| 0:00:23| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=23)|
| 0:00:23| All members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=23)|
| 0:00:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=25)|
| 0:00:26| Commissioner Smith, do you recognize?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=26)|
| 0:00:28| I need to read a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=28)|
| 0:00:30| Because I'm an employee of Knox County's risk management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=30)|
| 0:00:33| I have a conflict of interest in the proposal about to be voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=33)|
| 0:00:38| However, I declare that my argument and my vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=38)|
| 0:00:41| answer only to my conscience and to the obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=41)|
| 0:00:44| to my constituents and to the citizens of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=44)|
| 0:00:48| represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=48)|
| 0:00:49| I also want to point out that I do work in risk management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=49)|
| 0:00:52| And risk management is an internal service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=52)|
| 0:00:55| And Chris, if you would come down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=55)|
| 0:00:57| help me explain how this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=57)|
| 0:00:58| It's not an item that we will actually be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=58)|
| 0:01:01| a line item that we'll be voting on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=61)|
| 0:01:09| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=70)|
| 0:01:13| The org code of which Commissioner Smith is charged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=73)|
| 0:01:19| to is an internal service fund, Fund 266,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=79)|
| 0:01:23| which is on page 14 of the book that I handed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=83)|
| 0:01:26| And those internal service funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| which includes self-insurance, vehicle service fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=88)|
| 0:01:32| the mailroom fund, they are a non-budgeted fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=92)|
| 0:01:37| And we just show them just for informational purposes only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| And so he is not voting for anything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| is affecting him personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| Before we move further, I want to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=109)|
| 0:01:51| some elected officials in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| School board chair Mike McMillan, school board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=114)|
| 0:01:57| Gloria Dethridge, school board member Terry Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=117)|
| 0:02:00| and school board member Patty Bounds also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| And I think former chairman Strickland is in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| too, or was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| So thank you guys for being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| along with the others that are normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| Mayor Burchett's always at our commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| But I want to recognize those also dealing with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| So we've had two people ask for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=138)|
| 0:02:26| Is Tamara Shepard here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| Tamara, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| Tamara Shepard and Lynn Redmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| Is there anybody else that would choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| to speak on public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| What we'll do, Ms. Shepard, it's 4.06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| You'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| My name's Tamara Shepard, 4612 Meredith Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| I think that a new Sentinel editorial that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| ran in Sunday's paper did a pretty succinct job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| of outlining all the reasons we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| to avoid spending $21 million on a Gibbs Middle School now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| So I will again address my comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| as I did the last time I visited to why I believe we should also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| avoid spending $35 million on a Hardin Valley Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| In front of you, you should find a one-page handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| It's entitled, The Tale of Two High Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| Hence, mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| I'd like to direct your attention, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| first to current empty seats at the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| high schools in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| We're talking here about Hardin Valley Academy and Carnes High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| Current empty seats at Hardin Valley Academy are 298.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| Current empty seats at Carnes High School are 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| Between the high schools, you see then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| that we have 1,200 empty seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| Our story begins with how that came to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| In the fall of 2008, 969 Carnes High School students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| were rezoned from their high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| to occupy a new $54 million high school in Hardin Valley, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| was not then needed and which nobody wanted to move into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| Over the seven years since, Carnes High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| has never recovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| It still has 902 empty seats because its student population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| is still being used to mask the gross underutilization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| at the Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| If we return 902 Carnes students to their originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| zoned high school, and we can, if we refill Carnes High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| School, the truth is revealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| The 2,200 seat Hardin Valley Academy has 1,200 empty seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=281)|
| 0:04:50| That bears repeating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| Hardin Valley Academy has 1,200 empty seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| Hardin Valley already has a 1,200 seat middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| It lies within that community's high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| and it is available to you for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| Make Hardin Valley Academy into a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| serving grades 6 through 12, and bank $35 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| Ladies and gentlemen, it is past time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| we filled up that Taj Mahal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| Next on the list is Mr. Len Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| Hello, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Hello, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| Mr. Chairman, members of the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| thank you very much for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| My name is Len Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| I live at 5246 Oak Hill Lane in the Norwood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| My local, since we're talking about schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| and that's why I'm here, about the Memorandum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| of Understanding, my local elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| is Norwood Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| We have some good news this week from the Norwood Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| School, we're getting yet another portable classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| And I say that a little bit sarcastically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| but our situation is so overcrowded there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| and has been for many years, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| delighted to get our 11th, it may be a double one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| we may have 11th and 12th portable classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| I'm here to ask you to think very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| before you approve this Memorandum of Understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| And I understand what I'm talking against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| First of all, it's, quote, a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| Everyone likes a deal, I like deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| There's something in it for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| Commissioners out west would be crazy to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| against a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| Commissioners out east, the same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| I'm not from out west or from out east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| I'm one of the neighborhoods that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| has suffered for years with elementary school overcrowding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| whether it's Adrian Burnett, or Inskip, or Powell, or Norwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| or a multitude of others, we all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| forests of portable classrooms with no hope in sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| The day you approve this Memorandum of Understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| dooms our part of town to not getting any relief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| for another five or 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| We understand that, I hope you do when you cast your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| I could refer to you all kinds of documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| The school board paid $75,000 for a study of middle schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| presented to them in March of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| It said, while there's going to be some surge going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| through the middle schools for the next five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| basically the facts do not show, the population does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| show that we need any new middle schools in the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| And again, I understand the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| But it's a bad deal for the students involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=475)|
| 0:08:02| Talking about portable classrooms is one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| Let me give you an example from Norwood, not this past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| but the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| A school psychologist would come out a couple of days a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| to Norwood to counsel some troubled children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| Norwood was so overcrowded, sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| there was no portable private room for her to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| She would do that in the halls, talking to the kid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| as hundreds of other kids walked by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| Education needs to be a little bit better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| than that in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| And that's what we're trapped into now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| We have been for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| Without the possibility now of a new elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| in the northwest area, it's not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| I ask you to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| Also, as a taxpayer, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| We can all cheer that there's no tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| If you have any familiarity with budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| you know that we are building in infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| and we're going to have operating costs for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| We're funding teachers' raises out of a one-time thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| and that's not a permanent funding example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| That's not a good way to do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| I ask you to consider seriously voting against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=551)|
| 0:09:11| Thank you, Mr. Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| Any others in the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| All right, commissioners, what we have before us today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| are four items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| We'll go through them one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=563)|
| 0:09:34| Item number two, resolution R-15-6-101-SS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| is approving an intergovernmental memorandum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| of understanding between and among the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| Commission, the Knox County Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| and the Knox County Mayor regarding teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| compensation, the building of a Gibson Middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| School and a Hardin Valley Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| and the financing thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| I would move that we accept this memorandum of understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| and approve it and make it operational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| as it affects the county budget and the capital spending plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=615)|
| 0:10:15| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| Number one, I know we have three of the school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| They haven't voted on this yet, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| We vote on it and they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| It's down the drain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| What is the feeling, Mr. Chairman, of the school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| Surely you have some feedback that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| could give us as far as what the feelings of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| are at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| Or Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| Mr. Chair, I think that's the end of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| I can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| Yeah, I think that they'll end up deliberating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| Yeah, I know that they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| They haven't had discussion about it as a group yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=668)|
| 0:11:15| Mike McMillan, Chairman of the School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| For anybody that does not know, Commissioner Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| as you are well aware, we cannot talk to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| So I have not talked to any other members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| as far as what their wishes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| I understand in talking to the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| that there are several that support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=702)|
| 0:11:49| And we intend to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| Or it's our intentions, if it is approved here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| that we would deal with it at our regular meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=715)|
| 0:12:03| the 1st of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| While you're up there, I know that Ms. Shepherd has probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| made this same presentation to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| at the school board meetings before that she just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| read off a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| I've seen that information before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| I don't agree with it necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| I don't agree with what she's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| That's about the only comment that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| Has or has not been discussed at the school board meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| Has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| I don't think individually that it's been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| But Dr. McIntyre is here if you wish to hear what he has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=763)|
| 0:12:51| He probably can give you a better understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| since he can talk to all the board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| The reason I look back there, he wasn't here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| He got caught in traffic and came in right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| I personally do not believe that what Ms. Shepherd has to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| would have any merit dealing with the majority of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| That's my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| I've not discussed that with individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| Thanks, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| Any other questions of the chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| As Commissioner Brown pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| I think we're putting the cart before the horse on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| And I think more importantly, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| nothing in this memorandum, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| nothing in the budgetary change that the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| and the superintendent discussed that we can't do later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| This thing has just been put before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| If you remember when we were discussing the Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| Elementary issue, Commissioner Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| asked for us not to vote on the capital part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| We may want to consider doing that again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| or vote on the capital plan, the original capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| And that way, we can get into the details of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| Ms. Shepherd presented something to, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| the public for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| And there's some valid salient points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| I remember the discussion of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| It was planned for $1,200 with growth to $2,224.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| So I would like to dig into those numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| because that was the original plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| And so I think that this is, I'm going to call it hasty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=891)|
| 0:14:58| but I don't think we've done due diligence at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| As I look at this memorandum, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| is just a cursory glance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| Some of the things that concern me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| are what the public speakers spoke on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| We're talking about a one-time bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| bring up recurring revenue to get a 2% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| So a one-time fee, and we always talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| I mean, Chris has counseled us well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| Let's not use one-time funds to fund a recurring cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| That's a death blow, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| So again, I don't fully understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| Chris hasn't presented this to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| in a workshop or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| But that's what this seems to look like to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| Well, we're going to do a one-time fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| to handle a recurring raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| Once we give that raise, we can't take it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| But then more important than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| if we get to a point where the budget doesn't allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| or the natural growth doesn't allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| we're going to cut teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| We're already going to cut teachers for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| But we're going to tie our hands to where we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| we can't increase our revenue stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| We have to make cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| I question the superintendent agreeing to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| I think this is some serious, serious concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| And these are things that we're just not getting to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| And we're talking about voting in the next little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| Another thing that worries me is we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| talking about holding the capital improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| plan until 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| We can't open it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| Not to mention binding other commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| As the law director said, this really isn't worth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| I think, what I've read him to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| this isn't worth the paper it's written on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| as far as an obligation goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| But we're talking about, in spirit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| binding other commissions to 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| not to do any more capital improvement in Knotts County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| other than what's written down today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| If we look at the capital improvement plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| there would be no Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| There would be no change to Chihuahua.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| There'll be no change to these other schools that kind of came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| because things evolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| And so, again, to reduce the education expenditures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| we're talking about cutting failing programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| I would like to have someone define to me what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| a failing program that we would cut would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| Is it athletics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Is it academics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| Is it a transportation issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| I just don't know what a failing program looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| Sounds like the early intervention reading program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| must be failing because that's already decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| We'll phase that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| That's going to go to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| But then we're also talking about reducing employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| We all know from a physical plant standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| we don't have enough janitors as it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| So we're not talking about that level of employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| We're talking about taking a million dollars out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| the superintendent's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| He's not cutting teachers, so that's coming out of AHA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| building, I'm guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| So we would have already made a significant cut there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| So what's left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Classroom teachers, increased classroom sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| Again, I question superintendent's wisdom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| in entering into this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| And then lastly, we're talking about what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| call traditional class schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| I don't know what a traditional class schedule looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| We've been pushing block scheduling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| We've gotten all As.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| This block scheduling is supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| to be a successful program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| That's what I'm seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| I'm seeing the growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| I'm seeing the, even in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| Austin East is, I think, one of the only high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| to have been on the list at the last level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| and to be off that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Well, we're still not where we want to be, but that's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| I think they're the only school in the state that's done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| So we're talking about eliminating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| these traditional classroom schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| Again, I don't know what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| I would like to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| This thing is being pushed before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| And again, but my point is, this may go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| But I don't think we've had the time enough to vet it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| because there's nothing in this memorandum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| that we can't vote on in December or January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| or February or August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| OK, so the school board hasn't presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| So I want to put that out there just for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| And I'll say, Ms. Shepard, I'll have to defer to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| are you OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| OK, Ms. Shepard, would you like to say something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| about what I've commented on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| Mr. Chairman, if I didn't use my five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| I'd appreciate the opportunity to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| to Commissioner McKenzie's earlier point concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| What you see, if you'll study that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| is that our major projects are consolidated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| at the front end of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| For the last three years of this five-year unamendable plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| you see no other renovations and additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| You see no other major projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| With regard to the one minuscule renovation remaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| on the five-year plan, namely Adrian Burnett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| I wanted to bring to your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| that that budget has been cut in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| Adrian Burnett was most recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| and I say most recently because that poor school has languished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| on the capital plan for nearly 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| Adrian Burnett's budget was cut from $10 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| as scheduled last year, to $4.5 million this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| Furthermore, concerning the North Central Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| which does benefit five schools, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| is proposed to remove or reduce 55 portable classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| at those five schools, that school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| has been dropped completely, as Mr. Redman pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| And because we don't even have design money in this five-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| plan, the planning process on a North Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| could not begin until 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| The school could not be constructed until 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| We're really talking about an eight-year delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| on what both the county and the media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| have long identified as our top priority in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1301)|
| 0:21:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| And I'd be willing to bet, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| think Gibbs parents, Hardin Valley parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| if they went out to Adrian Burnett, they would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| I mean, honestly, if they walked the halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| they really, really, and honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| in their heart of hearts, would agree that this is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| So I'd struggle with that, with where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| But thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| Yes, Commissioner Orloby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| Either Chris or the mayor, whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| I just have a question about this, one part on this MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| Sorry, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| While you're walking down, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| my question is, where it says teacher compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| it says Knox County will pay Knox County Schools $3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| on or after November 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| And it references that same date on section 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| What's the reference for November 24?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| Is that a cutoff for the implementation of the bonus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| Well, it's a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| I do believe that the 24th is when the teachers receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| the apex bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| The other reason that date is in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| is our cash flows get really low in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| And we did not want to go ahead and transfer that over in July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| and it be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| And we may have to issue a line of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| So it's more of a cash flow issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| Oh, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| Also, about the number 11, maybe you all can correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1397)|
| 0:23:25| It talks about that this improvement plan should not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| be amended until fiscal year 2021| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| unless by mutual agreement of all parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| So it's not like it's edge to stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| We could come back two years from now and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| we want to amend this if both parties agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| Yeah, I think it would be an agreement between the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| the commission, and the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| So it's not like nobody can amend it ever and ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| It can be amended within that five-year time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| Is that the normal process, anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| It is the normal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| I'd like to say that that part was added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| and I do that that part was just added to the one that just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| got to us today, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| You done, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| Chris, could you come back to the microphone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| for just a second, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| Memorandum that we just got has some wording changes on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| Could you point that out to us, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| the difference was from the original one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| and what we do have in our hands now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| Number 11, as was noted, did change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| And it was just unless agreed upon by all parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1480)|
| 0:24:46| We amended number 12 to end by saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| the Knox County Schools and the Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| commit to working cooperatively in this effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| to select an appropriate new site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| Those are the two things that did change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| When did these change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| Yeah, when did this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| When did it change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| Wow, that was Tuesday or Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| I think it was Wednesday or Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| Dr. McIntyre, do you remember when we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| Midweek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1523)|
| 0:25:30| Commissioner Bussler, you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| Commissioner Brolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| Well, I don't necessarily oppose a middle school at Gibbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| or at Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| I don't think enough has been considered yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| in terms of other options or in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| of what the impact might be on Holston Middle and Vine Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| And are we trading long bus rides in one direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| for long bus rides in another direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| And are we truly taking into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| the long-term projections in the studies that have been done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| I'm all in favor of neighborhood and community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| I like the idea of smaller neighborhood schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| much better than the big mega schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| I understand that they're more expensive to operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| more difficult to staff, and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| But I think I've seen enough studies that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| show that students tend to do better in smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| neighborhood-based schools than they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| do in the larger mega schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| So I want everyone to understand that my position doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| mean that I oppose these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| I just think that there is a better way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| to get there than what we currently have before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| I think that there's definitely a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| for some kind of relief in the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| And I think there are some very good arguments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| have been put forth regarding our current use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| or actually underutilization of existing facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| and space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| And I think that might be a good short-term option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| while we could utilize, while we figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| the absolute best long-term solution, which in my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| doesn't include going into this kind of debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| after we've worked so hard to pay down our debt for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| I think that the MOU sets up an already strained relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| between the BOE and the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| I think it sets it up to fail, a relationship that's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| strained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| And when that happens, the two groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| that are going to suffer the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| are going to be our teachers and our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| I think probably one of the things that bothers me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| the most about this agreement is that it completely leaves out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| the school that is the one that's most desperately needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| and that there are the fewest options for the elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| When you look at the facilities report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| and see the number of portables in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| and then you look at this MOU, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| obvious that the less affluent and less politically powerful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| areas in the county are the ones that continue to lose out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| Inskip, Norwood, and Powell, between them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| have, I think, at least 55 portable classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| Adrian Burnett is a mess and desperately needs help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| And this MOU leaves that new elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| completely out and seems to be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| concerned with projected and community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| needs over our current needs, which I think desperately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| And I also agree that the school board has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| had an opportunity to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| Changes were made to this less than a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| It was only announced a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| Changes had been made to it during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| And we can amend the capital plan regardless of what then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| as Bud had said, quite true, there's no teeth to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| There's no way to enforce it on either side, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| is why I think it sets up an already strained relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| to fail, because there are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| to have to be changes made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| But I think we can amend the capital plan at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| And I think it makes more sense to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| what was already on the table and take some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1787)|
| 0:29:55| a couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| It doesn't have to be six months or a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| but just six weeks, a couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| to really study this and to look at all of the options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1802)|
| 0:30:08| and see what the absolute best options are for our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| moving forward, so that we aren't just addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| projected and community needs, but current needs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| And that when we do meet these needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| we're doing it in the way that's best for the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| So that was all that I had to add to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| Sam brought up a point a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| pardon me, I meant to mention it and I didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| which is spelled out in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| And as Chris mentioned in his remarks earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| that this money for this raise is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| to be considered maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| Dr. McIntyre, are these raises going to be cut next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| If you're referring to the apex, it is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| is that what you're talking about, the apex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| That's a bonus that's not reoccurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| Yeah, but there's also talk of the 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| Is that associated with this one time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| It's in the same sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| It's got to be a lawyer, but I agree with Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| You know, Amy mentioned that maybe there's a better track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| Where is it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| We're not the experts in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| They're supposed, the BOE is supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| to be the experts in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| But over the last six years, seven years almost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| that I've been sitting in this seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| I've seen things go down, down, down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| get deeper and deeper and deeper in a hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| What the mayor and Chris and Dr. McIntyre agreed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| and put together in this MOU is a hand-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| a way to plug a hole in the dike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| Now, it may not be the best ballgame in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| but right now, the way I see it, it's their only game in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| But that doesn't mean, as it says in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| this thing can be altered whenever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| it need be under agreement by both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| This gives them a track to run on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| But they need some help right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| to get out of a difficult situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| and that's what the mayor has offered in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| So I think, based on the discussion we've had here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| so far and the answers that we've gotten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| this is the only way to go right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| What the MOU does is we pay for the apex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| and that frees up the school's recurring revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| to pay for the recurring cost of the 2% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| And so the schools can determine if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| want to continue with apex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| But as far as we're concerned, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| one-time money for an expense that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| not recurring at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| And apex is being discussed right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| whether or not they want to keep it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| Yeah, Chris, could you come back for a sec?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| So what you're saying, you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| to free up enough money for FY16 to give the 2% raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| Correct, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| But in 17, if you choose not to free up that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| the school board has to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| That 2% that they got in 16 out of their balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| out of the monies that we give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| Or take it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| They're paying for it in 16, because all we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| is we're saying the apex money that would be the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| for the apex raise, which they were paying for out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| of recurring revenue, is now being paid for by us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| out of one-time revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| So that recurring revenue is freed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| to be paying for a recurring salary expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| So all we're saying is our one-time money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| will go to this one-time expense of apex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| And then if they wanted to keep apex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| they would have to create those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| So again, it's kind of a share game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| It's too hard, but it's kind of a, OK, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| going to move this to pay the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| Well, I have one other question, and I'll come back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| The AJ building, and we've talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| about this in our joint education committee somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| Who gets that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| The sale of the Andrew Johnson building, does that go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| to the county or to the school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| It is a county-owned facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| The county did purchase that facility several years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| when issued bonds to pay for it and to renovate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| Now, we've had discussions, the mayor and Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| McIntyre, about as we go forward in selling this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2111)|
| 0:35:17| we know there's moving cost, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| know there's things that's going to be associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| And so we're going to work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| to make sure that is done appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| But as far as the sale of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| I would imagine that would just go into the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| to sell the county property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| So that's been an ongoing issue, because as you look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| folks back in the 80s and 90s, whenever we purchased it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| it was purchased for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| And so you would think that that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| that those monies that we used to buy it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| will come back to education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| But that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| And again, that's become an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| with a lot of these facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| Again, we're obligating ourselves here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| to get out of negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| And I'll encourage the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| I think you need to read the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| I think county commission needs to read this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| And to me, it's not about a power or who has control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| but it's about the proper people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| and I'll say it hopefully for the last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| staying in their lanes and doing the part of the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| that the taxpayers and our constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| have entrusted us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| We have a role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| They have a role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| I think this muddies the water up tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| And more importantly, there's been a change in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| I guess I pulled an earlier email that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| didn't have that it would be by joint agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| So even the superintendent and the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| the original document wasn't settled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| because things like this are difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| This has to be an iterative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| I'm sure the school board's going to not like every word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| here, and they may want to tweak it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| So I just think that we're entering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| I don't disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| We may agree with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| This might be the best thing going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| However, we're not doing our jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| if we haven't vetted this properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| And I don't think that can happen within Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| to Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| If the last version came out Wednesday and today's Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| I just don't think that's a proper time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| So I'd like to introduce a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| that we delay voting on this for 90 days, not forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| but for 90 days, while school board takes a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| We can get a feel, a true feel, for what their feelings are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| And then we can bring it back before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Again, this doesn't affect the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| but we'll vote on the budget in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| So I'd like to introduce that as a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Motion is seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Any discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| You can only just have a discussion on the 90-day delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| Madam Clerk, if you'll call the roll for a 90-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2295)|

| 0:38:22| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2302)|
| 0:38:22| Commissioner Smith passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2302)|

| 0:38:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| No is your vote, or no, do you don't want to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| Do you wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| You want to vote, and your vote is no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| Vote is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| Commissioner Smith votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| All right, motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| Back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Dr. McIntyre, could you come down here, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| And thank you for recognizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2356)|
| 0:39:23| How are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| I'm great, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2366)|
| 0:39:26| Doing good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| I like to look at things, and I usually analyze them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| from a worst case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| So I want to throw two scenarios at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| First, if we continue along the path of our natural growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| that we've seen the trend for the last five, six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| how detrimental could this be to your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| And the second question is, if we have something that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| and I know the economy is looking pretty good right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| but it was looking pretty good in 2006, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| If a bubble were to pop, and we went into a flat, or even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| a little bit of a negative, how detrimental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| would that be to the education system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| Well, I certainly think that would be challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| And we certainly saw a dynamic like that in 2008, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| We saw not just flat revenue, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| saw a decrease of sales tax revenue of about $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| And clearly, that was extreme, and hopefully unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| in that we won't see that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| But yeah, that would be challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| I think what this proposal allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| to happen, if approved by the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| and approved by the board, is it allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| us to continue the conversation around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| how do we make sure that we are utilizing the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| that we have available and that are maximized to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| student learning and success, while recognizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| some of the limitations, very real limitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| that we have around revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| And we've done a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| The school board has done a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| We've done a lot of that on Knox County School's side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| And I think this potential agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| allows us to continue that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| in a really meaningful way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| Commissioner Bustler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| You know, we can go around this over and over and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2474)|
| 0:41:14| But we've got a situation here where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| we can remedy some problems that we have facing us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| And to go back and bring up things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| that should have been taken care of years and years and years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| ago, and say, you know, this should have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| We should do this first before we get into the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| that we're in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| You mentioned in my area, Adrian Burnett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| you have Powell Middle School that wasn't finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| when it was remodeled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| You have Powell High School that needs a cafeteria redone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| You have Halls High School that needs a remodel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| It's not been taken care of quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| You have Powell Elementary with all these portables out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| I'm not an educator, but I'm telling you what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| it is pathetic what has happened in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| But we have other districts, too, that are coming along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| that's going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| And one wrong that's been done to a community for many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| has been Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| And I don't have any voters that vote for me out in Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| but I think that they need their school out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| They've got a community that they're trying to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| And if we don't do these things, we tear down communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| We don't build communities, we tear them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| So we've got a chance to start right now and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| here's where we're moving forward to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| And then maybe down the road, we can come back and start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| addressing the issues that we've needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| to address for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| So we just need to buckle down right now and say, here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| we're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| And I'm going to say, unless somebody else wants to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| I'm going to call a question for the vote to move it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| I think we're done, unless somebody else got anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| All right, the motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| We'll do a roll call vote starting in the first, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2585)|

| 0:43:44| Motion passes 9 to 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| We'll go on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2626)|
| 0:43:55| Item is Resolution R-15-6-102-SS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| It's establishing a general county budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| and making appropriations from the several funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| for departments, institutions, offices, and agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| of Knox County, Tennessee for the fiscal year beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| July 1, 2015 and ending June 30, 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| I move to approve as amended by the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| And I'd like for the commissioners just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| to hear me out, hear what I'm asking you to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| and why I'm asking you to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| And I won't take long, but I'll lay it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| I'm asking, I think we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| how the vote's going to go, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| would ask that we vote on the school's capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| I would like, because what I don't want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| is vote against the sheriff's cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| What I would like to do is not, is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| It's in Resolution 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| OK, but I want to get the point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| give you time to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| I would ask that you look at the other aspects of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2714)|
| 0:45:21| this particular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| And well, let me stop and ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2723)|
| 0:45:32| The capital plan is in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| I mean, it's in Item 5, but the memorandum of understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| in my reading kind of reaches back into the original,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| into both, so I'm correcting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| So, and I don't know how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| What I don't want to do, and I'll consider that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| is to not vote for a 90% thing, or a 95%, 98% thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2756)|
| 0:46:02| based on the 2% thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| So I guess I'll ask the law director if that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2764)|
| 0:46:14| Commissioner, I'm not really sure what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| What is before you is the resolution of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| as amended by the MOU, which is the operational part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| So you either vote for the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| or you vote the motion down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| I don't know that you can do a line item vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| is what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| I don't think you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2791)|
| 0:46:31| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| You know, and that's kind of my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| It just kind of muddies things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| But that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| I will start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| Oh, I'm sorry, Commissioner Rose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| That's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| No, I don't want to vote against the new cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| for the Sheriff's Department, or teacher raises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| or raises for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| I think anybody who's watched me over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| knows that no one has fought more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| for raises for our employees, or for teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| or new cars for the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| or any of those things, more than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| But with the MOU as part of this, I can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| And also, my no vote is more of a protest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| in terms of, while I support all of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| I don't believe that we're going far enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| We should be paving 60 to 80 miles of road per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| We're doing about a third of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| We should be replacing 45 to 55 law enforcement vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| per year, and we're doing about half of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| Our employees haven't received the raises that they deserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| and that they need to keep up with the cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| We have more and more employees who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| are either having to utilize, or looking into utilizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| public assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| Our senior population is exploding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| and we're not prepared for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| The population of our county's increased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| but we haven't added any new law enforcement officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| in, I think, since the 90s, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| The population of the detention facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| has increased, but we haven't added any new corrections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| We're offering our employees raises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| and we're going to the employer part of our health insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| premiums, we're going to be kicking in a little bit extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| But it looks like it's entirely likely that come January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| we're going to be asking our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| to be kicking in more on their share of health insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| premiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| So we're giving them a little bit of a raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| but we're going to turn around in a few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| and take quite a bit of it away, if that's what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2935)|
| 0:49:02| So I support all of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| I don't think this budget goes far enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| in doing those things, which is where my vote opposing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| Commissioner Olby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| Kind of along those lines, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| I agree with the budget for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| There is some things I would like to see us expand on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| And I did talk to Chris about those today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| and I hope and I would urge that the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| if we have any surplus or anything coming in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| or September, that we look at the rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| squad about increasing their funds a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| They do provide an excellent service for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| So it's just something to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| But as far as the budget overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| I think it's a very good sound budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| No other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| We'll have to do a roll call vote on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| So we'll start in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3004)|

| 0:52:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| As I often tell my constituents, as they lament with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3151)|
| 0:52:38| about the room and how I'm generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| on the opposite sides of most votes that are controversial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| I tell them that I may not get six votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| but I do get to turn my red light on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| and voice, represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| And that's what I've tried to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| I'm not part of anyone's network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3187)|

| 0:53:21| That's what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| I represent my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| I would hope that everyone here represents their district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| and maybe we'll get 10 and 11 to represent Knotts County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| But what I will say is every email I talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| about a community school, your community schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| that you're wanting in the deep recesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| ends up challenging our community schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| And I'll go fourth to one and nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3231)|
| 0:53:58| They challenge those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| And so we need to represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| To me, these votes should be a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| If we're representing all the people that voted us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| or that could have voted us in, because it's not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| the people that voted for us that I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| I represent both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| I represent my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| And so this capital improvement plan is a bad one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| It was a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| It was a sound one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| The mayor sat here with a room full of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| and extolled the virtues of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| And then I guess someone tapped him on the shoulder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| woke up at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| I don't know what happened, but something happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| And he's gone away from the tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| that don't agree with him on, but I actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| respected him on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| And he's just really gone away from his nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3287)|
| 0:54:54| And so that's sad to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| Because again, I don't have to agree with his votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| but I like a man or a woman that stands up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| for what they believe in, and they're true to their word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| So that hadn't happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| We all sat here in the original budget, and we talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| It's a difficult. A lot of us, I would say a majority of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| talked about how it was a difficult thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| And then magic happens, and then we vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| We vote for this mysterious, nebulous thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| that no one really truly understands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| but strings are attached, I'm guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| So this is a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| And the superintendent, to go for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| my last hope is that the school board would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| have some reasonableness and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| I may not like a thing that the superintendent's doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| but I'm jeopardizing my job if I agree to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| I'm jeopardizing what the people have elected me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| We just did that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| If the school board needs to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| and it's not about the school, it's about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| This process lets the elephant get underneath your tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| Be wary when he gets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| We've just bastardized the process is what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| The whole process is just out the door now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| Now we let outside influences come and have major decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3377)|
| 0:56:25| This isn't a small thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| This isn't a victory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| This isn't about a Gibbs or a Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| It really isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| People know how I feel, but my vote is my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| If I lose a vote, it won't be the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| So it's not about a vote, a four against Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| a four against Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| It's about we spent $75,000 on a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| We didn't stick to that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| We had 1,000 people here and listening between the two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| listening to a speech about what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| and how we're doing it going forward in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| and then we get an 11th hour deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| So this capital plan, again, is a bad one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| And again, while I've been the minority vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| on a lot of issues over these past eight budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| I guess I've gone through, this one is at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| There was one other, but this one's close to the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| of being very, very disappointing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| just about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| This is this max of backroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| You know, when I was running for office last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| I did not imagine that this would come about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| but I'm so happy that this plan has come about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| This answers most of many questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| that were given to me around the entire Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| that I ran in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| It also addresses a lot of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| that this commission has not addressed in decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| We are moving forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| We are moving in a working relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| We're moving and checking numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| checking expenditures, working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| where the mayor and the superintendent of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| can stand side by side and work together for an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3503)|
| 0:58:27| So this isn't about separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| I don't think there's anything wrong with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| Yeah, we're going to have some changes in the years to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| There's going to be changes anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| Nothing stays the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| Yes, we will have to get more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| Yes, we will have to find more funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| And yes, we may have to change some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| but that's what we're here for, to work this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| I applaud this effort by the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| and the superintendent of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| No, we're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| We're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| If you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| We need a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| Starting with the first district, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3542)|

| 0:59:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| When you were introducing members of the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| earlier this afternoon, it was before Teddy Bear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| the youngest member of the Board of Education, came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| I noticed he wasn't signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| but he's been speaking quite a bit here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| for the last few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| I do recognize he is accompanied by his mom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| a member of the Board of Education, Amber Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| All right, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| This meeting here, this section of the meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150615Special?start=3612)|
