| 0:14:19| I just want to give you a precautionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| You're getting an on and off premise beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| and if you serve people that have consumed alcohol and some go down the road and kill somebody, you can be liable for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| So be careful who you serve with your on and off premise permit, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=879)|

| 0:14:45| We are adjourned until 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| If you'll go ahead and take your seats, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=890)|
| 0:15:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| I'm going to go ahead and call the county commission into order for the month of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| Clerk, if you'll call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=911)|

| 0:15:31| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=931)|

| 0:15:33| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=933)|

| 0:15:35| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| Without objection, Mr. Mayor, I'd like to move the mayor's discussion and proclamation up to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| We had talked about a fair housing month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| Mayor, if you don't mind to come down, and we'll go ahead and take care of that and dispense with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| through the rest of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=945)|
| 0:15:52| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| If I could ask all of our partners in housing to come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=955)|
| 0:16:13| All the groups that are represented here are, well, why don't you read?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| I can't read your writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| She gets very nervous on the mic, so nobody look at her, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| We have Helen Ross McNabb represented today, KCDC, Sertoma, KHP, CAC, NHI, and Breakthrough Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=983)|
| 0:16:31| And all these agencies provide some level of housing in Knox County for emergency transitional permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| that have very different core issues of life that make it difficult for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| And so we're here to honor our agencies, but HUD proclaims next month as fair housing month, so we're doing it preemptively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1004)|
| 0:16:53| All right, Mr. Chairman, if I read this or would you prefer me not to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| You can plagiarize it if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Why don't we just read the first and the last and we'll skip the middle because it's wordy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| The Congress of the United States of America passed the Fair Housing Act, Title VIII Civil Rights Act of 1968,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1024)|
| 0:17:11| which guarantees the rights of individuals to equal housing opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| And the month of April is recognized by federal, state, and local government as fair housing month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| See, even little ones like fair housing month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| In recognition, these governments are joined by property owners and managers, realtors, financial institutions, landlords,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| tenants, and all those committed to the equality of our country's citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| the importance of their fundamental moral and constitutional rights, which prohibit, among other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1056)|
| 0:17:44| And whereas the mayor supports fairness and equal opportunity in housing throughout Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| to ensure our community's positive and successful social, cultural, and economic growth and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| Now, therefore, I'm Tim Burchett, Knox County Mayor, to hereby proclaim April 2015 as Fair Housing Month in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1073)|
| 0:18:11| Mayor, can we get the speaker's name for the clerks, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| No, just the speaker, the lady that spoke. I just need her name for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| Sorry, Rebecca Gibson, 400 Bain Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| Thank you. Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1101)|
| 0:18:29| All right, according to the agenda, of course, this is a new time for our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| According to the agenda, there's time for a public forum placed at the beginning of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| And what I would ask is if there's any public forum that's not related to an agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| if you would like to speak in regard to that. Is there anybody here for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As a part of public forum, I'd like to recognize Patty Bounds, member of the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| 7th District is here with us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| I appreciate you being informed of the actions of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| Also, on a more somber note, Richard Talmadge Beeler passed March 12, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1142)|
| 0:19:11| Richard was a faithful servant of the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| If there be no objection, I request the law director to prepare a memorial resolution to be presented at our next regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1155)|
| 0:19:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| And on that note, Commissioner Brown, condolences to you on the death of your sister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| And I think we'll get the details out fairly soon, but condolences to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| Unexpected and very heartfelt for condolences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| Yes, while we have so many people here, I wanted to make the announcement I was going to save to the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1184)|
| 0:19:52| Are you saying they won't stay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| I'm betting you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| On Tuesday, March 31st at 6 p.m. in the Knox County Health Department auditorium at 140 Dameron Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1198)|
| 0:20:07| in conjunction with the National Foundation for Women Legislators and the Alice Paul Institute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| there will be a free public showing of the movie Iron Jaw and Angels with Angelica Houston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1212)|
| 0:20:20| Hilary Swank, Frances O'Connor, and Julia Ormond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| It's a Golden Globe award-winning film about the fight for women's suffrage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| and Tennessee played a very prominent role in that being the last state needed to ratify the 19th Amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| giving women the right to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| So have some flyers up here if anyone would like to take a flyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| And we would love to have as many people as possible turn out and enjoy this movie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| It is truly wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| And my two youngest daughters have not seen it yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| so I'm really excited to be able to bring them to see it with us that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| So I hope we'll have a good crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| So everyone's invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| I just want you to know that some years ago, he's passed now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| but I actually knew and was friends for five to ten years with Harry Burns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| who was the attorney for them in that movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| And there is actually an effort underway right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| We're raising money to put a statue of Harry Burns up in Knoxville, along with the suffragette statues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1276)|
| 0:21:23| It's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| We'll go ahead and go to the honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Clerk, if you'll proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| honoring local journalists for receiving journalism awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| This is Resolution 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| Commissioner Burles, I think you want it read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Actually, I would like for the clerk to please read the resolution into the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1313)|
| 0:22:00| and for the journalists that are here, as your name is called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| you're invited to join me here at the podium to receive your copy of the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| and remain here with me until everyone's been recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| There's about five, I think, or six journalists here, so we'll be moving rather quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1330)|
| 0:22:17| So please hold your applause until everyone's been recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| And at that point, John, if you wouldn't mind making a group picture for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| And then I have a short statement to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| So, Madam Clerk, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| Whereas several of the journalists working in Knox County recently won professional journalism awards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| and whereas the Knox County Commission desires to honor and thank these journalists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| for their commitment to excellence in journalism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| and whereas these journalists inform, educate, entertain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| and enrich the lives of the people in our community on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| The Commission of Knox County hereby recognizes and honors following local journalists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1374)|

| 0:25:20| that's been done in Knox County over the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| Journalists play a very important role in what we do in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| They make certain the residents of our area are aware of important news and information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| relating not only to government but also to all areas of life in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| They are indispensable, especially in times of crisis or emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| I just realized Mark Harmon was included in this resolution and we skipped him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1540)|

| 0:25:51| Here you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| As politicians, we may occasionally grumble about how a story is covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| or what we look like in a photo or what particular quote that gets printed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| but the bottom line is that our community couldn't function without the work that these people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| It's exciting to see how many of them have been honored for their excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1569)|

| 0:26:19| I thought it would go fairly quickly when I first started working on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| but I learned we have an incredible number of journalists that have been honored over the past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| and we're indeed fortunate to be beneficiaries of so much talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| We have had more journalists awarded for their work than in any other market in East Tennessee region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| And unfortunately, most of them couldn't be here today because they are currently at work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| especially our broadcast journalists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| So I'm proud of their work and I'm grateful for what they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| and glad to have the opportunity to honor them publicly today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| This is an especially appropriate time to honor them coming right on the heels of Sunshine Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| So thank you to all of them and thank you for joining me in showing our appreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1618)|

| 0:27:27| because he makes more meetings and takes more pictures than anybody that I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| And it's kind of hard for the audience to see him because he's above you in the balcony seats up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1652)|
| 0:27:40| But Dan Andrews, stand up and take a bow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1660)|

| 0:28:48| at the Festival Disney in Orlando, Florida, and received superior ratings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| And whereas this excellence allowed the Panther Company to be adjudicated by three distinguished choral professors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| including Dr. Russell Robinson, a well-known author, composer, and arranger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| From the University of Florida and Dr. Jerry Blackstone of the University of Michigan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| who is a two-time Grammy award-winning conductor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| And whereas following their performance, the Panther Company was coached by Dr. Blackstone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| who highlighted what they did well and challenged them in the techniques of their ability to communicate the music to the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1758)|
| 0:29:27| And whereas in his adjudication notes from the Panther Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1767)|

| 0:29:36| and the solid quality choral technique being taught to the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| And whereas the Powell Middle School Panther Company is directed by Drew Carpenter and Allison Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| The Knox County Commission hereby honors, recognizes the Powell Middle School Panther Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1790)|

| 0:30:30| So they scored the highest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| And that's why I wanted them to be recognized, because of their talent, because of the diligence of their leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=1833)|

| 0:34:58| the commission of Knox County hereby honors all women's group in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2098)|

| 0:35:07| Knox County citizens to acknowledge and celebrate the many contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| and achievements of women in our history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| Be it further resolved that if any notifications are to remain to effectuate this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| then the county clerk is hereby requested to forward a copy of this resolution to the proper authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| as provided by the charter of Knox County, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| Women show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| This is wonderful to have such a wonderful group of women here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| Each year during Women's History Month I make it a point to honor local women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| for their achievements here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| In the past we've honored specific women leaders or small groups of women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| who've had an impact on our community, and this year I decided it would be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| to recognize all of the various women's groups in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| And when I began doing research for this resolution, I was pleasantly surprised and gratified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| to find so many diverse groups representing women in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| Most of them I was aware of, but some of them were totally new to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| These are all groups that are either organized and led by women, comprised only of women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| or serve mostly or only women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| They're community groups, groups that focus on the social, religious, health, sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| political, and business issues of women, or groups that have organized where they see a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| or where they are in service to their surrounding community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| I know that there are a few women's groups that I've probably left out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| for which I apologize, it was not intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| And I ask that these groups please do follow up with me, contact me after today's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| We were going to do a follow-up resolution to make sure that no one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| no women's group in Knox County gets left out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| because these groups fill an important role in our society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| And what all these groups have in common is that as diverse as they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| and as wide-ranging as these topics are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| they exist to uplift, support, and further the success and participation of Knox County women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| Thank you for joining me in recognizing their contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| and honoring them today during Women's History Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2245)|

| 0:37:45| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, honoring Mark Harmon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| upon the occasion of his receipt of the Sigma Delta Chi Award for Excellence in Journalism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2269)|
| 0:37:57| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2277)|

| 0:38:08| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| It's my great honor today to recognize Mark Harmon for winning the prestigious Sigma Delta Chi Award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| which was presented at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| for an entire series of columns that he authored for the Knoxville News Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| Mark gives a voice to many in Knoxville who feel they are often overlooked and never heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| Mark is an excellent writer, teacher, and he's also one of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| He's a former county commissioner representing District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| His students, we often see them in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| They often attend commission meetings for assignments, practicing, covering news stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| and he often invites commissioners and other elected officials to his classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| to give his students practice conducting interviews, which is a great deal of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| He is also a mentor and a friend to me and to all of my family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| and so I'm grateful for the opportunity to honor him today not only for winning this award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| but for speaking out on issues that are of concern to all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| and for giving a voice to those who often find themselves in the minority here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| Thank you, Mark, for your service on the commission and for your service in District 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| and for your service to the entire community as a journalist, and I'm proud to present this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2362)|
| 0:39:29| Very few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2369)|
| 0:39:38| Thank you, and thanks to my wife, Becky, who makes all things in my life possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| Thanks to my worthy successor in C2, Amy Broyles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| and thanks to Jolie Bonavita, who makes all of you look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| And that's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| I was going to ask if we could push that to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| We'll just hold it until the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| We'll add it to the agenda and then push it to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| Commissioner Burles, the devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| Selected here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| I like that we meet on Mondays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| Beginning of the week brings an opportunity to focus, to start fresh, and to rediscover our goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| A little over a year ago, I attended a training for spiritual activists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| and at our opening session we were asked to share with the group our most important spiritual practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| and when it was my turn, I realized that one of the most important spiritual practices for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| was going around before commission meetings and hugging as many of you as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2446)|
| 0:40:53| It makes me feel connected to you from my heart center in a way that transcends politics and ideology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2453)|
| 0:41:00| and it helps me focus on what's most important, which for me is good process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| and good relationships with the people with which I work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| So another spiritual practice that I enjoy is yoga and meditation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| and since spring has arrived and we're all grateful for the beautiful sunny weather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| I thought about leading you all in a series of yoga poses called the sun salutation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| But since we were taking a group photo today and I wore a dress, you're off the hook for doing yoga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| But I would like for everyone to sit and relax, not only those of us sitting up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2489)|
| 0:41:37| but everyone who's out in the audience and those at home to sit quietly in silence with us for a few moments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2497)|
| 0:41:47| do some deep breathing while we center ourselves, calm our focus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| and prepare for the important work that we have ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| So if you'll sit with me, please, in silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2517)|
| 0:42:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2547)|
| 0:42:46| Thank you all deeply and sincerely for sharing that moment with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| Amen, shalom, namaste, amin, and blessed be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2571)|
| 0:42:59| And our pledge today will be led by Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| So if we all stand and face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2599)|
| 0:43:30| I'll entertain a motion for approval of the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2614)|

| 0:43:40| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| All right, we need to do the amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| And I think we have before you Resolution 105's honorarium for Magistrate Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2627)|
| 0:43:54| We're going to move it to the end, but we'll include it in our motion to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2639)|

| 0:44:13| Yes, I'd like to move the Purple Cities Alliance Dementia Awareness to the beginning of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2653)|
| 0:44:21| You had made that suggestion at the work session that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2661)|

| 0:45:43| Awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| Commissioner Burroughs, your discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| Carolyn is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| Come on down, Carolyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| She's going to give us a brief presentation on the Dementia Awareness and Purple Cities Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2753)|
| 0:46:00| I met Carolyn and her group at the neighborhood conference a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2760)|
| 0:46:10| I have a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Would you like for me to bring it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| I'll get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| You may get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2774)|
| 0:46:22| Let me start by thanking all of you for the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| and particularly Commissioner Burroughs for allowing us to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Name and address, Carolyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| Carolyn Pointer Neal, 1825 River Shores Drive, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2793)|
| 0:46:42| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| Thank you, Carolyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| Again, thank you for allowing us to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| and thank you, Commissioner Burroughs, for opening up this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| I want to start real quickly with a story to tell you really why this alliance is formed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| and then I'm going to tell you a little bit about the goals and mission of the alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| Not too long ago, a few months ago, at our East Knox County Kroger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| an elder lady pulled in and we suppose was going to shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2828)|
| 0:47:16| but she forgot how to get out of her car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| And the normal response that our community has is to try to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2841)|
| 0:47:28| and many, many did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| They did that by surrounding her car, pecking on her windows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| and next thing we know, a fire truck had come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| And while all of that's good and the safe reaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| what we'd like to do as a Purple City Alliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| is to teach public how to better respond in such a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| The lady had brain disease, she had dementia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| and she had just forgotten for a moment what she was there for and how to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2874)|
| 0:48:01| So the Purple Cities Alliance was formed last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| There are some key folks on this alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| This is an alliance strictly of volunteers from our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| Our mission, the Purple Cities Alliance has begun the journey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| toward making Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| one of the first dementia-friendly communities in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| The alliance desires to serve as a model for other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| and other communities across our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| Again, it's made up totally of volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| many of whom work in elder care or related organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| However, many folks on this task force and on this board of advisors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| are there because of a personal experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| We began this conversation because of a friend of ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| Kathy Brogy, who's in elder care services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| She was familiar with the initiative in Europe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| and wanted to bring it to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| So we started by talking to both mayors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| to see if this was something that both of them could support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| and they both generously did so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| So why do we want to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| Because the statistics show that an estimated 44 million people worldwide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2960)|
| 0:49:27| suffer from dementia in its many forms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| Alzheimer's being the most common that we hear about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| And by 2050, it's estimated that 135 million folks worldwide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2974)|
| 0:49:40| will suffer from some form of dementia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| The Purple Cities concept began in Europe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| by a gentleman who was diagnosed with early-onset dementia, Norm McNamara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2987)|
| 0:49:53| He began a grassroots effort in Europe to educate the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| So a Purple City refers to a city or a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| that takes specific steps to help people with dementia feel safer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| when they're out in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| A dementia-friendly city is one that coordinates an effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| among individuals, business, local government agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| nonprofits, health care providers, faith-based communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| and other key stakeholders to learn about dementia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| so that those folks can feel safer and better cared for throughout our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| and continue to function and be an active part of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| So on page 3, you have two slides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| that show the members of our Alliances Board of Advisors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| the Alzheimer's Association of East Tennessee, Alzheimer's Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| Courtyard Senior Living, Elder Advocates, the Pat Summitt Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| the Senior Directory of East Tennessee, Trinity Hills Senior Living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| And then on the next slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| you can see that there are an additional 40 or so organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3053)|
| 0:50:59| that are participating in our task force, again, all as volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| The City of Knoxville and the Knox County Mayor's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| have representatives on our task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| All of the health systems do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| as well as other businesses and organizations throughout our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| So the action steps are that we have a kickoff planned on May 11th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| at 1 o'clock on Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| and at that time, our city, our county, will be declared a Purple City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3085)|
| 0:51:31| We have been and will continue to recruit businesses and organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| to commit to participating in the education that we're providing to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| We will have several forms of education online, on-site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| and a brochure-written form of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| Upon completion, a business or organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| will receive a purple angel window decal, if they so desire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| that will distinguish their business as a dementia-friendly business or organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| And we will continue to provide ongoing educational opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| to new businesses and new employees inside of participating businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| And then we will also encourage other cities and communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| to develop an alliance of their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| and assist them as they so desire in forming their alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| We've listed also on the slide for you all the contact information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| and what I've asked of you today is we would love for you to support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| as an organization, this alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| and we would love to come and actually provide you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| as leaders of our community, the education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| if you would allow us to at some future date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| And I'm open for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| We'll get set up with that through the office, Carolyn, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| Commissioner Burleson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| Yeah, I just wanted to thank Carolyn for coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| As I said, I met her and became aware of her organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| at the Knoxville-Knox County Neighborhood Conference a couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| Dementia, as we all know, is a growing concern all across the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| as our population continues to age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| and as dementia seems to strike earlier and earlier in people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| Knox County, we have a very large population of seniors here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| and it's growing every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| We're also a popular retirement destination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| which adds to our growing number of seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| And, of course, we all back Pat and her fight against dementia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| So I would really love it if we could set up a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| Maybe, I think Carolyn said the training takes maybe 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| Maybe we could do it right before work session next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| or something like that to give the training to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| And I plan to submit a resolution for next month's agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3228)|
| 0:53:54| recommending not requiring but just suggesting and recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| for Knox County businesses and organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| to support dementia awareness in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| and to undergo this valuable training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| I think it's the right thing for us to do for our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| who are struggling with dementia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3249)|

| 1:00:57| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| approving an agreement of sale in the amount of $1,000 for Knox Heritage, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| a property located at 1834 Beach Street, also known as Giffen Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| Resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| We have a motion and a second. Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| This had originally been marked as being a part of the consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| but right after it is also another resolution on the disposition of surplus property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| So I thought maybe if purchasing was here to speak on one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| they might not mind speaking to this 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| But really there isn't any discussion on 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| What I wanted to make the Commission aware of is that in the recent Knox Heritage piece of paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3696)|
| 1:01:45| the Fragile 15, Item 12, Item 12 of the Fragile 15 is school buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3705)|
| 1:01:57| and Giffen is one of those that's on the Fragile list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| And I see it being an important item of Knox County Commission, of Knox County in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3723)|
| 1:02:10| getting this piece of property moved from being surplus to the needs of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| back to the tax roll and someone dealing with either restoring it, refurbishing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3735)|
| 1:02:22| doing something with it that puts it back on the tax rolls and makes it of service to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3742)|
| 1:02:30| South High School is also on that list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| and I think the city is in the process of making sure something is done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3753)|
| 1:02:40| The reason that I bring this up is Rural High School is also listed, 1901 Vermont Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| Rural High School would now see someone's come down from purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3766)|
| 1:02:52| Would purchasing want to say anything about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| It's just a general discussion of us commissioners wanting to make sure that the public in Knox County knows that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3775)|
| 1:03:07| we need to be about moving surplus property back to private ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3787)|
| 1:03:18| And I see conversation taking place in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| I'm not really looking for action from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| I'm looking for action from commission to make sure that we understand that pressure needs to be applied to move these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3807)|
| 1:03:34| not just the one that's listed here, not those that are listed in the Fragile 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| but also looking at the next resolution that's before us to return surplus to the needs of Knox County property to private ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3819)|
| 1:03:49| so that it benefits Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| Ben Charble, Rural Property Coordinator, 1000 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| Commissioner Rule, first of all, is the schools still have Rural High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| They have not surplus that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| They have surplus the football field, and we own the football field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| but we're just going to hold it until we receive the rest of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3848)|
| 1:04:16| When we receive a property when it's surplus to us, particularly the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| we move as quickly as we can to dispose of them, and the same with the delinquent tax process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3860)|
| 1:04:28| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| You know, this topic, and I know Commissioner Wright is very well familiar with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3871)|
| 1:04:37| that was one of our major topics that we didn't fully vet in last year's joint education committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3877)|
| 1:04:47| I voiced a lot of concerns that, you know, those facilities, as goes the school, does the community go and go around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3887)|
| 1:04:55| So, you know, we talked a lot about how the schools tend to hold on to properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3895)|
| 1:05:01| until there's no real value out of it or the community in and around it oftentimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| And so I'm glad you brought that up as a concern here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| and the rule was in particular what we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| And even when they do like they did at Eastport, they let the school go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| but then they kept a portion of it when KCDC was going to come and develop it for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| And, you know, and it just, why are you holding on to a building that's a paint shop, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| So to try to get into some of those decisions and kind of long-range thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| so just for those, you know, to kind of piggyback on what Commissioner Wright was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| and those are some of the things that I think we can continue to have conversations about with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| Commissioner Oldenburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| I agree with Commissioner Wright brought this up, and I agree with Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3945)|
| 1:05:52| Rule has been a discussion for this board for at least three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| It comes up every single time that we have when Oakwood was finally surplused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| and then a month later the roof caved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| and we're getting these buildings too late that we can't do anything with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3966)|
| 1:06:12| or it's costing us money just to get them up to par to sell them to get them back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3972)|
| 1:06:18| So we've got to, and I'm hoping that the new committee, the joint committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| will be able to get this discussed and urge the school system to turn these buildings over sooner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3985)|
| 1:06:33| because we can't continue, because it does affect the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| I mean, Oakwood sat vacant for 20-plus years, and it was so dilapidated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=3998)|
| 1:06:45| and graffiti all over the walls, and it just tears down the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4005)|
| 1:06:51| and the communities that they're in, so we need to do something with these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| When we close them and open a new school, there needs to be some kind of system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| that the school system says, okay, we're going to utilize it for a year or two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| and then we're going to surplus it over because we can't continue to spend taxpayer money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| just to get something up to par to be able to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| So I'm glad that Commissioner Wright brought this up, and it's funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| It's not funny, but every single time we talk about one of these buildings, we bring up a rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4040)|
| 1:07:26| We can bring up other schools, so we need to get these surplused as soon as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| All right, we've got a motion and a second. Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| Any opposed? The ayes have it. Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| Consideration of a resolution approving the method of disposition, public auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| or negotiated sale for delinquent tax surplus properties owned by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| Approving the sale of the properties for less than taxes owed pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| Subsection 67-5-2507, and fixing the offering price for the properties. Resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4074)|
| 1:08:02| Is there a motion? I so move. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| We have a motion and a second. Mr. Thomas and Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| Oh, not that building, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| Any discussion? Motion is Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| Point out that it did pass unanimously, as you can see here at our workshop meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4096)|
| 1:08:23| but one reason we wanted to pass it on today was if anybody else had any comments they wanted to put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4103)|
| 1:08:29| All right, we have a motion. Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| Since purchasing has come down, what's the process to be so that people that hear us tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4112)|
| 1:08:37| will know what's going on about getting these moved back to the public ownership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| The process moving forward from here, once you approve this resolution, they will go to auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4122)|
| 1:08:51| The signs have to go up. We have to advertise for 30 days per purchasing code or procurement code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4131)|
| 1:08:59| and we'll have about 30 days, and they will be auctioned through Powell Auction and Realty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| It's a similar process to the tax sale in that it will be an online auction to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4144)|
| 1:09:11| but then we have to go through the rebid process after that, which any property that's rebid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4151)|
| 1:09:18| just like in the tax sale, an individual has an opportunity to rebid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| and those properties would then go to a live auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| But once this is approved, they'll go to auction in about a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| These properties went to the tax sale last year and had a one-year redemption period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| So as soon as that redemption period was up, we go to move as quickly as we can to sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4175)|
| 1:09:42| All right. Thanks, Ben. Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| Any opposed? The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| On page 10, Resolution 904, express in support of Senate Bill 256 to extend the Tennessee Economic Council on Women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4189)|
| 1:10:01| Is there a motion? So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| Second. We have a motion and a second. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| Yes. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| I was a little concerned when this first was in the Senate Government Operations Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4211)|
| 1:10:21| and of the eight senators that serve on that body, two of the senators are females.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4221)|
| 1:10:29| And when the vote came regarding this bill, the two female senators voted against having this bill move forward out of committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4229)|
| 1:10:40| So the motion obviously failed in committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4240)|
| 1:10:45| So I reached out to Senator Mae Beaver's office today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| And, of course, they're not now in session until 5 o'clock tonight, Nashville time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4250)|
| 1:10:56| So I did not get a response back from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| So I contacted the chairman of that body, who is Senator Bell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| and his staff encouraged me to go to the video and watch actually the May 4th testimony before that committee and what the vote was taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4265)|
| 1:11:16| And apparently the senators are not overwhelmed with this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4276)|
| 1:11:27| They've been in business for 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| Apparently they've never issued any legislation to the state of Tennessee in that 16-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4290)|
| 1:11:39| Some of the senators were a little concerned that there's supposed to be a research institute, yet they only had one full-time researcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4299)|
| 1:11:49| And it was interesting, before they voted down the extension of the Economic Council on Women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4309)|
| 1:11:57| that they added an amendment to that bill that stated that the board members must attend 50 percent of the meetings within a six-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4317)|
| 1:12:10| So one would be left to guess that the board members don't even show up for the board meetings because they may not perceive that it's a valuable entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4330)|
| 1:12:21| So I guess I was kind of taken aback, because if this is a women's organization, and yet the women senators voted against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4341)|
| 1:12:32| So if you wanted to – so –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| Is it dead in committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| It's dead right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| However, what this was to do was to provide funding through June 30th of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4360)|
| 1:12:47| Since it failed at the Senate Government Operations Committee, it's still funded through June 30th of 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4367)|
| 1:12:56| So they basically have 15 more months of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| So they're still on the agenda then for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| But at this point, no one will go on record as to say why they're against funding a $300,000 entity at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4386)|
| 1:13:18| Commissioner Burleson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| John, did you have a chance to look at the websites that I sent you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| Some, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| So did you have a chance to look at the just incredible volume of research that the council has turned out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| And the senators acknowledged that there was a lot of research generated and then that some of the different governmental entities had used that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4411)|
| 1:13:42| But I still find it odd that the senators were against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| So I'm just – information practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| I find it odd that those two particular women would as well, but perhaps not maybe as odd as you would find it, knowing them myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4431)|
| 1:14:02| The Economic Council on Women, the reason they only have one researcher is because they're only funded to the tune of about $300,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4442)|
| 1:14:11| It's funded the least amount of any governmental entity in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| So they do the best with what they've got, and they turn out a remarkable amount of research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4456)|
| 1:14:23| The return on investment for Tennesseans is just incredible for the amount of work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4463)|
| 1:14:30| And the work that they do benefits not just women in our state, but everyone in our state, families, children, men, and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4470)|
| 1:14:41| They do a summit once a year that's attended by hundreds of women and men from across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4481)|
| 1:14:51| Madeline Rojero has been an honorary co-chair of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| She's spoken a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| I go every year that there's not something – it's always, unfortunately, the fourth Monday in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4497)|
| 1:15:05| So unless there's something on the agenda that I need to definitely be here for, I try to make that summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4505)|
| 1:15:14| It's always informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| I always bring back good information that is applicable to women's issues here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4515)|
| 1:15:25| And it's an organization that deserves to continue and not to wind down after the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4525)|
| 1:15:34| Women make up 51 percent of our state's population, and yet women in Tennessee still make 77 cents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4534)|
| 1:15:44| 70 to 77 cents per every dollar that a Tennessee man makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4544)|
| 1:15:51| And this being Women's History Month, when we're recognizing women and women's contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| it would be a shame, a real shame, to see this go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| They do provide – it's not an expensive investment, but the return on it is tremendous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4560)|
| 1:16:08| and it would be a real shame for it not to be supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4568)|
| 1:16:14| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| Just quickly, Amy, I mean, we get a lot of these things supporting different bills and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4575)|
| 1:16:23| and based on what information that Commissioner Schoonmaker just brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4583)|
| 1:16:30| it does concern me that two of the people that are closest to it didn't vote for it, but you said you knew them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4590)|
| 1:16:37| Why do you think they didn't support it, these two women?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4597)|
| 1:16:43| You know, I haven't had a chance to talk to May or to the other senator whose name totally escapes me right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4603)|
| 1:16:50| but I would like to talk to them, and the next time I head over to Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| I will be meeting with them to find out exactly what their hesitations were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| I think there is a general effort to kind of slash and burn through the state, through a lot of these committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4618)|
| 1:17:09| Another committee that I think very highly of, the Tennessee Human Rights Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4629)|
| 1:17:15| has been the number of people serving on that has been cut, I believe, in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4635)|
| 1:17:23| So it's happening to a lot of groups that the state has funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4643)|
| 1:17:29| The Tennessee, well, our own, you know, Epilepsy Foundation here in Knox County has had their funding cut by 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4649)|
| 1:17:38| But, no, I haven't had a chance to talk to May personally about it or, like I said, to the other senator whose name I can't remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4658)|
| 1:17:45| but I certainly do intend to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| But as I said, this is the group that receives the least amount of funding of any organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4668)|
| 1:17:55| and the work they do is incredibly valuable, especially for people who do things like grant writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4675)|
| 1:18:01| There's no other organization or group in the state doing the kind of research that the Tennessee Economic Council on Women does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4681)|
| 1:18:09| And the research that they generate provides information for grant writers that they can't find anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4689)|
| 1:18:18| So it's also valuable in that manner as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4698)|
| 1:18:24| Their new work hub website is available for everyone to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4704)|
| 1:18:31| It's absolutely incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| We found out through the research that they did that they presented two years ago on the cost of violence against women in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4714)|
| 1:18:44| that that's costing our state almost a billion dollars a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| And through that research, they've been able to work with local law enforcement in additional and enhanced training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4728)|
| 1:18:55| on how to handle domestic violence and other types of violence against women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4735)|
| 1:19:01| and have been able to print out materials that have been used to train law enforcement agencies across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4741)|
| 1:19:11| So these are all very important and very valuable resources and assets to the people of the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4751)|
| 1:19:19| and to 51 percent of the population at least of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4759)|
| 1:19:25| I don't know if any of you all remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| I had a colleague who was unhappy about my time spent at a summit that the Economic Council put on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4769)|
| 1:19:39| And the public response was swift and harsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4779)|
| 1:19:45| There was no question that the public in Knox County valued the work that the council did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4785)|
| 1:19:54| and was expecting us to continue our education and was encouraging participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4794)|
| 1:20:07| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| From what Commissioner Shoemaker said a while ago, it's already dead for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| So whatever we do is a moot point anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| Not exactly because it can be brought back at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| No, it's not a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| It can indeed be brought back at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| Well, from what he's saying, I don't read it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| So, you know, I think we're just shooting a dead horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4831)|
| 1:20:36| If it's going to come up again next year, then we vote on it again next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4836)|
| 1:20:41| Commissioner, since you've already spoken at once, I'm going to go to Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4841)|
| 1:20:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4845)|
| 1:20:51| I would hate to think that, you know, as I look at it, I think we need to vote on it on its merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4851)|
| 1:20:58| Commissioner Shoemaker, I appreciate the research you've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| but I don't think it's a valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| I mean, in terms of if a woman voted or didn't vote for it, that's not of concern to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4866)|
| 1:21:13| Is this a valid thing for us to support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| I don't, you know, the senators have their own reasons, but they're independent senators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4876)|
| 1:21:23| They're not female senators or male senators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| They chose not to support it for whatever reasons they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| I mean, I think we as a body need to consider the merits of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4891)|
| 1:21:36| look at the websites that Commissioner Burroughs put forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| consider your points in that only one full-time staff, and, you know, question that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4901)|
| 1:21:48| question what the concerns were, but not the fact that I guess I'll say it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4908)|
| 1:22:02| In terms of my votes, I don't vote as the black commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4922)|
| 1:22:08| I don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| So I don't think Commissioner Burroughs votes as the female commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4930)|
| 1:22:16| So if I vote something that may upset the African-American community within Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4936)|
| 1:22:22| I'll have to answer those questions, but I'm voting on where I feel the issue should go or should not go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4942)|
| 1:22:29| And I'm sure these two senators are the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| They have their reasons, and it will be good to get those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| but I don't think that's really germane to what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| We're talking about do we want to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| This is a counselor from what I've looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4962)|
| 1:22:46| They do good research, and they do good research in terms of allowing any entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| to be able to pull those numbers and plop them into a document, into a RFP or RFQ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4971)|
| 1:22:58| or plopping into a white paper or something to generate additional, to get funding, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4978)|
| 1:23:04| you know, it's kind of an organization that serves, you know, certain constituency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4984)|
| 1:23:12| Let's not get politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| I'm smelling politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| I don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| If the issue, it's not a dead issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| If the issue can come up, I think the mayor said last week, it could potentially come up and get funded or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| At any point, it's not dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| It's not dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| It's not like the TennCare thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| That's not where this thing is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| So, again, let's vote it up or vote it down, but not on what someone in Nashville has voted for or hadn't voted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5015)|
| 1:23:44| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| I was just going to add that the other senator was Janice Boling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| Janice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| Did anyone get a chance to see the March 4th video of what actually happened at the committee meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5033)|
| 1:24:01| How many members are on the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| There's eight members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5043)|
| 1:24:04| Okay, so it was unanimously voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| No, there was four noes, the chairman passed, and then there were three yeses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5047)|
| 1:24:13| So it wasn't just the two women voting against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| No, I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| All right, we have a motion to support on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5065)|
| 1:24:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| Who are the noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| Brown and Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5076)|
| 1:24:40| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| I'd just like to go on record and say my no vote is not against the work that they have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5084)|
| 1:24:49| They do good work, but I'm looking at the thing in practicality and what has happened to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5089)|
| 1:24:54| and that's why I voted the way I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5097)|
| 1:24:58| I guess I'll make a statement in regards to sending stuff to the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| I think if a commissioner, and I've always said this, I can't convince anybody it's a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| but if you're against a bill that this legislature is proposing or passing or supporting a bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5105)|
| 1:25:11| draft a letter to them and see what other commissioners want to put their name on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| We're just placing ourselves in positions we don't need to be placing ourselves as a body on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| On page 11, ordinances on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| amending Knox County Code Chapter 12, Article 2, entitled Peddlers and Solicitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| to amend Section 12-29, License Procedure, to give the county clerk the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5131)|
| 1:25:36| to not issue a license to an applicant if there are any outstanding warrants against the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5136)|
| 1:25:42| or if the applicant has been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude within the past 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5142)|
| 1:25:48| to revise portions of the procedure of obtaining a license in Section 12-29| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| and to amend Section 12-33 to authorize the county clerk to suspend or revoke a license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5153)|
| 1:25:59| if it is discovered that there is an outstanding warrant against a license holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| or a license holder has been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude within the past 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5163)|
| 1:26:09| This is ordinance numbers 0-97-5-101, adopted July 28, 1997,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5169)|
| 1:26:16| and 0-12-10-101, adopted November 19, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| This is on first reading 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| I'll make a motion to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5187)|
| 1:26:28| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| Were we able to get some information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| I didn't see anything come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| Well, I think the way we were stumped up was the definition of moral turpitude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5196)|
| 1:26:43| and so I think that in my discussion with Foster it was that it really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5203)|
| 1:26:50| moral turpitude talks about in the federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| Come up, Foster, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| I believe in the federal statute that definition runs along the lines of the top one FBI crimes that we spoke of earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5215)|
| 1:27:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| Foster Arnett, Knox County Clerk, 300 Main Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| The definition of moral turpitude is a legal concept in the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5230)|
| 1:27:15| and some other countries that refers to conduct that is considered contrary to community standards of justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5235)|
| 1:27:22| honesty, or good morals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| This term appears in the U.S. immigration law beginning in the 19th century,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| and I've got about 16 pages here that goes over everything that moral turpitude covers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| Well, it says that a community deems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5257)|
| 1:27:44| I guess my concern with this is, and I'm sure the sheriff can comment on get the numbers right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5264)|
| 1:27:52| but there's a lot of people that are going to be coming, going to be reintroduced into our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5272)|
| 1:28:04| that did not suffer from, you know, did not commit violent crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| I don't know, drug or whatever, trafficking, not a violent crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| or not a crime that will give us calls for them knocking on someone's door in terms of they've assaulted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5292)|
| 1:28:24| or they've had a weapon or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| That's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| And so after paying their price, after going, you know, being incarcerated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5308)|
| 1:28:35| after whatever, you know, probationary period is out there, I guess I would hate to tack on another 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5315)|
| 1:28:44| And, you know, I think our original thing was trying to get at, you know, a rapist or a murderer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5324)|
| 1:28:51| knocking on someone's door or going door to door sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| So this 10 years for some crimes, and so we try to get to that answer of what moral turpitude means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5334)|
| 1:29:04| would seem a little harsh to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| You know, if they're violent crimes, crimes involving weapons, I could definitely see that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5347)|
| 1:29:16| But you'll, we're just kind of, and again, this isn't a beer or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5356)|
| 1:29:25| we're not empowering them to go out and sell alcohol or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| So that 10-year term for as a blanket concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| If it listed, let me ask you this, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| If it listed, and I may have missed one, and I apologize if I do, murder, rape, burglary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5377)|
| 1:29:42| aggravated assault, manslaughter, armed something or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5382)|
| 1:29:49| I've got the list in front of me, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| It goes on to talk about fraud, arson, blackmail, burglary, embezzlement, extortion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| false pretenses, forgery, fraud, larceny, grand or petty, malicious destruction of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| knowingly receiving stolen goods, robbery, theft, transportation of stolen property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| bribery, counterfeiting, fraud against revenue or other government functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| mail fraud, perjury, harboring a fugitive from justice, tax evasion, assault,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5412)|
| 1:30:17| and obviously mayhem, murder, pandering, prostitution, rape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5417)|
| 1:30:21| And as long as I'm the clerk, I'm just, I'm not going to give somebody who's been convicted of these crimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5421)|
| 1:30:31| a pass to go knock on, you know, my grandmother's door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| No one's asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5437)|
| 1:30:38| If we can come up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| We're talking about 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5441)|
| 1:30:42| We're not, so again, you can feel the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| So after 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| You're going to call murder and fraud or murder and perjury the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5444)|
| 1:30:50| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5450)|
| 1:30:51| That's what Moral Interpretation says, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| That's what we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| So that's exactly what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| We're talking about perjury equated with murder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5457)|
| 1:31:03| And that's, I'm just saying, so I think Brad was on the right track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| We can get an inclusive list of things that concern us, and we can pull from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5467)|
| 1:31:13| I'll be fine to pull from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| There are some things that make our eyes bug out, and if our eyes bug out, add it to the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5474)|
| 1:31:20| But, you know, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| Well, if I may, Commissioner, I agree with Chairman Anders, obviously, being a police lieutenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5482)|
| 1:31:29| and I spent 16 years at the police department, and I talked to Sheriff Jones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| and to our chief of police last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| And I think you're on the right track when you talk about FBI Part 1 crimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| murder, rape, robbery, armed robbery, like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| I agree with you on that, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| But, you know, we're talking about, as I understand it, the laws regarding moral turpitude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5507)|
| 1:31:55| and that's what this says right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| And as long as it says that, it doesn't say there's any statute that runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| Correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Law Director, but as a Knox County clerk, I'm not going to give somebody a pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5524)|
| 1:32:12| that's been in prison for first-degree murder to go knock on somebody's door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| I don't care if it's been 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| Hey, man, no one here has said anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| Again, you're talking apples and oranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| Moral turpitude and first-degree murder are miles and miles apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| But according to this, they fall into the same category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| Okay, it's an umbrella is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| It's moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| So what I'm saying, let's take out moral turpitude and put in Class I felonies or list what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5555)|
| 1:32:44| There's a lot of them, but it's a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| We'll have to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| I think it would be wise for the commissioners to review what the top-one crimes are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| because the top-one A, yeah, those are pretty easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| The top-one B, it goes into the fraud, and it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| So I think it would be wise for the commissioners to look at top-one crimes and maybe list them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5579)|
| 1:33:09| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| Citizens of this county elected J.J. to uphold the law, make all the arrests and all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5593)|
| 1:33:21| They also elected Foster to do his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| We trust J.J. to do his job, and we trust Foster to do his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5605)|
| 1:33:32| And if he has a list that says this is what it is, then that's what it's got to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| And I applaud him for standing up for what his list says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| Now, it may be that there might be something in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5621)|
| 1:33:48| and this is a legislative body that would have to make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| But it's hard to draw a line in the middle when you're talking about crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5632)|
| 1:34:02| It's just like sin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| There's no such thing as big sins and little sins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| So we need to be careful about what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| We have the responsibility of protecting those citizens just as much as J.J. and his troops do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5653)|
| 1:34:20| And David Roush and his troops do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| I'm sorry, Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| Yeah, as I look into this, one thing to keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5670)|
| 1:34:36| the majority of the people that are going to be answering those doors are going to be in the middle of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5676)|
| 1:34:41| and they're going to be senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| It's not going to be me or you going to that door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| yeah, I've got my clock back in the bedroom, I can bring it with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| But my mom, your mom, dad, whoever, is not going to be so self-assured of themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5690)|
| 1:34:59| So we know where you keep your glock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| And that concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| The other thing to remember, and I don't, obviously, a murderer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| somebody like that, we're not going to allow them to get some sort of permit to come knock on people's doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5707)|
| 1:35:12| But keep in mind, I think one of the biggest crimes that we read about all the time in this town or other towns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5712)|
| 1:35:19| is that con men that come and scam our seniors for various things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5719)|
| 1:35:26| Now, they didn't kill anybody, but, you know, taking their life savings or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| conning them out of it, to me, is extremely serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| And I don't think we should take this any less that some of these people that have been caught doing various crimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5736)|
| 1:35:44| may have not been caught doing other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| So I have no problem with the tenures, personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5746)|
| 1:35:53| All right, what we have before us is a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| Just rereading the caption, this is only peddlers and solicitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5760)|
| 1:36:10| And it's broken down into this is to deny the application for only two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5770)|
| 1:36:22| One reason the applicant would be denied is because of an outstanding warrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5782)|
| 1:36:29| And we haven't said the first word about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| We've only talked about the best predictor of future occurrences, and that's what you've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5793)|
| 1:36:43| Now, we've had some discussion about whether or not murder is equivalent to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5803)|
| 1:36:53| and the one word I'll pick out is fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5813)|
| 1:36:59| What if the person committed the crime of murder and it was an act of passion, it was still murder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| We didn't discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| We talked about the peddler or solicitor standing on someone's front porch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5825)|
| 1:37:14| You have no place to go find them again because they're in a vehicle or they're on foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5834)|
| 1:37:20| And if we want to talk about fraud, that would be the perfect instance to begin to commit the fraud again in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5840)|
| 1:37:31| So if I get a free pass here to say the best predictor of the future is to look at what you've done in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5851)|
| 1:37:41| then I would think that moral turpitude is a good standard to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5861)|
| 1:37:47| when we're only talking about this one class of license, and that's peddlers and solicitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5867)|
| 1:37:54| So I'll support this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5874)|
| 1:37:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5884)|

| 1:38:10| One nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5890)|
| 1:38:11| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5891)|
| 1:38:12| That will be the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5892)|
| 1:38:13| I think we'll have another reading next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5893)|
| 1:38:14| Is that correct, Laura?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5897)|

| 1:38:40| Is that still clear with everybody's schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| So we'll set that meeting for that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5923)|

| 1:38:48| If you'll make sure you notify the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| I need a motion and a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| Oh, I need a motion and a vote to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=5933)|

| 1:45:03| I'm Mark Shipley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6303)|
| 1:45:05| I'm a community development director for the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| I'm not actually opposed to this request necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| I'm really just here to indicate to you all that, as you know, probably this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6311)|
| 1:45:19| is in the town's urban growth boundary that was adopted several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6319)|
| 1:45:26| And consequently, the parcel was included when we updated our comprehensive land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6326)|
| 1:45:32| plan back in December of 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6332)|
| 1:45:37| We had a lot of we spent several months gathering public input and had a lot of public involvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6337)|
| 1:45:44| on where they saw the town's future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| The outlet drive corridor, which this parcel is on the east end or west end of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6348)|
| 1:45:55| was actually a sub area in our comprehensive land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6355)|
| 1:46:00| Based on the feedback that we received when we updated the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6360)|
| 1:46:05| this area was shown as a preferred location for high-end office and light industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6365)|
| 1:46:12| to be like employment providers for the surrounding commercial developments along Parkside Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6372)|
| 1:46:20| Lovell Road, Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| So I really was just kind of bringing to the commission's attention that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6383)|
| 1:46:29| we do have a comprehensive land use plan that does affect some parcels that are outside of the town's boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6389)|
| 1:46:36| I have reached out to the MPC staff, Mike Rousseau, and he's a very good friend of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6396)|
| 1:46:42| and I certainly understand the MPC's recommendation on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6402)|
| 1:46:46| I understand the property to the east is already zoned for 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6406)|
| 1:46:53| I'm really just here, you know, to convey that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| we hope to work with MPC staff in the future on those parcels that are in our urban growth boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6418)|
| 1:47:04| and, you know, move forward from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| Thank you, sir. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| Yes, I just wanted to thank the town of Farragut for coming down here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6430)|
| 1:47:15| And what I'd like is, Mr. Seymour, that your client would get with Mr. Shipley and Mr. David Smoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6435)|
| 1:47:24| who's the town administrator for the town of Farragut, and kind of give them the overview of what your project is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6444)|
| 1:47:30| And now that I'm aware of what the town of Farragut's needs are as far as rezonings that are adjacent to the town border,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6450)|
| 1:47:38| I'll be a little bit more closer to keep an eye on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6458)|
| 1:47:41| as well as I hope that the MPC will also give you warning when a rezoning comes before them when it borders the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6461)|
| 1:47:52| I know Mr. Shipley and Mr. Smoke well, so, yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| We meet at least once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| Yeah, we'll be happy to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6482)|
| 1:48:03| All right, we have a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| Who seconded that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6487)|

| 1:48:57| I think that would probably cause a coronary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6537)|

| 1:50:15| Is there any opposition? I didn't ask for opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6615)|

| 1:51:51| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| Do you want to say anything, Scott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| Yeah. When I made the original application to MPC, I requested OB zoning on a portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| and then PR zoning for the remainder of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| And I would request that be approved on the OB side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6723)|
| 1:52:10| I agreed to the PR 1-6 on the one section that fronts closer down to Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6730)|
| 1:52:17| but the OB zoning gives a lot more flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| I've been contacted by assisted living facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| I've been contacted by a hospital group as well as for a private school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6742)|
| 1:52:29| and the OB zoning allows for a lot more flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| I don't have a specific use at this time, but all the indicators are right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| that the use that's being proposed is going to be for more of a office-type medical or slash school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6756)|
| 1:52:45| which would require the OB zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| Scott, I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| Yeah, I'm sorry. I apologize. And thanks again for moving me down on agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| I was scrambling to get here as fast as I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6774)|

| 1:53:02| Okay. Right now we're on the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| Does that affect the discussion on the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| I believe you'd have to approve MDR 0-0 in order to allow the OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6788)|
| 1:53:15| Was that brought before the MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| Yes, it was, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6798)|
| 1:53:19| And turned down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| Turned down by staff or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| It was actually considered by the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| and the commission ultimately decided to go PR for the entire site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6807)|
| 1:53:32| The sector plan amendment was approved, and Dave understands this a lot better than I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6812)|
| 1:53:38| but the sector plan amendment went from low-density residential to medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6818)|
| 1:53:44| which I think OB is permitted in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6824)|
| 1:53:50| Will you look at the caption there on the first zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| It says MDR 0, medium-density residential, slash office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| That was the applicant's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| The actual motion made by Commissioner Clancy was MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6838)|
| 1:54:03| I got you. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| What good would it do us to zone this MDR and MDR slash 0 or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6852)|
| 1:54:21| if we get to the next one and the recommendation from Planning Commission is 100% PR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6861)|
| 1:54:31| Right. That's what we're trying to avoid before we make the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6871)|
| 1:54:34| What was the reasoning for the denial on the 0?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| I think there was considerable discussion about the slope of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| I think there was actually a little bit of disagreement regarding the intensity of the slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6883)|
| 1:54:49| but the other factor I believe that was discussed was a little bit of puzzlement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6889)|
| 1:54:56| as to why OB zoning would be requested for actually the south portion of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6896)|
| 1:55:04| as you're going up the ridge rather than down closer to Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6904)|
| 1:55:11| I can attempt to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| If you look at where D1 Sports is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| there's a stub out road that comes straight across from Burrell Camp Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| which is where the new FedEx massive facility is going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| I have agreement with the D1 folks to continue that road up to that portion of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6921)|
| 1:55:28| and D1 is obviously a commercial enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| There's a hospital connected to that, a medical center connected to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6931)|
| 1:55:35| and this would be a continuation of that road going up next to D1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| which is a commercial piece of property, which would make a continuation of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| straight across from Burrell Camp Boulevard and across from FedEx.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6944)|
| 1:55:54| So this is right beside D1 where it goes up the hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| That's correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6957)|
| 1:56:02| And as I understand that there's a red light being proposed for that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6962)|
| 1:56:07| which would make that a lighted intersection there at Burrell Camp Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6967)|
| 1:56:11| which would make a lighted intersection going into that portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6971)|
| 1:56:15| So if there's a higher traffic calculation there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| it made more sense for the OB to be on that western portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6978)|
| 1:56:24| Would it be, Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6984)|
| 1:56:26| I just want to be sure where we're voting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| Are we going to vote to change it, and then 30 seconds later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| we're going to vote to change it to something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| Or do we need to make a substitute motion and put it in 15 SP SPR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=6995)|
| 1:56:44| Well, I made the motion, and the motion was per MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7004)|
| 1:56:49| which does not have the O in it, correct, Dave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| I also did agree at the MPC meeting to dedicate 20 acres of the slope area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7014)|
| 1:57:00| to maintain as a slope-protected area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7020)|
| 1:57:03| and as a concession to getting the OB zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7023)|
| 1:57:08| and I would dedicate 20 acres of slope-protected area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| and I would also allow for a greenway access easement across the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7031)|
| 1:57:15| which is what the MP staff folks wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| Mr. Hill, do you mind to read in what the staff recommendation is for the 2D15 SP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7040)|
| 1:57:26| the deny and the recommended, just the dark letters in the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| The staff recommendation was to deny the MDRO land use classification on the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7051)|
| 1:57:39| and to recommend approval of PR at three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7059)|
| 1:57:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7064)|
| 1:57:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| But in the bottom it's approve up to six dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7068)|
| 1:57:52| Isn't that conflicting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| The staff recommendation, but evidently the MPC moved it from three and a half to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7074)|
| 1:58:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7082)|
| 1:58:03| Is that right, Dave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7085)|
| 1:58:06| Let's say, I'm going to give you an example because I'm kind of on the fencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7086)|
| 1:58:11| If we put the O onto the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7091)|
| 1:58:17| is there a use on review before he can break the ground on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7097)|
| 1:58:21| or does he have carte blanche on the OB area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7101)|
| 1:58:25| I think just so you have a sense of scale, you have to look at the next case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7105)|
| 1:58:31| and there is a rezoning map that shows a line of division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7111)|
| 1:58:38| between the parcels that the applicant is asking to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| So you'd end up with about 21 acres, a little more than that, of PR zoning and 56 acres of OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7122)|
| 1:58:50| For the PR, you would have use on review and the commission would review the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7130)|
| 1:58:57| For OB, you would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| As long as you're under 24 units per acre, OB does not require use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7140)|
| 1:59:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| What was the reason for the staff recommendation to deny the O,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7152)|
| 1:59:17| and part of that 56 acres he's requesting O, 20 of that is in the restricted area, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7157)|
| 1:59:31| During the planning commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| we did our slope density analysis that we typically add into the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7174)|
| 1:59:38| You can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| We came up with about 60 acres that was sloped more than 15%, which led to our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7180)|
| 1:59:49| The applicant has said that he believes that only about 30 are severely sloped or more than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7189)|
| 1:59:56| So I think that that led to a little bit of confusion in terms of what's correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7196)|
| 2:00:02| the maps that are used by KGIS or the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7202)|
| 2:00:06| So what is a slope-protected area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7206)|
| 2:00:11| I think the way that the commission, the MPC was thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7211)|
| 2:00:16| was we will work that out once we get to the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7216)|
| 2:00:21| So the actual terminology, if you look in the minutes, used by the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7221)|
| 2:00:27| was dedicating conservation easement and then the ability to have a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7227)|
| 2:00:34| So I think that was, as a matter of fact, Commissioner Clancy from MPC was quoted as saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7234)|
| 2:00:42| if he didn't see that in the site plan, he wouldn't vote for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7242)|
| 2:00:47| And it wasn't in the site plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| We don't know yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7249)|
| 2:00:50| We haven't seen it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7250)|
| 2:00:53| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7253)|
| 2:00:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7254)|
| 2:00:55| Go ahead, Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7255)|
| 2:00:56| I'm looking at this map here that's showing the slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7256)|
| 2:00:59| and MPC is saying that how many acres of this are in the slope protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| 50-plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7263)|
| 2:01:06| 25%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7266)|
| 2:01:07| 50-plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7267)|
| 2:01:08| Again, acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7268)|
| 2:01:13| One of the staff reports actually has the slope density analysis conducted by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7273)|
| 2:01:18| It's actually the rezoning case, 1D15RZ, about halfway through the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7278)|
| 2:01:25| So we came to the conclusion using the actual topographic maps generated by aerial photographs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7285)|
| 2:01:36| we came up with 27 acres, 27.41, between 15 and 25% slope, 14 acres at 25 to 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7296)|
| 2:01:48| and then nearly five acres at greater than 40% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7308)|
| 2:01:53| So if, you know, you add those three together, it's fairly close to 60 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7313)|
| 2:01:59| And I believe that Mr. Davis felt that only 30 of it was over 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7319)|
| 2:02:05| And quite frankly, I don't recall that we've been challenged like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7325)|
| 2:02:12| and our typical response would be if we need to, you know, go back and settle this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7332)|
| 2:02:19| we would probably want to sit down with the engineer and find out what data they were using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7339)|
| 2:02:26| and try to figure out what the discrepancy would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| I don't know if you all have the color map that they derived this from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7350)|
| 2:02:35| but this color map, if you can see this area here, I know it's a long ways for you to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7355)|
| 2:02:41| but all the green is 0 to 15%, and all this is green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7361)|
| 2:02:48| So how you can derive 60% of that, and Folger McAdoo did the slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7368)|
| 2:02:53| to come up with the 20-plus acres that was in what they would call the slope-protected area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7373)|
| 2:03:00| But if you look at the color map provided by MPC, it's not 60 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7380)|
| 2:03:05| That would be almost the entire piece of property, and this is vastly green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7385)|
| 2:03:10| And Folger McAdoo did the engineering firm did the analysis on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7390)|
| 2:03:14| and that's why I agreed to dedicate 20 acres to the slope-protected area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7394)|
| 2:03:19| just to leave a buffer around there and protect those slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7399)|
| 2:03:23| to avoid any confusion or controversy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7403)|
| 2:03:27| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7407)|
| 2:03:30| Come back to me. I'm thinking. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| You're doing math in public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7415)|
| 2:03:37| Could I add just one thing because I don't want to misrepresent how we use the slope density analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7417)|
| 2:03:43| The 15% to 25% slope category does not necessarily put that in a slope-protected area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7423)|
| 2:03:49| but what it does do is there is a recommended density that's lower than the 5 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7429)|
| 2:03:58| that would normally be considered for LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7438)|
| 2:04:02| So in every case under LDR, 15% to 25% slope would have a recommended density of 2 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7442)|
| 2:04:12| That wouldn't mean that it couldn't be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7452)|
| 2:04:16| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7456)|
| 2:04:19| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7459)|
| 2:04:20| I'm glad you brought that up, Dave, because we spent over a year working on a slope protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7460)|
| 2:04:28| and it's been brought to our attention on a couple of occasions it's not written in blood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7468)|
| 2:04:33| Well, we sweat a lot of blood when we're making that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7473)|
| 2:04:36| and whenever I vote for something, I vote for what's in that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7476)|
| 2:04:40| Now, and I know how Mark Donaldson did it, and I do not agree with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7480)|
| 2:04:46| where you take 50% slope and put it in there with your 10% slope and average it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7486)|
| 2:04:52| That dog don't hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7492)|
| 2:04:54| If you've got over 40%, then you've got to have 2 acres to a unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7494)|
| 2:05:04| And as you mentioned, from 15 to 25, you've got 2 to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7504)|
| 2:05:10| So you cannot lump a whole parcel of X number of acres, 50, 60, whatever this happens to be totally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7510)|
| 2:05:20| and say we're going to do it, they recommended 6 in the next item coming up on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7520)|
| 2:05:26| We've got to get down to taking how much is in the less than 15, that can be 1 to 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7526)|
| 2:05:33| How much is in the 15 to 25, that can be 1 to 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7533)|
| 2:05:39| How much is over 25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7539)|
| 2:05:41| It's got to be 2 acres to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7541)|
| 2:05:44| Then you add those figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| You don't take all of the acres together and pick an average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7545)|
| 2:05:51| That's not the way you do proper planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7551)|
| 2:05:56| Commissioner, roll on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7556)|
| 2:06:04| I'm going to make a substitute motion that we add the O, make it MDR slash O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7564)|
| 2:06:13| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7573)|
| 2:06:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7574)|
| 2:06:15| Well, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7575)|
| 2:06:17| Go ahead, Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7577)|
| 2:06:18| This is on the second plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7578)|
| 2:06:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7580)|
| 2:06:22| This is one of those situations where you would need to initiate a second plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7582)|
| 2:06:27| and it would need to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7587)|
| 2:06:29| They would need to review it and send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7589)|
| 2:06:32| MPC already approved a second plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| If we change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7595)|
| 2:06:36| No, they didn't approve the O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7596)|
| 2:06:37| They didn't approve the O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7597)|
| 2:06:38| If we change it, send it back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| If they want to make any modification to what MPC sent to the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| it needs to go back to MPC for their review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7605)|
| 2:06:49| In all due respect, I went through that once before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7609)|
| 2:06:51| and I have a lot of respect for your opinion as an attorney, but that is not state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7611)|
| 2:06:55| That is someone's opinion somewhere that came up, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| I don't know where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| But the fact that you all have the elected legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7621)|
| 2:07:05| you have the power of which to override and or vote for anything you desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7625)|
| 2:07:11| It does not necessitate going back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7631)|
| 2:07:16| They do have the authority to initiate a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| However, there's a process for the county commission to initiate that sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| and the process includes a return to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7643)|
| 2:07:26| They have already approved a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| Thus, if they did not approve the sector plan amendment, you would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7648)|
| 2:07:32| But by approving a sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7652)|
| 2:07:34| that opened the door for this body to make a change to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7654)|
| 2:07:40| And I would beg to differ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| You're obviously much more versed in this than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7662)|
| 2:07:44| But once MPC, and I'll ask the law director to opine there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7664)|
| 2:07:49| once MPC opened that door, it gives you all, this legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7669)|
| 2:07:54| to make a change to the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| If MPC had denied it outright, it would have to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7676)|
| 2:08:00| That's not my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| I don't agree either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| Can you, I'm pretty sure where they're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| Can you research that a little bit, Todd or Dave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7688)|
| 2:08:11| I've been involved in this a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7691)|
| 2:08:12| and I was part of why this all got screwed around and changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7692)|
| 2:08:16| when I was on the other side of the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7696)|
| 2:08:19| I'm glad you finally admitted that, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| Daniel is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7703)|
| 2:08:24| It's very cumbersome, but that's what the legislature did in a hurry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7704)|
| 2:08:28| based on what happened several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| So Daniel's opinion is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7710)|
| 2:08:33| Well, I will stand corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| And I will go back, and if I find something contrary to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7716)|
| 2:08:40| I'll bring it before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7720)|
| 2:08:43| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| Mr. Hill, I just have a question regarding the next on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7725)|
| 2:08:50| The MPC commissioners approved six units per acre for the entire tract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7730)|
| 2:08:56| At the R, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7736)|
| 2:08:57| Okay, so at 77 and change units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7737)|
| 2:09:00| they could have like 460 units on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7740)|
| 2:09:04| If approved at six units, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7747)|
| 2:09:08| If I'm required to go back to MPC, I don't have the time, energy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7748)|
| 2:09:12| or the financial resources to continue this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7752)|
| 2:09:15| then I would respectfully request of this body to approve as per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7755)|
| 2:09:24| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7764)|
| 2:09:26| Okay, we've got a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7766)|
| 2:09:27| So it sounds like he may need to drop his substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| As we look at further discussion, we talked about the reason they turned it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7772)|
| 2:09:40| And they talked about what Mr. Brown was talking about in regards to the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7780)|
| 2:09:45| But they went sideways with the slope recommendations on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7785)|
| 2:09:49| And so I can't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7789)|
| 2:09:52| I just want to think that the commissioners were confused at some point in the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7792)|
| 2:09:58| because you went way beyond the zoning for the slope, but you won't allow OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7798)|
| 2:10:06| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7806)|
| 2:10:08| You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7808)|
| 2:10:09| But I think that and I agree with the thought of what I think the commissioners were thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7809)|
| 2:10:17| And that is that if you have PR, you can zone at a high density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7817)|
| 2:10:24| and zone sensitively with the landform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7824)|
| 2:10:27| It's not like you can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7827)|
| 2:10:30| And so the idea that you can review a site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| and see if some of the more steeply areas have been left undisturbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7834)|
| 2:10:39| then that's preferable to just saying six units to the acre and no more review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7839)|
| 2:10:46| So I think that's what the commission was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| What if we added the O in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7849)|
| 2:10:53| and went back as the commissioners and petitioned for the O to be added back in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7853)|
| 2:10:58| and then approved the zoning at one to six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| could he come back with a site plan for the O| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| if he decides that he's wanting to put some office or senior assisted living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7863)|
| 2:11:07| or something like that up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7867)|
| 2:11:10| For PR, I don't believe office uses are permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7870)|
| 2:11:14| Let me check very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| But if the sector plan has the O in it, but he only has PR down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7876)|
| 2:11:23| he still gets his zoning at one to six, but if something changes his mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7883)|
| 2:11:27| or something he changes his mind in the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| He could reapply to rezone a portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7889)|
| 2:11:32| And he wouldn't have to go through the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7894)|
| 2:11:35| Because the O is on there, but he's still got PR on the whole track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7895)|
| 2:11:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7898)|
| 2:11:39| Well, the PR, Dave, you can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7899)|
| 2:11:43| allows one acre for each five of commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7903)|
| 2:11:49| Now, that could be possibly swapped for OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7909)|
| 2:11:54| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7914)|
| 2:11:55| But it's one to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7915)|
| 2:11:56| That's what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7916)|
| 2:11:58| But here's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| It seems to me that we're operating under different rules than what the NPC does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7920)|
| 2:12:06| If we're going to have a slope protection plan, I'm going to play Tony Norman for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7926)|
| 2:12:10| if we're going to have a slope protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7930)|
| 2:12:13| then we need to abide by the slope protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7933)|
| 2:12:17| And if you figure these down, if it has to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| and we've got to send somebody to go out and measure this whole piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7940)|
| 2:12:23| or let them redo it and tell us how many acres in each category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7943)|
| 2:12:27| we add that up based on the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| and we cannot authorize any more units on the property than what that says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7949)|
| 2:12:35| That's what we'd be doing illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7955)|
| 2:12:39| But if it's OB, you wouldn't have that many units on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7959)|
| 2:12:41| and it may be 42 residential senior assisted living area that houses 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7961)|
| 2:12:48| Well, that's a way of getting around zoning numbers sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7968)|
| 2:12:53| and I don't like that idea either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| Let's be up front with what you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7976)|
| 2:13:00| Everybody knows what cards you're playing with, and do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7980)|
| 2:13:05| But if we go ahead and rezone or change this sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7985)|
| 2:13:10| and then two minutes later go down here and approve this sixth to the acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7990)|
| 2:13:15| and change it all to PR, then this last 20 minutes has been wasted up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=7995)|
| 2:13:22| That's my fault, and Commissioner Brown, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8002)|
| 2:13:27| It is a little confusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| and I apologize for going through that process with you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8008)|
| 2:13:31| and taking up your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8011)|
| 2:13:32| I should have accepted MPC's recommendation and moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8012)|
| 2:13:37| With the calls I'm getting and the type of use that is possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8017)|
| 2:13:42| I can come back and have more specific use and go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8022)|
| 2:13:46| If I say I have an office building or a hospital or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8026)|
| 2:13:49| I'll go back through that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| and I apologize for muddying the water and making it unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8031)|
| 2:13:54| So I would be agreeable to MPC's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8034)|
| 2:13:57| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8039)|
| 2:14:00| I kind of thought the purpose of the ridgetop slope protection was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8040)|
| 2:14:04| to protect the ridgetops and slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| and concentrate the development on the flatter, more usable land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8046)|
| 2:14:10| It is, but you can't take something you don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8050)|
| 2:14:14| and transfer it down to a level spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8054)|
| 2:14:19| He doesn't calculate that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| If you've got 20 acres here that's over 25%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8061)|
| 2:14:30| you only have 10 units that you can transfer down there, not 100,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8070)|
| 2:14:37| which we would have if you took the 5 to the acre on 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8077)|
| 2:14:41| You don't have that on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8081)|
| 2:14:42| You're transferring something you don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8082)|
| 2:14:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8085)|
| 2:14:46| But I thought that was if you were going to put it on the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| May I pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8089)|
| 2:14:50| You can't win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| Commissioner Rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8092)|
| 2:14:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8094)|
| 2:14:55| Everybody sit back, and as Amy asked us early in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8095)|
| 2:14:59| We need to center, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8099)|
| 2:15:00| Take a deep breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8100)|
| 2:15:01| Take a deep breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8101)|
| 2:15:05| I'm not speaking to this particular item that's before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8105)|
| 2:15:10| or these two items that we're looking at addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8110)|
| 2:15:15| I'm going to speak for just a second from my own personal opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8115)|
| 2:15:19| about the process that we're looking at right at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| and it's not you, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8122)|
| 2:15:25| It's the process by which I get ready to come to the zoning meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8125)|
| 2:15:31| and I read the zonings and I look at my email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8131)|
| 2:15:36| and I find things that people disagree with means I should study more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8136)|
| 2:15:41| Or I look at something that may be contentious and I go visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8141)|
| 2:15:46| These particular things that are before us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8146)|
| 2:15:49| there hasn't been any real opposition to anything until we get to this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8149)|
| 2:15:56| and I'm being asked to do something that I don't think is being recommended to me by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8156)|
| 2:16:04| and I have to give the people at MPC, staff, or commissioners, my Becky Longmire or my Laura Cole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8164)|
| 2:16:14| the benefit of the doubt and that by majority vote it comes to us recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8174)|
| 2:16:20| and that's what we're going to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8180)|
| 2:16:23| And the conversation about then changing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| or how do we go about amending it or getting it back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8186)|
| 2:16:31| since I've not studied this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| since I think we're at odds about what's taking place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8194)|
| 2:16:40| whether it be slope or concentration or it could be this or it could be that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8200)|
| 2:16:45| which ones get reviewed and which ones you then have the use to go do whatever you want to on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8205)|
| 2:16:54| If this stays before us in some form other than as recommended by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8214)|
| 2:16:59| I think I'll have to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8219)|
| 2:17:02| For that basic reason is that I'm not full enough informed about whether it's best or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8222)|
| 2:17:10| It could be the best thing since sliced bread,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| but this 20-minute discussion here is just bringing more uncertainty into the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8233)|
| 2:17:20| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8240)|
| 2:17:21| Mr. Olmey, Commissioner Olmey, I have no objection to you withdrawing your substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8241)|
| 2:17:26| on the staff recommendation, our MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| Commissioner Olmey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| Yeah, I'll pull my substitute motion because it's not worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8251)|
| 2:17:36| It would be beneficial to go backwards and forwards on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8256)|
| 2:17:39| I just have one little question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8259)|
| 2:17:40| Are we voting or looking at a sector plan change in this vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8260)|
| 2:17:44| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8264)|
| 2:17:45| You're changing the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| That's the first vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| The first vote is a sector plan change based on MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8269)|
| 2:17:52| And you're recommending a sector plan change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8272)|
| 2:17:55| Yes, sir, from LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8275)|
| 2:17:57| So this makes it up to how many changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| Have we made 110 changes to this sector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8279)|
| 2:18:02| There have been quite a few for this sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8282)|
| 2:18:04| Yeah, but you're recommending it this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8284)|
| 2:18:06| You're not complaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8286)|
| 2:18:07| You're recommending, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8287)|
| 2:18:09| You saw the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8289)|
| 2:18:11| You see the commission recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8291)|
| 2:18:13| It's all part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8293)|
| 2:18:15| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8295)|
| 2:18:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8296)|
| 2:18:18| Their recommendation, just to clarify it and what it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8298)|
| 2:18:22| is to MDR and slope protection area, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8302)|
| 2:18:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8308)|
| 2:18:30| The second has withdrawn his substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8312)|
| 2:18:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8313)|
| 2:18:34| So we're voting on approval based on MPC recommendation on 2D15SP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8314)|
| 2:18:41| which is a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| Everybody clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8323)|
| 2:18:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8324)|
| 2:18:45| Any no more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8325)|
| 2:18:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8328)|
| 2:18:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8329)|
| 2:18:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8330)|
| 2:18:51| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8331)|
| 2:18:52| Yeah, one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8332)|
| 2:18:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8333)|
| 2:18:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8334)|
| 2:18:55| Nobody else want to stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8335)|
| 2:18:56| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8336)|
| 2:18:59| Then we'll be here until 12 on this next one then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8339)|
| 2:19:04| Discussion down to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8344)|
| 2:19:05| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8345)|
| 2:19:06| 1-D-15-RZ, request of Masonic Investments, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8346)|
| 2:19:10| for rezoning from agricultural to PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8350)|
| 2:19:13| and OB office medical and related services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8353)|
| 2:19:16| Property located south side Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8356)|
| 2:19:18| southeast of Westcott Boulevard in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8358)|
| 2:19:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8363)|
| 2:19:24| The recommendation from MPC is county commission approved PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8364)|
| 2:19:29| at the density of up to 6 million units per acre for the entire site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8369)|
| 2:19:32| And that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8374)|
| 2:19:35| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8375)|
| 2:19:36| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8376)|
| 2:19:37| I'd like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| That we approve it at PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| but that we send this back to MPC for the staff to, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8383)|
| 2:19:50| determine the number of acres in each of these slope areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8390)|
| 2:19:56| and that the recommendation coming back to us be whatever is allowed in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8396)|
| 2:20:01| particular slopes that I enumerated a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8401)|
| 2:20:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8404)|
| 2:20:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8407)|
| 2:20:08| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8408)|
| 2:20:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| So the motion is to send it back to MPC with the designated slope areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8411)|
| 2:20:15| and the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| We're going to do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8417)|
| 2:20:18| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8418)|
| 2:20:21| We'll do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8421)|
| 2:20:22| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8422)|
| 2:20:25| No, go ahead with the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8425)|
| 2:20:26| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8426)|
| 2:20:27| So, again, if this were approved at the six units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8427)|
| 2:20:31| the developer can go for 460 units on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8431)|
| 2:20:35| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8435)|
| 2:20:36| With a site plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8436)|
| 2:20:40| Wait, wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8440)|
| 2:20:41| I'm not sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8441)|
| 2:20:42| If you could clarify, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8442)|
| 2:20:44| If this is approved, it comes back to you for analysis on slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8444)|
| 2:20:49| and they can only get so many units in that slope area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8449)|
| 2:20:54| So the zoning would be approved and he could move on to use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8454)|
| 2:20:58| Well, but what you're going to bring back to us to approve is how many acres in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8458)|
| 2:21:03| zero to 15, how many acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| And that's going to be up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| That could be, well, PR is that could be the six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8467)|
| 2:21:12| But whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8472)|
| 2:21:13| When you get to the 10 to 15, you're going to have to cut it down to two to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8473)|
| 2:21:19| When you get to over 15, you're going to have to have two acres to each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8479)|
| 2:21:22| Well, sir, we can apply that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8482)|
| 2:21:24| And that would be our intent during the actual site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8484)|
| 2:21:28| or the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8488)|
| 2:21:32| That would not come back to the county commission, however.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8492)|
| 2:21:34| That would come straight to the MPC commission to be approved or denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8494)|
| 2:21:41| And that's where it would stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| Then I would make a change to that substitute motion to move then that it be charged to the MPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8503)|
| 2:21:56| that they follow the slope protection agreement when they approve the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8516)|
| 2:22:04| And I think I'm going to talk to this and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| Vote this out first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8527)|
| 2:22:10| All right, Commissioner McGregor, do you agree to the changes in his motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| Because you're the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8533)|
| 2:22:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8534)|
| 2:22:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8535)|
| 2:22:16| Would you tell us one more time what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8536)|
| 2:22:20| You, sir, are voting on a substitute motion that tells the MPC, if approved, this one to six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8540)|
| 2:22:26| that they use the precise slope analysis to issue the units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8546)|
| 2:22:33| That would be one to six on the zero to 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8553)|
| 2:22:38| On the 15 and up, it's going to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8558)|
| 2:22:41| It's going to be what the slope protection plan we've fought for a year and a half on says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8561)|
| 2:22:47| It's going to be whatever that slope protection agreement said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8567)|
| 2:22:54| Let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8574)|
| 2:22:56| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8576)|
| 2:22:57| Now that we're on that, I didn't want to muddy the water, but it's pretty darn muddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8577)|
| 2:23:03| My question is, you know, there seems to be, and believe me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8583)|
| 2:23:09| I know I was part of that long, long process as we talked slope protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8589)|
| 2:23:13| and, yeah, there were some bad things done, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8593)|
| 2:23:18| Just not bad, I don't mean bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| It was a lot of work, let's say it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8600)|
| 2:23:25| Do you agree with Commissioner Brown's interpretation of the guidance document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8605)|
| 2:23:32| whatever you want to call it, but the slope protection plan that we approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8612)|
| 2:23:38| I agree philosophically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8618)|
| 2:23:42| If you look at the general description for the planned residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8622)|
| 2:23:46| it says these regulations are established, and I'm paraphrasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8626)|
| 2:23:51| to provide optional methods of land development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8631)|
| 2:23:54| which encourage more imaginative solutions to environmental design problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| So the idea is really to minimize site disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8638)|
| 2:24:01| If you have floodplains, wetlands, that kind of stuff, you're trying to stay away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8641)|
| 2:24:06| The concern I have is I think you're getting the same thing if you were to simply approve at six dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8646)|
| 2:24:17| How can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8657)|
| 2:24:18| Simply because the concept plan would have that analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8658)|
| 2:24:22| and we'd actually have more information available at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8662)|
| 2:24:26| So he could end up with less than six dwelling units per acre based upon the review during the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8666)|
| 2:24:34| Well, as I said a while ago, you've got 14 acres here at 25 to 40, which would give you actually seven units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8674)|
| 2:24:42| But if you took it to the sixth, that's 24, no, 84 that you could move down to the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8682)|
| 2:24:50| But you can't transfer something you don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8690)|
| 2:24:52| You don't have 84.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8692)|
| 2:24:54| You've got seven units on that slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8694)|
| 2:24:57| Well, I think the whole idea is not to put those units on the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8697)|
| 2:25:01| Well, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8701)|
| 2:25:02| I totally agree with that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8704)|
| 2:25:05| But you don't have 14 up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| I mean, you don't have 84 up there to start, even if you've got 14 acres at 60 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8707)|
| 2:25:13| You don't actually legally by that agreement, you don't have 84 up there to transfer down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8713)|
| 2:25:19| You have seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8719)|
| 2:25:22| Yeah, so that's kind of my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8722)|
| 2:25:25| I think there's some differences of opinion on that particular issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8725)|
| 2:25:29| and that's the crux of all these slope, you know, hilly developments, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8729)|
| 2:25:34| Are they allowed to, as Commissioner Smith say, within their boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8734)|
| 2:25:41| build where they can in a more dense situation based on them, you know, protecting that slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8741)|
| 2:25:49| And I guess that, you know, I would like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8749)|
| 2:25:53| And I would like to see that before this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8753)|
| 2:25:56| I'm torn with how to vote on this particular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8756)|
| 2:26:01| But that's kind of my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8761)|
| 2:26:04| Enough time has gone by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8764)|
| 2:26:05| So I think it would be good for you all to come back to us with some type of, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8765)|
| 2:26:10| we've been working with this guidance, this plan for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8770)|
| 2:26:15| This is what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8775)|
| 2:26:16| This is how we're planning on dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8776)|
| 2:26:18| And pick out a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8778)|
| 2:26:19| Pick out this one and a couple more of those kind of interesting ones, and tell us what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8779)|
| 2:26:24| Because I think we need some education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| The latest example I could give you, we did about five months ago down to Marina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8786)|
| 2:26:33| where the road crosses over, the I-140 crosses over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8793)|
| 2:26:38| We took straight up and down property, a cliff, and gave him X number of units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8798)|
| 2:26:48| the same as we gave him flat land down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8808)|
| 2:26:51| Now, he's not going to build up there, granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| But he got the same number of units up here that they did down here that he can move down here, which he don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8813)|
| 2:26:59| He only had, in that case, you couldn't build on a 50 percent slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8819)|
| 2:27:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8825)|
| 2:27:06| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8826)|
| 2:27:07| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8827)|
| 2:27:08| Commissioner, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8828)|
| 2:27:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| As I stated on the previous vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8831)|
| 2:27:15| I believe there's more discussion taking place that I'm prepared to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8835)|
| 2:27:21| if it is beyond what the Metropolitan Planning Commission recommended to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8841)|
| 2:27:29| So we have before us a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8849)|
| 2:27:33| I will vote against this substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8853)|
| 2:27:37| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8857)|
| 2:27:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8858)|
| 2:27:40| If I'm not mistaken, in the MPC meeting there was also some discussion about additional density granted to the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8860)|
| 2:27:48| because of the conservatory and a hiking trail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8868)|
| 2:27:54| There are density bonuses available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8874)|
| 2:27:57| The one thing, maybe to clarify, because what I'm trying to communicate is how we would interpret the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8877)|
| 2:28:03| and actually try to implement it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8883)|
| 2:28:07| The way that I'm hearing the motion right now is this plan, the Hillside and Ridgetop plan, is right now advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8887)|
| 2:28:17| It's a guidance document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| What I think I'm hearing is that you want us to apply the components of the plan very strictly to the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8899)|
| 2:28:31| Why spend a year and a half on something that you're not going to use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8911)|
| 2:28:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8915)|
| 2:28:36| Whatever it takes to make it law, Mr. Law Director, make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8916)|
| 2:28:39| I'm not arguing the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| All I'm trying to say is I'm trying to make sure we understand the guidance we're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8921)|
| 2:28:46| I understand you, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8929)|
| 2:28:54| Mr. Davis, is six units per acre acceptable with what they recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8934)|
| 2:29:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8941)|
| 2:29:02| I can move forward with the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8942)|
| 2:29:04| And if a user comes to me that's different than what would be permitted under PR 106,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8944)|
| 2:29:10| I would come back before MPC and I would come back before you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8950)|
| 2:29:16| David, let me ask you a question here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8956)|
| 2:29:19| The staff recommended this six units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8959)|
| 2:29:24| What was the number of votes on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8964)|
| 2:29:27| The commission voted or actually recommended six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8967)|
| 2:29:31| The vote on that one was 13-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8971)|
| 2:29:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8975)|
| 2:29:36| And quite honestly, those were two abstaining votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8976)|
| 2:29:38| They were not negative votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8978)|
| 2:29:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8979)|
| 2:29:40| And then if we vote as MPC recommends and it goes PR, which is planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8980)|
| 2:29:49| the plan comes back to you all to research and look to see that they're not overstepping a lot of boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8989)|
| 2:29:57| and build a six-story high unit that's got like ten units per level in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=8997)|
| 2:30:05| You will review this and see that it's done like it's supposed to be done under planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9005)|
| 2:30:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9011)|
| 2:30:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9013)|
| 2:30:14| As a matter of fact, I think we would really want to try to set the stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9014)|
| 2:30:19| depending on Mr. Davis' timing, to try to sit down and work with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9019)|
| 2:30:25| and maybe spend a little more time on the front end so that we're not disagreeing at the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9025)|
| 2:30:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9030)|
| 2:30:31| So, commission, from what I understand, if I'm wrong, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9031)|
| 2:30:35| They've come to us and we have not done the sector plan differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9035)|
| 2:30:42| We're just doing the rezoning to where he can have six units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9042)|
| 2:30:47| what staff or the commission has recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9047)|
| 2:30:50| Both will be by recommendation, except for Brown's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9050)|
| 2:30:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9053)|
| 2:30:54| Except for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9054)|
| 2:30:55| So it's basically what was recommended to us we're going to vote for, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9055)|
| 2:31:00| On the first vote, it's a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9060)|
| 2:31:02| It's a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9062)|
| 2:31:03| The first one is a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9063)|
| 2:31:04| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9064)|
| 2:31:05| Yeah, but after that, if it fails, then it's the original as approved by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9065)|
| 2:31:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9070)|
| 2:31:11| That's all I need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9071)|
| 2:31:12| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| Commissioner Brown, I understand exactly where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9074)|
| 2:31:19| Do you maybe want to reconsider and let the MPC staff do the next step with the concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9079)|
| 2:31:28| And the reason I'm bringing that up is originally the staff recommendation was three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9088)|
| 2:31:35| In the MPC meeting, Mr. Clancy made a motion for five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9095)|
| 2:31:41| and then finally when everything ended up, it was changed to up to six dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9101)|
| 2:31:47| So?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9107)|
| 2:31:50| Well, I will to move on with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9110)|
| 2:31:53| but there has to be some way that we can communicate to the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9113)|
| 2:32:00| which by and large is people who are in that business and want as much as they can get on a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9120)|
| 2:32:11| that they're going to have to start working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9131)|
| 2:32:13| And if it takes us to put it into law to make it more than advisory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9133)|
| 2:32:18| then I'm going to have Bud draw up a resolution to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9138)|
| 2:32:22| because somewhere you have to tie the bell on the cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9142)|
| 2:32:27| And they ain't making any more land, and it's getting harder and harder to find it to build on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9147)|
| 2:32:32| And I feel sorry for Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9152)|
| 2:32:34| He's got a piece of property here that, you know, in Gatlinburg, they let him build on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9154)|
| 2:32:41| I mean, you can hang it upside down in Gatlinburg, but this is not Gatlinburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9161)|
| 2:32:45| So if we can come back, I'll discuss this after we vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9165)|
| 2:32:51| Sir, are you withdrawing your stubs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9171)|
| 2:32:53| I'll withdraw the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9173)|
| 2:32:54| I'll withdraw the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9174)|
| 2:32:55| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9175)|
| 2:32:57| All right, we have a motion to approve our NPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9177)|
| 2:32:59| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9179)|
| 2:33:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9183)|
| 2:33:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9185)|
| 2:33:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9186)|
| 2:33:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9187)|
| 2:33:08| Any other opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9188)|
| 2:33:09| Ten to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9189)|
| 2:33:10| Ten to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9190)|
| 2:33:11| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9191)|
| 2:33:12| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9192)|
| 2:33:15| Thank you all for your time and your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9195)|
| 2:33:16| We got the zoning right here real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9196)|
| 2:33:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9198)|
| 2:33:19| That was the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9199)|
| 2:33:20| That was the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9200)|
| 2:33:21| We already did the SP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9201)|
| 2:33:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9202)|
| 2:33:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9203)|
| 2:33:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9204)|
| 2:33:25| It lasted so long I thought it was just one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9205)|
| 2:33:26| Now, I will say, Commissioner Brown, I support what you're wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9206)|
| 2:33:30| We spent a lot of time, and if they're not using that document strongly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9210)|
| 2:33:35| I think we need to take the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9215)|
| 2:33:38| Forget about the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9218)|
| 2:33:39| It's a good document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9219)|
| 2:33:40| It's a good document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9220)|
| 2:33:41| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9221)|
| 2:33:42| So I do support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9222)|
| 2:33:43| I would just like some more training on how you guys are applying it or not applying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9223)|
| 2:33:47| But, you see, they were told differently by Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9227)|
| 2:33:50| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9230)|
| 2:33:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9231)|
| 2:33:52| Now, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9232)|
| 2:33:53| You said we was through voting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9235)|
| 2:33:56| We can't vote on both of them at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150323?start=9236)|
