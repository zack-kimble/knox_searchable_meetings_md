| 0:07:11| Yes, sir. On July 24, 2023, the Texas Knox County Sheriff's Office conducted an underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=431.04)|
| 0:07:17| beer buy, the 6400 Mandeville Pike. The arrestee failed to look at the underage person's ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=437.04)|
| 0:07:24| and sold him a three pack of Modelo. All right. And this is the third offense for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=444.04)|
| 0:07:31| business within the past 12 months? It's 12 months? Yeah. Right out of it. November 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=451.04)|
| 0:07:40| April 20? Yes, it is. Yeah. All right, sir. You've heard the report from the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=460.04)|
| 0:07:49| Do you admit it or deny it? Yeah, I admit it. Admit it? Okay. What steps have you taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=469.04)|
| 0:07:54| to keep this from happening again? Actually, what happened is, what's happening to me is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=474.04)|
| 0:08:01| between this two, second and third offense, I hired six people. Nobody wants to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=481.04)|
| 0:08:09| That is the problem. And actually what happens is they do the scanning and everything in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=489.04)|
| 0:08:15| front of me when I'm there. And when it's aligned and they see that he's old enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=495.04)|
| 0:08:20| tattoos, all that, oh, he's old enough. So I fired like five people in this four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=500.04)|
| 0:08:29| I'm struggling because of that. What I have decided is I'm going to put two employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=509.04)|
| 0:08:36| One is going to check just the ID. That's what I did now. So I think that should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=516.04)|
| 0:08:45| you know, and I put signs over there. Spanish people, a lot of Spanish people, they come to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=525.04)|
| 0:08:52| they come at the store, so they don't understand English properly. So I've made, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=532.04)|
| 0:08:57| in Spanish too. I mean, I don't know what should I do more and increase my own timings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=537.04)|
| 0:09:04| I'm going to, I'm standing there more timely. The morning, we don't sell that much beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=544.04)|
| 0:09:10| and we have no problems in the mornings. Only the problem is in the evening time when it's a rush,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=550.04)|
| 0:09:15| they get confused or something because they're alone. So I put one more people, one more cashier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=555.04)|
| 0:09:20| with them. And now I hired one guy so that he's going to check the ID only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=560.04)|
| 0:09:28| Chairman, turn it over to you. Thank you. I do notice you've had your permit since 2010| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=568.04)|
| 0:09:38| and did quite well until just this past year, it appears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=578.04)|
| 0:09:43| Yeah, in 13, I'm running this store for 13 years, never had that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=583.04)|
| 0:09:48| All right. And suddenly, I don't know why it's such a big deal. It's just, I mean, if a person is coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=588.04)|
| 0:09:54| you can easily figure it out that yes, he's underage. And the reason why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=594.04)|
| 0:09:58| what they are saying is the guy who came last time, he had a tattoo in his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=598.04)|
| 0:10:03| So in Florida or somewhere, I don't know, it's illegal to have, you know, tattoos under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=603.04)|
| 0:10:10| So that's what he was assuming. And that's what he was not even looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=610.04)|
| 0:10:13| He was just texting on his phone. Just not paying attention. Are there any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=613.04)|
| 0:10:19| And we have the scanning system. This is very easy. Can you please provide me the ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=619.04)|
| 0:10:25| It's so easy, just have to scan it. I understand. I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=625.04)|
| 0:10:31| Does anyone have any comments? Commissioner Spoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=631.04)|
| 0:10:38| Thank you, Madam Chair. Do your employees understand that if they sell beer to a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=638.04)|
| 0:10:47| they're going to end up having to go to court? So that's what I was discussing with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=647.04)|
| 0:10:55| You know, that guy who sold to the minor, he didn't even told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=655.04)|
| 0:10:59| I got a phone call from the clerk office, Kathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=659.04)|
| 0:11:03| She called me and said, hey, you know that you have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=663.04)|
| 0:11:07| I said, what kind of meeting you're talking about? You said you have a beer violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=667.04)|
| 0:11:12| I said, are you serious? That's what I was telling her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=672.04)|
| 0:11:15| I have to ask three times. I asked her, is it true? Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=675.04)|
| 0:11:21| I mean, I was so stunned at that time. And then when he went to the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=681.04)|
| 0:11:27| then he came to me and showed me that the beer violation permit or whatever application has not been submitted at the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=687.04)|
| 0:11:35| He texted me and I showed to him too. I mean, I have it on my phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=695.04)|
| 0:11:40| Court dismissed it. It's been dismissed. So he was saying that, see, I was telling you I did nothing wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=700.04)|
| 0:11:48| And he got he quit the job before even telling me this thing has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=708.04)|
| 0:11:52| He was blaming something else that I'm busy. I cannot work and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=712.04)|
| 0:11:57| And he quit the job. And then when I got the phone call from her, I was like, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=717.04)|
| 0:12:04| Okay. So Sheriff's Office, when you issue that citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=724.04)|
| 0:12:09| there's no process to notify management that they were in violation of selling beer to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=729.04)|
| 0:12:18| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=738.04)|
| 0:12:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=742.04)|
| 0:12:32| Seeing no other lights, I'll turn this over to District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=752.04)|
| 0:12:38| I have some real concerns about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=758.04)|
| 0:12:42| I'm very concerned about serving to underage young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=762.04)|
| 0:12:49| Mr. Law Director, I just wanted to make sure, is it the third violation, suspension of their beer license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=769.04)|
| 0:12:57| Under our ordinance, third violation, you may offer the violator choice between a 90 day suspension or a two thousand dollar fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=777.04)|
| 0:13:06| No, you don't have to. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=786.04)|
| 0:13:11| I guess we have an option, but I'm going to I want to make sure this time this is the final time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=791.04)|
| 0:13:16| It's not going to happen again. That's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=796.04)|
| 0:13:20| I would ask, do I make a motion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=800.04)|
| 0:13:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=804.04)|
| 0:13:25| That we suspend his law license for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=805.04)|
| 0:13:27| Beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=807.04)|
| 0:13:28| Beer license. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=808.04)|
| 0:13:40| The ordinance is couched in terms of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=820.04)|
| 0:13:44| So these are penalties that were put in place to have some level of consistency amongst violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=824.04)|
| 0:13:53| but you are not required to follow this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=833.04)|
| 0:13:57| So it's really up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=837.04)|
| 0:14:08| Did you have something to say, Mr. Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=848.04)|
| 0:14:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=852.04)|
| 0:14:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=855.04)|
| 0:14:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=857.04)|
| 0:14:18| We have a proper motion on the floor for revocation, a 90 day revocation of the license or suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=858.04)|
| 0:14:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=866.04)|
| 0:14:27| Of the license and a proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=867.04)|
| 0:14:31| Is there any more discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=871.04)|
| 0:14:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=877.04)|
| 0:14:39| Mr. J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=879.04)|
| 0:14:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=880.04)|
| 0:14:41| I just want to make sure we think about this in the precedence that we're sending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=881.04)|
| 0:14:51| because we have had other establishments around the county that have had multiple offenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=891.04)|
| 0:14:56| and we have offered them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=896.04)|
| 0:14:58| We haven't rushed to just take the revocation of the suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=898.04)|
| 0:15:05| I just want to take a second to pause and think about an applicant who has come here who has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=905.04)|
| 0:15:15| yes, we made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=915.04)|
| 0:15:17| We're having staffing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=917.04)|
| 0:15:19| And while he understands the issue at hand and is trying to find a way to stem that in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=919.04)|
| 0:15:29| and, yes, he has violated a third offense, but as recently as six or eight months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=929.04)|
| 0:15:36| we had an establishment in Hardin Valley who had a third offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=936.04)|
| 0:15:40| and we gave that option and that we really think about reserving sort of that harshest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=940.04)|
| 0:15:47| we're going to cut off your business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=947.04)|
| 0:15:49| your ability to do business to the people who are showing virtually no interest in either solving the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=949.04)|
| 0:15:56| or are moving their license from one family member to another and are sort of chronic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=956.04)|
| 0:16:03| The Sheriff's Department often comes to us and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=963.04)|
| 0:16:06| these are chronic issues with people who are really either ignoring the laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=966.04)|
| 0:16:11| or ignoring the processes and are not trying to get better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=971.04)|
| 0:16:15| and I'm not hearing that from our Sheriff's Department this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=975.04)|
| 0:16:19| that rushing right to suspend means they may not have the ability to continue to make improvements and be in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=979.04)|
| 0:16:28| So I just want to make sure we reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=988.04)|
| 0:16:31| I would be much more comfortable with a fine or giving them the option of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=991.04)|
| 0:16:37| I mean, if he takes the option to take the 90 days, that's one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=997.04)|
| 0:16:40| but sometimes we have to give a little grace to people who are trying to do business in this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1000.04)|
| 0:16:46| and reserve our harshest judgments for those who are flaunting the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1006.0400000000001)|
| 0:16:50| not trying to get through some staffing issues, which I think everybody's having right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1010.0400000000001)|
| 0:16:59| Thank you. District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1019.0400000000001)|
| 0:17:02| I just want to echo Commissioner Jay's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1022.0400000000001)|
| 0:17:06| We always give people a choice, so if we don't give them a choice, I'm voting no on this. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1026.04)|
| 0:17:19| Thank you. Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1039.04)|
| 0:17:21| Thank you. I don't normally do this, but I just want to step in for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1041.04)|
| 0:17:29| There's a danger in not following these proposed schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1049.04)|
| 0:17:36| It's the reason we put it in place in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1056.04)|
| 0:17:40| Many, many years ago when I was a young lawyer, we had rules regarding how close you had to be to various kinds of establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1060.04)|
| 0:17:51| if you were going to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1071.04)|
| 0:17:54| from enforcing them because we weren't doing them evenly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1074.04)|
| 0:17:58| Some places we'd waive it, some places we would make them meet the requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1078.04)|
| 0:18:04| and eventually we told somebody they couldn't open up and they took us to federal court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1084.04)|
| 0:18:08| and the federal court permanently enjoined us from enforcing them because of disparate enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1088.04)|
| 0:18:14| So while you do have discretion, I think that unless there's something really that stands out about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1094.04)|
| 0:18:24| it is somewhat dangerous to start putting down penalties ad hoc| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1104.04)|
| 0:18:29| because if we do that too much, it can have the effect of a finding of disparate treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1109.04)|
| 0:18:38| and then we may lose some of our ability to have discretion in those cases where we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1118.04)|
| 0:18:43| So just wanted to point that out, that there's a reason these things are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1123.04)|
| 0:18:51| District 5 is recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1131.04)|
| 0:18:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1133.04)|
| 0:18:55| I agree to a point with what Commissioner Jay has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1135.04)|
| 0:19:01| and we have given some businesses latitude when they've had violations over multiple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1141.04)|
| 0:19:09| We've got a situation where three strikes in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1149.04)|
| 0:19:17| The danger is not to him, the danger is to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1157.04)|
| 0:19:23| because they've only caught the three people this year that they've sold beer to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1163.04)|
| 0:19:30| How many more has that business sold to minors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1170.04)|
| 0:19:35| If we don't do anything and he again sells to a minor and that minor gets out on Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1175.04)|
| 0:19:43| and ends up doing something with an automobile that wouldn't be very positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1183.04)|
| 0:19:51| have we done our due diligence here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1191.04)|
| 0:19:54| The danger is to the community because right now he's not following the rules that the state has set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1194.04)|
| 0:20:00| and it's a privilege to sell beer in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1200.04)|
| 0:20:04| He's had three strikes, three strikes, you're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1204.04)|
| 0:20:07| He needs to wake up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1207.04)|
| 0:20:09| Can I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1209.04)|
| 0:20:11| I had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1211.04)|
| 0:20:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1214.04)|
| 0:20:18| Seeing no other lights, yes, sir, do you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1218.04)|
| 0:20:22| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1222.04)|
| 0:20:23| Do you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1223.04)|
| 0:20:24| Yeah, actually what I'm saying is I hired the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1224.04)|
| 0:20:28| I mean he was a part-timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1228.04)|
| 0:20:31| I'm working all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1231.04)|
| 0:20:33| So what's happening is only three days he was here, three days, five to ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1233.04)|
| 0:20:39| That was his timings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1239.04)|
| 0:20:40| The rest of the timings, I am there and the morning lady, she is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1240.04)|
| 0:20:45| And he was just hired a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1245.04)|
| 0:20:49| So do I hear you say you work the business full-time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1249.04)|
| 0:20:52| Yes, I'm working at the cash register and 100% nobody can get from me, no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1252.04)|
| 0:20:58| Even I know people I refuse so many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1258.04)|
| 0:21:01| I respect whatever he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1261.04)|
| 0:21:03| I agree with him too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1263.04)|
| 0:21:05| I mean but look at my 13 years, never had any problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1265.04)|
| 0:21:10| Don't look at the one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1270.04)|
| 0:21:12| Look at 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1272.04)|
| 0:21:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1273.04)|
| 0:21:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1274.04)|
| 0:21:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1275.04)|
| 0:21:18| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1278.04)|
| 0:21:21| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1281.04)|
| 0:21:22| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1282.04)|
| 0:21:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1283.04)|
| 0:21:25| To our chair's office, you often are able to sort of put context around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1285.04)|
| 0:21:30| violations that you bring to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1290.04)|
| 0:21:36| We have received complaints on this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1296.04)|
| 0:21:39| It was a specific employee about probably a year and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1299.04)|
| 0:21:45| We were unable to get that employee to do what they said was being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1305.04)|
| 0:21:52| So you had prior checks that they checked fine on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1312.04)|

| 0:22:17| I can look and see if it was the same employees, different employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1337.04)|
| 0:22:21| They checked the IDs or they didn't check the IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1341.04)|

| 0:22:39| four years since I've been doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1359.04)|

| 0:22:44| monthly they've done exactly what they should with the exception of three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1364.04)|

| 0:23:08| option versus just automatically do the suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1388.04)|
| 0:23:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1394.04)|

| 0:23:32| So I'm going to leave my motion as stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1412.04)|

| 0:28:47| So from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1727.04)|
| 0:28:48| From right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1728.04)|

| 0:28:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1732.04)|
| 0:28:53| And Sheriff's Department, I'm assuming you'll be making periodic checks on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1733.04)|
| 0:28:58| We'll check in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1738.04)|
| 0:29:00| Just so he's aware, he needs to either lock up the beer coolers or remove the alcohol from public view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1740.04)|
| 0:29:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1747.04)|
| 0:29:08| Or take like butcher's paper and cover the coolers so people can't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1748.04)|
| 0:29:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1751.04)|

| 0:29:36| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1776.04)|

| 0:29:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1793.04)|
| 0:29:54| Can we have a report from the Beer Board Inspector, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1794.04)|
| 0:29:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1797.04)|
| 0:29:58| On July 24th, Detective of Knox County Sheriff's Office conducted an alcohol compliance check at Easy Stop located at 7323 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1798.04)|
| 0:30:07| The defendant sold an alcoholic beverage to an underage person after checking their ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1807.04)|
| 0:30:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1816.04)|
| 0:30:17| Mr. Carver?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1817.04)|
| 0:30:19| I was about to say, Your Honor, that after the number of years I appeared in front of you when you were on the bench,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1819.04)|
| 0:30:26| the old habits will die a little bit hard there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1826.04)|
| 0:30:30| This did occur on that date, and I want to provide a little bit of context as to what happened that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1830.04)|
| 0:30:36| and to what policies and procedures Easy Stop has in place to prevent this type of activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1836.04)|
| 0:30:43| We have spoken with Mr. Gonzalez, the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1843.04)|
| 0:30:47| Mr. Hunt and I both met with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1847.04)|
| 0:30:50| He was immediately suspended from Easy Stop when we learned of this violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1850.04)|
| 0:30:58| His comment was that he misread the identification, put it into the system, entered it manually, and made the transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1858.04)|
| 0:31:09| He, as recently as May 11th of 2023, so roughly two months before this incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1869.04)|
| 0:31:19| he had completed responsible alcohol sale training and has a certificate for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1879.04)|
| 0:31:24| Easy Stop has a procedure in place where its employees who conduct both beer and tobacco sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1884.04)|
| 0:31:32| must go into their online system and acknowledge, review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1892.04)|
| 0:31:37| and understanding of company policy rules and regulations regarding alcohol sales, tobacco sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1897.04)|
| 0:31:47| Mr. Gonzalez, the employee, had done that in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1907.04)|
| 0:31:51| That's required to be completed within the first six days of each month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1911.04)|
| 0:31:56| and then that's uploaded into Easy Stop's system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1916.04)|
| 0:31:59| Not only does the employee sign that they got the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1919.04)|
| 0:32:02| but they also have to initial acknowledgment that they're not to sell alcohol to minors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1922.04)|
| 0:32:09| that they are supposed to check the ID and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1929.04)|
| 0:32:13| They also acknowledge that Easy Stop has a third-party mystery shopper program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1933.04)|
| 0:32:20| and this is not Easy Stop employees going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1940.04)|
| 0:32:23| This is a program that they pay for, and any number of things are checked on those visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1943.04)|
| 0:32:28| including the procedure for checking IDs to prevent sale of alcohol to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1948.04)|
| 0:32:34| So this location that we're here talking about had been checked each month from July of 2022 to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1954.04)|
| 0:32:45| I think it's important to point out that in both May of 2023 and June of 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1965.04)|
| 0:32:53| the third-party mystery shopper, when they checked this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1973.04)|
| 0:32:57| it was actually this employee that was checked, the employee that mis-entered the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1977.04)|
| 0:33:05| The mystery shopper program checks about 20 things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1985.04)|
| 0:33:09| and on both occasions, they found no violations by this employee when they checked at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1989.04)|
| 0:33:16| So there are a number of policies and procedures that Easy Stop has in place for this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1996.04)|
| 0:33:22| and their locations throughout East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2002.04)|
| 0:33:25| As you can see, this was their first offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2005.04)|
| 0:33:28| and certainly happy to answer any questions that you all have, either for me or for Mr. Hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2008.04)|
| 0:33:35| And we also have three other employees of the organization here who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2015.04)|
| 0:33:39| if there's something you all ask that Mr. Hunt doesn't know, somebody else may be able to provide that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2019.04)|
| 0:33:46| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2026.04)|
| 0:33:49| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2029.04)|
| 0:33:51| Madam Chair, are the Easy Stop employees familiar that the state of Tennessee has made checking an ID a no-brainer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2031.04)|
| 0:34:02| In other words, your driver's license, if both of you gentlemen pull it out, it looks like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2042.04)|
| 0:34:08| If you're under 21, it looks like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2048.04)|
| 0:34:11| So the state has made it idiot-proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2051.04)|
| 0:34:15| So do the Easy Stop employees understand that when they're looking at an ID, if it looks like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2055.04)|
| 0:34:21| you tell them to put the beer back in the cooler and leave the store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2061.04)|
| 0:34:25| That's correct, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2065.04)|
| 0:34:27| We also typically require, we had previously asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2067.04)|
| 0:34:33| we will require in the future the employees to take the driver's license from the purchaser, potential purchaser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2073.04)|
| 0:34:42| and scan it through the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2082.04)|
| 0:34:44| Those capabilities were present when Lucillo made the sale, but he did not scan the card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2084.04)|
| 0:34:50| which would have told him, you know, underage, don't make the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2090.04)|
| 0:34:54| The register system verifies the age for the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2094.04)|
| 0:34:58| There is pushback from our customers to not give the driver's license to our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2098.04)|
| 0:35:06| because they're afraid the government may be tracking their purchases or whereabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2106.04)|
| 0:35:10| Well, I hate to tell them that the cell phone already tells everybody what they're doing anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2110.04)|
| 0:35:14| but that's another story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2114.04)|
| 0:35:16| So Lucillo had been entering the ID and entered it incorrectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2116.04)|
| 0:35:21| even though he had the capability to check, you know, electronically and also see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2121.04)|
| 0:35:27| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2127.04)|
| 0:35:33| Well, again, they don't even need to put it in any kind of system because if it comes out like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2133.04)|
| 0:35:38| you just say no thank you and send them on their way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2138.04)|
| 0:35:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2141.04)|
| 0:35:42| You don't even have to go to the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2142.04)|
| 0:35:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2144.04)|
| 0:35:47| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2147.04)|
| 0:35:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2150.04)|
| 0:35:51| This is in my district, and I do see that you've had your permit for six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2151.04)|
| 0:35:56| and this is your first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2156.04)|
| 0:35:59| I am allowed by law to offer you either a 30-day suspension of your permit or a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2159.04)|
| 0:36:10| Which would you prefer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2170.04)|
| 0:36:13| The fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2173.04)|
| 0:36:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2174.04)|
| 0:36:15| Neither, but the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2175.04)|
| 0:36:16| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2176.04)|
| 0:36:18| I guess I should say Judge Hill because I don't think those things leave in retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2178.04)|
| 0:36:24| We operate 24 stores, 25 after Labor Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2184.04)|
| 0:36:30| and we do about a million and one transactions of beer each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2190.04)|
| 0:36:35| and this is the first mystery shop we've bailed in five years anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2195.04)|
| 0:36:40| I didn't know you had that many stores, but I do know that you're a good operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2200.04)|
| 0:36:45| I'm very familiar with your stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2205.04)|
| 0:36:50| Hearing that, I'm making a motion to accept their preference of a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2210.04)|
| 0:36:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2219.04)|
| 0:37:01| Motion by Hill, second by Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2221.04)|
| 0:37:04| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2224.04)|
| 0:37:06| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2226.04)|
| 0:37:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2227.04)|
