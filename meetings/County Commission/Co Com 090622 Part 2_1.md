| 2:17:51| that somehow the MPC guided me to acquire a flat piece of property are ludicrous on the surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8271)|
| 2:17:59| My business is about paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8279)|
| 2:18:02| And if you look at the demographics and you look at 4,000, soon to be 5,000 people working less than a mile away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8282)|
| 2:18:08| and no housing to support that population, if you're in the business of building neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8288)|
| 2:18:14| you want to build close to that employment base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8294)|
| 2:18:18| I don't need any MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8298)|
| 2:18:20| I don't need anybody to tell me that's where people are going to choose to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8300)|
| 2:18:24| And that's the reason that the property was originally acquired, the reason that we changed the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8304)|
| 2:18:31| We always wanted to pursue medium-density residential on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8311)|
| 2:18:35| but the improvements to John Sevier Highway and sewer capacity for more units were not available when we started the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8315)|
| 2:18:43| During the construction of the project, those things, John Sevier Highway was improved to add the center turn lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8323)|
| 2:18:49| and sewer capacity became available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8329)|
| 2:18:52| Those were the primary drivers to ask for more density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8332)|
| 2:18:55| and the realization that in South Knoxville people are going to be moving here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8335)|
| 2:19:00| they're going to want to live here, and flat ground is a rare commodity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8340)|
| 2:19:05| and it is what should be used to build density whenever possible to protect, as Mr. Brown so correctly pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8345)|
| 2:19:12| the hillsides and the vistas that are created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8352)|
| 2:19:18| The color drawings clearly show that in all of South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8358)|
| 2:19:22| there's only one other site as large as this that's able to be built on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8362)|
| 2:19:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8366)|
| 2:19:28| When I finish, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8368)|
| 2:19:30| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8370)|
| 2:19:31| I'd like to just say a couple more things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8371)|
| 2:19:37| First off, we had no problem with the original zoning and condos at one to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8377)|
| 2:19:43| We supported you in that when you came to our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8383)|
| 2:19:46| We even came up here and supported that with your application on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8386)|
| 2:19:51| Our problem comes when you start trying to get around that, when it wasn't enough, you start coming back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8391)|
| 2:19:58| and we've got to get somebody else involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8398)|
| 2:20:00| We bring this in, and we talk about smoke and mirrors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8400)|
| 2:20:04| Nobody had any more smoke and mirrors than what you've given us, Mr. During, and I'm sorry, but that's the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8404)|
| 2:20:10| Now, you talk about building on hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8410)|
| 2:20:14| You ever try to purchase any property or build anything in Gatlinburg, have you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8414)|
| 2:20:20| Well, I'll present to you that they build on probably 60 percent slopes in Gatlinburg because it's a commodity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8420)|
| 2:20:29| You talked about needing additional housing units there in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8429)|
| 2:20:36| There is not 4,500 people working there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8436)|
| 2:20:39| There might be in ten years, but let me tell you this, you folks, right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8439)|
| 2:20:44| Before one big piece was approved last fall, Further West on John Sevier Highway, which would probably be another 135,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8444)|
| 2:20:54| we counted up over 1,150 units, lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8454)|
| 2:20:59| or houses being built that were available about a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8459)|
| 2:21:05| That's more growth than we've had in South Knoxville in the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8465)|
| 2:21:10| So the urgency and the need for this housing only exists in your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8470)|
| 2:21:19| Commissioner Painster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| Yes, this is Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8481)|
| 2:21:25| When was the sector plan implemented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8485)|
| 2:21:30| The last update to the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8490)|
| 2:21:32| No, when was it implemented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8492)|
| 2:21:35| Long before I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| First.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8497)|
| 2:21:38| 1977.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8498)|
| 2:21:39| General plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8499)|
| 2:21:40| First one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8500)|
| 2:21:41| I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| When was the sector plan first implemented in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8503)|
| 2:21:48| We first started using sector plans as a basis for planning back in the probably early 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8508)|
| 2:21:58| Well, be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8518)|
| 2:22:00| First, would you mind explaining why we implemented sector plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8520)|
| 2:22:08| Well, the primary reason we implemented sector plans was it was more of a procedural issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8528)|
| 2:22:15| in that before that the county was divided into approximately 80 small areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8535)|
| 2:22:21| And one of the things we found from a practical standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8541)|
| 2:22:24| it was going to take forever to get all those plans done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8544)|
| 2:22:28| They were primarily only being done in the parts of the county where you were having substantial growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8548)|
| 2:22:33| and you needed some policy guidance fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8553)|
| 2:22:36| The primary reason, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8556)|
| 2:22:38| we found that we needed to look at a little bit larger area as it dealt with transportation issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8558)|
| 2:22:45| as it dealt with utility issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8565)|
| 2:22:47| And so we combined those 80 small areas into the 12 sectors that we use today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8567)|
| 2:22:54| And initially they started out 12 predominant county sectors and 12 predominant city sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8574)|
| 2:23:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8581)|
| 2:23:03| And when you were implementing these, you met with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8583)|
| 2:23:06| and discussed with them what they wanted in their community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8586)|
| 2:23:09| and worked with the people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8589)|
| 2:23:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8591)|
| 2:23:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8592)|
| 2:23:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8593)|
| 2:23:14| Now, you bought up on the north side this medium density residential straight across from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8594)|
| 2:23:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8602)|
| 2:23:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8603)|
| 2:23:25| I believe that was started back in the 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8605)|
| 2:23:30| So that has no bearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8610)|
| 2:23:31| And this was started before the sector plan came in, so that should have no bearing about the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8611)|
| 2:23:36| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8616)|
| 2:23:37| Well, you raise a valid point in that it preceded the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8617)|
| 2:23:41| What we have to do is we've got to look at one of the many things that the staff looks at is existing land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8621)|
| 2:23:48| and existing zoning patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8628)|
| 2:23:51| There's a substantial zoning pattern on the north side of the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8631)|
| 2:23:55| Now, at some point, the sector plan, and granted the zoning is smaller than what the sector plan shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8635)|
| 2:24:02| but at some point it was felt that in recognizing that there was already a medium density zoning in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8642)|
| 2:24:10| up to eight units per acre, that we could not ignore it because of the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8650)|
| 2:24:15| and the location of that particular zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| So that was incorporated into the sector plan as adopted at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8657)|
| 2:24:23| You know, it did precede it, but we have to take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8663)|
| 2:24:27| In some cases, zoning is inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8667)|
| 2:24:31| But in other cases, zoning is inappropriately located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8671)|
| 2:24:37| We try to identify those where we can in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8677)|
| 2:24:42| In other cases, we feel like that even though, you know, we have to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8682)|
| 2:24:51| and work with what we have there in place and build the sector plan around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8691)|
| 2:24:57| Now, if you had to start, and we've talked about this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8697)|
| 2:25:01| if you had to start it with a clean sheet of paper, nothing there, nothing on the ground, a clean sheet of paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8701)|
| 2:25:07| you might not identify the north side for medium density residential, but then again you might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8707)|
| 2:25:13| But you have to identify that that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| What impact might that medium density residential have on future development on opposite sides of the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8716)|
| 2:25:23| Granted, John Sevier is a major highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8723)|
| 2:25:26| It's a state highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8726)|
| 2:25:28| So, you know, we can't ignore the fact that that medium density was in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8728)|
| 2:25:36| and we have to build, try to build a sector plan around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8736)|
| 2:25:41| Well, you didn't ignore it apparently, but you approved low density on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8741)|
| 2:25:50| It was agriculture, and I believe we approved low density when he asked for the five, one to five an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8750)|
| 2:25:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8756)|
| 2:25:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8758)|
| 2:25:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8759)|
| 2:26:00| So why are you coming back and changing, wanting to change this sector plan again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8760)|
| 2:26:04| when it was denied here about eight or nine months ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8764)|
| 2:26:08| And also, Buzz, last year we were told by the MPC that they would revisit the south sector plan in that year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8768)|
| 2:26:18| and you haven't even gotten around to it yet, or we may not be having these problems here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8778)|
| 2:26:25| That was last year sometime, and we're into the sixth month this month, and you haven't gotten to us yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8785)|
| 2:26:33| But these problems are created by MPC, most of them, the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8793)|
| 2:26:40| You haven't done your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8800)|
| 2:26:42| You told us you would be here and revisit the south sector plan, and you haven't done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8802)|
| 2:26:50| Let me speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8810)|
| 2:26:52| Last time when we spoke about that, we said that we would put it in the upcoming year's work program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8812)|
| 2:26:57| and it is in the upcoming year's work program, which starts July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8817)|
| 2:27:02| We have begun collecting data and preparing to implement the public participation part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8822)|
| 2:27:13| but we also have the east county sector plan and the north county sector plan ahead of the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8833)|
| 2:27:19| and we did remind you of that at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8839)|
| 2:27:22| Mark, I know that, but it was in the earlier part of 08 that you said you would get to the south sector plan in 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8842)|
| 2:27:31| As a matter of fact, I believe Mr. Vrees was sitting on commission at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8851)|
| 2:27:34| so it was before September of last year, and you haven't done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8854)|
| 2:27:39| It's in our upcoming work program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8859)|
| 2:27:42| I believe it's July 1st is 09 instead of 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8862)|
| 2:27:49| You told us you would look at it in 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8869)|
| 2:27:53| I tried not to give you a date specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8873)|
| 2:27:56| But you said 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8876)|
| 2:27:57| You didn't give us a date in 08, but you said in 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8877)|
| 2:27:59| It's in our work program for this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| But that's almost a year later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8882)|
| 2:28:04| Well, I caught a lot of heat over this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8884)|
| 2:28:12| I went before the South Oklahoma Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8892)|
| 2:28:15| I was told this plan could work with six condos an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8895)|
| 2:28:20| I got up in front of them down there and told them I was going to support six condos an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8900)|
| 2:28:25| The next thing I know, it's before MPC for nine and a half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8905)|
| 2:28:33| I'm going to have to vote against this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8913)|
| 2:28:36| Commissioner Pinks, do you have a question for the lady?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8916)|
| 2:28:39| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| Ma'am, I can't recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| Both sides have had their time, unless some commissioner wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8923)|
| 2:28:48| I'll recognize her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8928)|
| 2:28:49| Commissioner Norman is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8929)|
| 2:28:51| Yes, I'd like to let this lady speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8931)|
| 2:28:53| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8933)|
| 2:28:56| I'm Beatrice Walters, and I've lived in south Knoxville all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8936)|
| 2:29:01| And I've seen many changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8941)|
| 2:29:04| And my experience with MPC, I had some property that Family Dollar took to them last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8944)|
| 2:29:12| They put it on a year review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8952)|
| 2:29:15| Well, why can't this man bring his back any time he wants to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8955)|
| 2:29:19| I wish you'd answer me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8959)|
| 2:29:21| But I'll tell you about south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8961)|
| 2:29:24| My family, both of my families homesteaded in south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8964)|
| 2:29:30| And so, and John Speer Highway, when they put that turn lane, we have nowhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8970)|
| 2:29:40| And if somebody's right on you, you don't have any place to turn off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8980)|
| 2:29:45| And I'll tell you one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| They have a wreck out there every afternoon and every morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8987)|
| 2:29:51| That's all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8991)|
| 2:29:52| I've been out there 85 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8992)|
| 2:29:54| Ms. B, I'll answer your question about why they're up here every month or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8994)|
| 2:29:59| You can come back every month as long as you come for a different plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8999)|
| 2:30:04| But you can't come back for a single plan for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9004)|
| 2:30:07| But you can come back for one plan this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9007)|
| 2:30:10| If it fails, you can come back for another plan the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9010)|
| 2:30:15| Commissioner Norman, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9015)|
| 2:30:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9017)|
| 2:30:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9018)|
| 2:30:20| I'd just like to make a couple of comments and then ask some questions too from some different folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9020)|
| 2:30:26| I'd like to say something positive for the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9026)|
| 2:30:30| I feel like they're getting bashed around a little bit and quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9030)|
| 2:30:35| And in my role on the task force for hillside development, ridgetop preservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9035)|
| 2:30:44| we found that the MPC is very, very they're essential in the process of helping us do these types of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9044)|
| 2:30:56| which really is the task of that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9056)|
| 2:31:01| And so I greatly appreciate the MPC and I appreciate their work and the staff's expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9061)|
| 2:31:08| and all the things that they do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9068)|
| 2:31:10| And I think they do for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9070)|
| 2:31:12| They do for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9072)|
| 2:31:13| So the things where they're trying to, and as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9073)|
| 2:31:19| Mr. Donaldson is essentially the chair of this sustainable development task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9079)|
| 2:31:26| and Commissioner Saunders is on that with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9086)|
| 2:31:30| And so I think they do really, really good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9090)|
| 2:31:33| And so I want to say that up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9093)|
| 2:31:37| I am greatly respectful of my colleagues from the 9th District, and I hear their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9097)|
| 2:31:50| But there's a couple of things that this hinges on for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9110)|
| 2:31:53| And one, certainly, one question, and I want to address this to the MPC first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9113)|
| 2:31:59| either Buzz or Mark, whoever wants to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9119)|
| 2:32:03| The idea that the sector plan amendments are really invalid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9123)|
| 2:32:10| because they didn't follow proper procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9130)|
| 2:32:15| And so I'd like for them to respond to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9135)|
| 2:32:19| and maybe the law director to respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9139)|
| 2:32:23| But that's a critical question for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9143)|
| 2:32:27| The required public hearing that was mentioned in the Tennessee Code annotated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9147)|
| 2:32:32| was the public hearing that was conducted at the Planning Commission meeting in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9152)|
| 2:32:38| That serves as the required public hearing for a minor plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9158)|
| 2:32:44| Okay, for minor plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9164)|
| 2:32:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9168)|
| 2:32:53| I don't know whether that, I don't know how you'd qualify a minor plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9173)|
| 2:33:02| Mr. Jarrett, do you have any response to the validity of this amendment based on the requirements of sector plan amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9182)|
| 2:33:13| Well, sir, I think the crux of the matter, and I realize this is an emotionally charged issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9193)|
| 2:33:18| the legal issues being raised that need to be resolved that are actually factual in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9198)|
| 2:33:24| The first one was that there's been lack of adequate public notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9204)|
| 2:33:28| and clearly that's an infirmity that has been raised and needs to be overcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9208)|
| 2:33:34| The MPC's own guidelines under Article 9, Section 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9214)|
| 2:33:39| read that staff review and all reports shall incorporate the results of one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9219)|
| 2:33:44| or more public hearings on all applications for and then item F is amendments to any sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9224)|
| 2:33:49| So you have to be satisfied that there was, in fact, adequate public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9229)|
| 2:33:54| The second issue that is both legal and factual is whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9234)|
| 2:33:57| or not they comported with the requirements of the Tennessee Scenic Highway Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9237)|
| 2:34:02| There are essentially five criterion, any one of which would satisfy compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9242)|
| 2:34:09| and I'll read them only because they're very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9249)|
| 2:34:12| Number one is provide for the recovery and conservation of natural scenic beauty along designated scenic highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9252)|
| 2:34:18| Number two, provide a safe and attractive environment for tourists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9258)|
| 2:34:21| and travelers to enjoy the scenic beauty of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9261)|
| 2:34:24| Number three, maximize the potential of little used and bypassed sections of highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9264)|
| 2:34:30| Number four, return economic viability to distressed areas through the promotion of tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9270)|
| 2:34:34| And number five, provide for preservation of routes of historical significance in urban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9274)|
| 2:34:39| and rural areas of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9279)|
| 2:34:42| Over the years that I've litigated land use matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9282)|
| 2:34:44| usually only one party leaves happy and these usually end up in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9284)|
| 2:34:48| But if the board is satisfied that there has been due process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9288)|
| 2:34:52| that there has been adequate public hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9292)|
| 2:34:54| and that the plan does comport with the scenic highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9294)|
| 2:34:58| then the only decision you'll have to make from there is whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9298)|
| 2:35:01| or not you feel it's compatible with the surrounding community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9301)|
| 2:35:04| But, again, the allegations have been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9304)|
| 2:35:07| and then the burden will shift to the MPC to refute that in terms of the public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9307)|
| 2:35:11| and then compliance with the Scenic Highway Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9311)|
| 2:35:14| So, Mr. Donaldson and Buzz, do you feel threatened at all by the pending suit that could be placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9314)|
| 2:35:26| if this was to go through for the change in the amendment or the amendment to the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9326)|
| 2:35:37| Well, the general plan is fairly specific about the changes of conditions that warrant amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9337)|
| 2:35:44| to the land use plan, and I'll read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9344)|
| 2:35:50| Usually conditions that have changed sufficiently to warrant a rezoning contrary to the plan's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9350)|
| 2:35:55| recommendation should result in an amendment to the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9355)|
| 2:36:00| And this is found on page 60 of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9360)|
| 2:36:02| Administrative procedures are in place to allow the Planning Commission to recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9362)|
| 2:36:06| minor plan amendments accompanied by rezoning applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9366)|
| 2:36:10| The Planning Commission reserves the authority to recommend land use plan changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9370)|
| 2:36:14| based on substantially changed conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9374)|
| 2:36:17| Substantially changed conditions include, and there's four bullet points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9377)|
| 2:36:23| introduction of significant new roads or utilities that were not anticipated in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9383)|
| 2:36:29| and make development more feasible, second bullet point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9389)|
| 2:36:33| an obvious and significant error or omission in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9393)|
| 2:36:37| the third bullet point, changes in government policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9397)|
| 2:36:40| such as a decision to concentrate development in certain areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9400)|
| 2:36:45| and then the fourth bullet point is trends in development, population, or traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9405)|
| 2:36:49| that warrant reconsideration of the original plan proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9409)|
| 2:36:55| The next paragraph is titled, Updating the Plan, and it reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9415)|
| 2:37:00| To remain effective, comprehensive plans must be periodically updated and amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9420)|
| 2:37:06| The Planning Commission will determine the actual schedule for major updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9426)|
| 2:37:09| through annual adoption of the MPC work program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9429)|
| 2:37:15| And it continues on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9435)|
| 2:37:18| So these plans are meant to be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9438)|
| 2:37:21| The plan provides for criteria for making those amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9441)|
| 2:37:25| Staff has cited and the applicant has cited changes of condition that they felt warranted the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9445)|
| 2:37:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9455)|
| 2:37:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9456)|
| 2:37:37| Mr. Durning, one question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9457)|
| 2:37:40| Your proposition has stated something about the property has been static for how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9460)|
| 2:37:52| Almost two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9472)|
| 2:37:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9474)|
| 2:37:55| So what did you do as, you know, you did a clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9475)|
| 2:38:00| You had a clearing and grading permit, and you graded the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9480)|
| 2:38:05| When we started the project, we had gone ahead and put in all of the initial stormwater controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9485)|
| 2:38:10| Originally, when the site was moving forward, it was going to be a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9490)|
| 2:38:15| we were going to implement a T-deck demonstration site on stormwater management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9495)|
| 2:38:22| and low impact development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9502)|
| 2:38:24| So all of the stormwater controls, the double ponding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9504)|
| 2:38:27| were originally put in at the beginning of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9507)|
| 2:38:29| It was during that construction time that we found out that the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9509)|
| 2:38:34| that the improvements were going to be made to the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9514)|
| 2:38:36| and the extra sewer capacity would be coming available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9516)|
| 2:38:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9519)|
| 2:38:40| And how are those stormwater controls holding up right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9520)|
| 2:38:44| Well, they're going to need to be worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9524)|
| 2:38:48| They have to be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9528)|
| 2:38:49| We were on a quarterly maintenance schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9529)|
| 2:38:51| Unfortunately, the March time period got missed in some confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9531)|
| 2:38:57| but the bottom line is all those issues are going to be addressed and fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9537)|
| 2:39:00| We have never allowed, and there never has been, an incident on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9540)|
| 2:39:03| that has allowed dirty water off the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9543)|
| 2:39:06| The adjoining, directly across Winkle Creek, I believe is the name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9546)|
| 2:39:10| directly across Winkle Creek is an eight and a half acre barren piece of agriculturally zoned land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9550)|
| 2:39:17| that you can see in aerial photos anytime you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9557)|
| 2:39:20| because it's been stripped absolutely red clay bare for almost three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9560)|
| 2:39:25| It was stripped while we were working on our project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9565)|
| 2:39:28| It has never been repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9568)|
| 2:39:29| It has no self-fencing that's maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9569)|
| 2:39:32| And that's what has caused problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9572)|
| 2:39:34| But it's agriculturally zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9574)|
| 2:39:35| and there's nothing that anybody can do to stop this gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9575)|
| 2:39:38| from allowing his property to remain like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9578)|
| 2:39:41| That drainage from that property has created issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9581)|
| 2:39:45| that the South Duel homeowners want to continually attribute to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9585)|
| 2:39:49| They have made every effort to attribute it to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9589)|
| 2:39:52| but we're not guilty in any possible way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9592)|
| 2:39:54| So you've not had any violations or citations from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9594)|
| 2:39:58| We've had no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9598)|
| 2:40:01| Victoria DeFreeze was out on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9601)|
| 2:40:04| She got some people from Knox County Stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9604)|
| 2:40:08| And just as a point of reference, Victoria's got my phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9608)|
| 2:40:11| She's got my email, but never once asked to go on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9611)|
| 2:40:14| We would have been happy to have allowed her to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9614)|
| 2:40:16| but she decided she wanted to trespass with Knox County Stormwater people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9616)|
| 2:40:20| to show what was being wrong with the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9620)|
| 2:40:26| And, again, those were her views as to what was wrong with the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9626)|
| 2:40:30| And the issue with Knox County was, and correctly so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9630)|
| 2:40:34| that we've got maintenance issues that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9634)|
| 2:40:37| They correctly issued a notice of violation giving us time to get the issues fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9637)|
| 2:40:40| because we're not endangering anybody else's property except our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9640)|
| 2:40:47| In one way of looking at it, we're being fined for having a dirty room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9647)|
| 2:40:50| and we have to clean our own room up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9650)|
| 2:40:52| But that's what we're in the process of getting done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9652)|
| 2:40:54| You're in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9654)|
| 2:40:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9655)|
| 2:40:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9656)|
| 2:40:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9657)|
| 2:41:00| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9660)|
| 2:41:03| I've got some questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9663)|
| 2:41:06| Let's start with the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9666)|
| 2:41:08| Mark and Buzz, can MPC change the sector plan in between?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9668)|
| 2:41:17| Can commissioners change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9677)|
| 2:41:21| Let me address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9681)|
| 2:41:25| In June of 2008, there was signed into law a public chapter 1150,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9685)|
| 2:41:30| which changed the plan amendment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9690)|
| 2:41:35| It provides for two methods to amend the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9695)|
| 2:41:39| which is the land use plan is a component of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9699)|
| 2:41:43| Sector plans are a component of the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9703)|
| 2:41:48| Effectively, they have placed the planning commission back in a recommending role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9708)|
| 2:41:55| The key language is once the planning commission has adopted and certified a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9715)|
| 2:42:00| and the legislative body has adopted that plan, then to amend the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9720)|
| 2:42:05| the planning commission may adopt an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9725)|
| 2:42:09| and certify that amendment to the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9729)|
| 2:42:12| and then, and only after the legislative body approves it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9732)|
| 2:42:16| does that amendment become effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9736)|
| 2:42:19| I guess let me be a little more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9739)|
| 2:42:21| If you're having an MPC meeting and something comes up and it's not inside the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9741)|
| 2:42:27| can MPC commissioners vote the other way and that item still pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9747)|
| 2:42:31| and that project still go through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9751)|
| 2:42:36| Only the legislative body can amend the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9756)|
| 2:42:40| And is that MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9760)|
| 2:42:43| Who are you calling the legislative body, us or MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9763)|
| 2:42:45| County commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9765)|
| 2:42:49| Let me try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9769)|
| 2:42:51| We can, if it's an MPC and someone has a zoning request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9771)|
| 2:42:56| we can't consider the zoning request unless, and it's in violation of the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9776)|
| 2:43:03| unless there's a companion sector plan amendment request with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9783)|
| 2:43:09| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9789)|
| 2:43:10| Well, I know when I served on the MPC for eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9790)|
| 2:43:12| there would be people come up before us and say, and groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9792)|
| 2:43:16| groups would come up and say, this is not in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9796)|
| 2:43:18| But the project fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9798)|
| 2:43:20| It fit what needed to go there or that could go there, and it turned out to be really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9800)|
| 2:43:27| And we would change those, and we would vote for them on the MPC, and they would pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9807)|
| 2:43:31| And probably some of them were appealed, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9811)|
| 2:43:33| But that's what I'm getting at, Buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9813)|
| 2:43:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9816)|
| 2:43:38| Back before the chancellor's ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9818)|
| 2:43:41| the planning commission recommended approval of sector plan amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9821)|
| 2:43:46| and recommended approval of rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9826)|
| 2:43:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9829)|
| 2:43:50| Those went forward knowing that the only thing that could change that would affect the sector plan would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9830)|
| 2:43:57| if the zoning were changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9837)|
| 2:43:59| And that's totally up to the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9839)|
| 2:44:02| We can only recommend adoption of a particular zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9842)|
| 2:44:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9845)|
| 2:44:06| Mark or Buzz, either one on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9846)|
| 2:44:08| 2007, 2008, and 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9848)|
| 2:44:10| Give us, if you know, a ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9850)|
| 2:44:12| This may catch you off guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9852)|
| 2:44:14| How many building permits were issued from MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9854)|
| 2:44:18| How many building permits did we have in 2007?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9858)|
| 2:44:21| How's that going compared to what it was a couple of years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9861)|
| 2:44:25| I can't give you specific numbers, but I can give you the trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9865)|
| 2:44:30| Building permits peaked in Knox County in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9870)|
| 2:44:34| And since then, they have declined a little bit each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9874)|
| 2:44:40| Since December of 2008, I think they're tracking at about 60% of the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9880)|
| 2:44:51| So since 2005, how much are we off since 2005?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9891)|
| 2:44:57| I would say, well, if, and these are really round numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9897)|
| 2:45:03| In 2005, there were approximately 4,400 building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9903)|
| 2:45:08| And this year, we're probably looking at 2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9908)|
| 2:45:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9915)|
| 2:45:16| In 06, 07, and 08, there were probably a 10% decline each of those years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9916)|
| 2:45:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9923)|
| 2:45:24| Question to Victor real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9924)|
| 2:45:25| Victor, this has come before several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9925)|
| 2:45:28| At one time, you had said something about a red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9928)|
| 2:45:30| Is the red light still with this or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9930)|
| 2:45:34| A traffic signal is a function of how the overall site would be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9934)|
| 2:45:37| We have done studies which would, with 150 units and a one-acre commercial component as part of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9937)|
| 2:45:45| would justify the warrants to be able to erect a signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9945)|
| 2:45:50| So we know that one is possible, but we can't plan for it at this particular stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9950)|
| 2:45:55| And just as a follow-up on the issue of the permits, there were about 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9955)|
| 2:46:00| In 2005, there were about 5,500 permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9960)|
| 2:46:03| In 2007, it was about 4,300 permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9963)|
| 2:46:06| And last year, it was about 1,500 permits, and they're projecting between 600 and 800 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9966)|
| 2:46:11| The minimum need in Knox County is about 2,000, 2,500 new homes a year to meet existing internal growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9971)|
| 2:46:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9979)|
| 2:46:20| The people that were for this, would you stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9980)|
| 2:46:23| Let me see who you all are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9983)|
| 2:46:27| You may be property owners or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9987)|
| 2:46:29| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9989)|
| 2:46:31| I know Mr. Gatz, I guess he is, and some people related with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9991)|
| 2:46:35| My question is, has any of these homeowners groups come to you and asked your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9995)|
| 2:46:42| See, now, that's where I've got a problem, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10002)|
| 2:46:45| There's a reason why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10005)|
| 2:46:47| I've got the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10007)|
| 2:46:49| When these people, you know, we see this in other parts of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10009)|
| 2:46:54| You know, and we've been on this for years and years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10014)|
| 2:46:57| And when this group does not even come and ask their opinion, it's their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10017)|
| 2:47:07| I don't think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10027)|
| 2:47:10| One last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10030)|
| 2:47:12| Sir, with the Homeowner Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10032)|
| 2:47:14| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10034)|
| 2:47:15| Will you allow me to answer that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10035)|
| 2:47:17| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10037)|
| 2:47:18| I want you and Victor to stand up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10038)|
| 2:47:21| Victor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10041)|
| 2:47:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10042)|
| 2:47:23| Victor, what are you wanting and what do you guys, how far off are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10043)|
| 2:47:27| How can we come to an agreement today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10047)|
| 2:47:29| How far off are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10049)|
| 2:47:31| The issue is, and the reason that we keep coming up with confusion is that we can't reach an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10051)|
| 2:47:42| The issue is that the Southville homeowners did not object to five units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10062)|
| 2:47:48| which was the original plan, which was all I asked to move forward for with the original request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10068)|
| 2:47:53| because there wasn't infrastructure to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10073)|
| 2:47:55| Once the infrastructure became available to do more, I requested more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10075)|
| 2:47:59| The sector plan was changed at MPC and lost to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10079)|
| 2:48:04| I then went back to redo the project exactly as Mike Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10084)|
| 2:48:08| and the other Southville homeowners wanted to do as low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10088)|
| 2:48:11| and they opposed every project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10091)|
| 2:48:13| When Mr. Pinkston was, quite correctly, stood up at the Southville homeowners and said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10093)|
| 2:48:20| he would support six units an acre, there was 30 acres under contract at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10100)|
| 2:48:25| Now there's only 22 acres under contract because we had to drop off the seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10105)|
| 2:48:29| and a half acres because the Southville homeowners were going to object to doing the project that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10109)|
| 2:48:36| So, once again, we had to change the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10116)|
| 2:48:38| We brought it back to the 22 acres because we have not been able to reach any design plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10118)|
| 2:48:43| other than five units an acre under some criteria that the Southville homeowners want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10123)|
| 2:48:47| which is an enormous waste and loss of an asset in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10127)|
| 2:48:52| The point that Mr. Brown made about buying Mr. Gass's property, just as a point of reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10132)|
| 2:48:57| we make every attempt to buy every piece of property that adjoins every development that I've ever done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10137)|
| 2:49:02| We want to control and own what is next to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10142)|
| 2:49:05| It not only creates a buffer for us, but it gives a real assurance to everybody in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10145)|
| 2:49:10| that we have a very vested development structure that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10150)|
| 2:49:15| So we are always buying what adjoins us, if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10155)|
| 2:49:19| The issue is that this property is the exact kind of property that needs to be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10159)|
| 2:49:30| medium-density residential, and the Southville homeowners have meticulously made sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10170)|
| 2:49:35| that no other medium-density property exists in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10175)|
| 2:49:39| And this property, under any development criteria that would move the density up, they have resisted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10179)|
| 2:49:45| So I don't know how we can ever get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10185)|
| 2:49:48| So you've got 22 acres, and you're wanting how many per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10188)|
| 2:49:50| Seven and a half units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10190)|
| 2:49:52| And, sir, what do you want? What do you think is fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10192)|
| 2:49:56| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10196)|
| 2:49:57| The issue to us is the validity of the sector plan as it exists today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10197)|
| 2:50:04| It indicates that low-density residential is appropriate and consistent with the character of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10204)|
| 2:50:10| as it is now and as it should be in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10210)|
| 2:50:15| That's our issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10215)|
| 2:50:17| Mr. Jernigan has made a very clear point that this is the only area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10217)|
| 2:50:22| I don't agree with how he says it got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10222)|
| 2:50:26| But this, according to him, is the only area that can be developed medium-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10226)|
| 2:50:31| So you're all wanting five per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10231)|
| 2:50:33| The point I was going to make, sir, is that why put medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10233)|
| 2:50:39| in the middle of what he admits is low-density residential area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10239)|
| 2:50:43| The sector plan was developed as an overall plan for the good of the community, not an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10243)|
| 2:50:48| And it says that low-density residential is appropriate for the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10248)|
| 2:50:53| Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10253)|
| 2:50:54| We are supporting and have supported since the very beginning five units or less per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10254)|
| 2:51:00| which is consistent with low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10260)|
| 2:51:04| Mr. Jernigan, have they ever said they wanted more or agreed to more than five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10264)|
| 2:51:08| The issue is not the five units an acre because we've moved forward with development plans at five units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10268)|
| 2:51:13| when we were acquiring the adjoining properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10273)|
| 2:51:16| That's where this issue of transfer of development rights came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10276)|
| 2:51:19| That never was occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10279)|
| 2:51:21| They asked us to develop it under low-density residential guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10281)|
| 2:51:24| We moved forward to develop it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10284)|
| 2:51:26| And once we get the project done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10286)|
| 2:51:28| and we have got seven more months invested into the project with more homeowner meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10288)|
| 2:51:33| with banks work, with new engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10293)|
| 2:51:35| they opposed that plan under low-density residential guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10295)|
| 2:51:40| We go back with a different structure, again, to meet their specific request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10300)|
| 2:51:44| And once again, after Mr. Pinkston was nice enough to stand and speak in favor of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10304)|
| 2:51:49| other people in the South Duel homeowner group began a very strong campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10309)|
| 2:51:53| which said that they were going to oppose that plan also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10313)|
| 2:51:57| Also, again, under low-density development standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10317)|
| 2:52:00| There has not been any plan put forward in which the South Duel homeowners have negotiated in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10320)|
| 2:52:05| in my opinion, on any part of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10325)|
| 2:52:07| They have not opposed to low-density residential because they have no basis to oppose to the low-density residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10327)|
| 2:52:13| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10333)|
| 2:52:14| The sector plan is a design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10334)|
| 2:52:19| And just as a moment, if I may, the issue is this is what homeowners want in their area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10339)|
| 2:52:25| And everybody has a vision of how they want their area to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10345)|
| 2:52:29| at the detriment to some other part of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10349)|
| 2:52:32| The job of the MPC staff and the MPC commission is to look holistically at the entire county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10352)|
| 2:52:39| and say how does the entire county move forward to be a better place for everyone to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10359)|
| 2:52:45| Sector plans are amended as a regular course of business when substantial changes have occurred in an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10365)|
| 2:52:51| And what happened in South Knoxville was a substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10371)|
| 2:52:55| Otherwise, we would have moved the plan forward as medium-density residential to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10375)|
| 2:53:00| The issue, and we have since tried to work with revising plans, revising densities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10380)|
| 2:53:05| revising structures that would allow everybody to have a win,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10385)|
| 2:53:08| to be able to have a project that correctly uses the land, that has correct stormwater controls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10388)|
| 2:53:12| that has correct clustering of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10392)|
| 2:53:15| And none of those plans have ever met with favor from South Dwell homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10395)|
| 2:53:19| The regimen is that they have eliminated, again, when the sector plan was originally done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10399)|
| 2:53:27| there was 120 acres of land approximately approved low-density residential, 50 acres, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10407)|
| 2:53:33| approved low-density residential at five units an acre, and 75 acres approved for medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10413)|
| 2:53:39| There wasn't any need for more medium-density residential land in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10419)|
| 2:53:44| But the sector plan was adopted with those zonings in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10424)|
| 2:53:49| The South Dwell Homeowners Association voted to change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10429)|
| 2:53:53| They wanted the sector plan changed to allow the Walmart to come in and the Home Depot to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10433)|
| 2:53:58| to allow the Lowe's to come in and destroy the opportunities for medium-density residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10438)|
| 2:54:03| They had no problem with supporting that sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10443)|
| 2:54:06| They overwhelmingly supported those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10446)|
| 2:54:09| But they don't want the opportunity to have this sector plan changed because this doesn't meet, for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10449)|
| 2:54:14| the criteria that they've established to say that this could be something we don't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10454)|
| 2:54:19| They got rid of medium-density residential and allowed big-box retail to move in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10459)|
| 2:54:23| and the thousands of jobs that it has created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10463)|
| 2:54:27| One last thing that I wanted to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10467)|
| 2:54:30| Excuse me, just one point, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10470)|
| 2:54:32| We keep hearing about these 4,000 or 5,000 jobs that are coming into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10472)|
| 2:54:36| We don't know where those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10476)|
| 2:54:38| We have contacted each of the companies in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10478)|
| 2:54:42| In fact, not just the Lowe's area, but all around the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10482)|
| 2:54:46| And we come up with maybe 800 jobs, not new jobs, existing jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10486)|
| 2:54:53| Lowe's was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10493)|
| 2:54:54| It's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10494)|
| 2:54:55| Walmart has been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10495)|
| 2:54:56| Food City moved a quarter of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10496)|
| 2:54:59| Goodies came and went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10499)|
| 2:55:02| We don't see the jobs, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10502)|
| 2:55:04| And one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10504)|
| 2:55:05| As far as the Homeowners Association, it is not a closed society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10505)|
| 2:55:10| It is not a closed group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10510)|
| 2:55:12| We are absolutely open in inviting anybody and everybody in the community that has any interest in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10512)|
| 2:55:18| to be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10518)|
| 2:55:20| We always have and we always will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10520)|
| 2:55:22| In fact, Mr. Jernigan is a member of the South Dole Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10522)|
| 2:55:27| I've been to your meetings, but have you sat down with those homeowners over there, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10527)|
| 2:55:31| Have you personally sat with Mr. Gass's house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10531)|
| 2:55:34| I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10534)|
| 2:55:35| I have not personally sat with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10535)|
| 2:55:36| One day it might be your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10536)|
| 2:55:38| Mr. Donaldson, quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10538)|
| 2:55:40| Do you think this is a good project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10540)|
| 2:55:44| Staff supported the amendment to the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10544)|
| 2:55:47| and the requested zoning is consistent with that plan amendment if it were to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10547)|
| 2:55:56| One of the key tenets in land use planning is to tie your land uses to your transportation network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10556)|
| 2:56:03| We have a significant arterial road through east-west through south Knoxville, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10563)|
| 2:56:11| and that is an appropriate place to put more intense uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10571)|
| 2:56:16| We've been working with this for years and years and years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10576)|
| 2:56:19| and it seems to be holding development up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10579)|
| 2:56:22| These people want to sell their land, want to do something with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10582)|
| 2:56:25| and I'd like to see something positive come out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10585)|
| 2:56:28| We've really struggled with it for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10588)|
| 2:56:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10591)|
| 2:56:33| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10593)|
| 2:56:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10595)|
| 2:56:37| I want to address several issues from a legal standpoint, first of all, on this public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10597)|
| 2:56:44| MPC folks, according to your rules, you require a 12-day notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10604)|
| 2:56:48| if it's just something that comes on your regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10608)|
| 2:56:51| But your rules say on the sector plan change, to me it's kind of vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10611)|
| 2:56:57| It just says that there will be one or more public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10617)|
| 2:57:01| So you said that the public hearing was during the regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10621)|
| 2:57:05| Did I understand that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10625)|
| 2:57:07| Is that the standard procedure that you have your public hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10627)|
| 2:57:10| And can you tell me when was that noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10630)|
| 2:57:12| so that people would know that there was a public hearing the day of your meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10632)|
| 2:57:16| It was noticed more than 30 days prior to the meeting because of a change in law in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10636)|
| 2:57:23| which set a 30-day time frame for the public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10643)|
| 2:57:29| Is that for everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10649)|
| 2:57:30| For plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10650)|
| 2:57:32| Okay, so you sent that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10652)|
| 2:57:33| It was noticed 30 days, and it was in the general circulation of record and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10653)|
| 2:57:38| Secondly, on this scenic highway, was it or is it in compliance with the scenic highway regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10658)|
| 2:57:50| They're saying it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10670)|
| 2:57:51| I'm wanting your.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| The section of the scenic highway law that Mr. Jarrett read from is from the standards and objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10673)|
| 2:58:02| There are two sections that refer to zoning-like regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10682)|
| 2:58:08| One is 54-17-108, which says that whenever a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10688)|
| 2:58:13| or highway has been designated part of the system, it is unlawful for any person to construct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10693)|
| 2:58:18| use, operate, or maintain any advertising structure that's a billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10698)|
| 2:58:23| or junkyard within 2,000 feet of any road or highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10703)|
| 2:58:28| We're not dealing with either of those two things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10708)|
| 2:58:31| And there also is a provision, if I can find it, at 54-17-115.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10711)|
| 2:58:43| The paragraph's titled Building Restrictions Near Scenic Highways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10723)|
| 2:58:49| and it says the exposed portion of buildings constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10729)|
| 2:58:52| or erected on property located within 1,000 feet of a scenic highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10732)|
| 2:58:56| shall not exceed a height of 35 feet above the level of highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10736)|
| 2:59:01| or a height of 35 feet above ground line on property located above the level of such a highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10741)|
| 2:59:08| Those are the fairly limited zoning-like provisions of the scenic highway law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10748)|
| 2:59:16| So those were taken into consideration when you were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10756)|
| 2:59:19| Well, we haven't seen a development plan yet for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10759)|
| 2:59:23| At that time, we would check on the height limitation requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10763)|
| 2:59:29| Who's the attorney for MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10769)|
| 2:59:31| Steve Wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10771)|
| 2:59:33| Also, about the sufficient grounds for the sector plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10773)|
| 2:59:39| the suggestion was made that perhaps there's not sufficient grounds for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10779)|
| 2:59:45| that when the sector plan amendment was changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10785)|
| 2:59:47| there wasn't sufficient, I guess, documentation to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10787)|
| 2:59:53| Well, I read into the record the paragraphs relating to changes of conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10793)|
| 2:59:58| warranting amendment of the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10798)|
| 3:00:01| Staff in their report referred to items about logical extension on existing zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10801)|
| 3:00:07| or development patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10807)|
| 3:00:09| Mr. Jernigan, the applicant, introduced evidence about changes of utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10809)|
| 3:00:15| and changes in trends of development in the area that would warrant reconsideration of the original plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10815)|
| 3:00:24| So in your view, that was all that was necessary for it, I mean, as far as the grounds for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10824)|
| 3:00:32| A couple of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10832)|
| 3:00:33| First of all, about the sector plan, Joe Jarrett, our law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10833)|
| 3:00:38| a question for you here, our assistant law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10838)|
| 3:00:42| The Fensler ruling with regards to sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10842)|
| 3:00:46| is it properly before us today to take a look at a change in sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10846)|
| 3:00:50| or should we ignore that portion of it with the Fensler ruling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10850)|
| 3:00:57| Well, I mean, at this juncture, we'd have to just take this own case on its merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10857)|
| 3:01:01| So that's really the only thing that's properly before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10861)|
| 3:01:05| So the only thing that's proper before us is, again, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10865)|
| 3:01:11| Until this matter that you're currently reviewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10871)|
| 3:01:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10873)|
| 3:01:14| But as far as the sector plan itself, I mean, I guess I'm looking at the Chancellor Fensler ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10874)|
| 3:01:19| and they're saying that the Chancellor Fensler ruling said only MPC could do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10879)|
| 3:01:22| that it shouldn't even be brought before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10882)|
| 3:01:24| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10884)|
| 3:01:26| Yeah, I mean, I think that state law requires that we're the ultimate decision maker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10886)|
| 3:01:32| I say we, the commission, is the ultimate arbiter of fact here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10892)|
| 3:01:39| Mr. Donaldson, did you, I mean, first of all, do you agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10899)|
| 3:01:44| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10904)|
| 3:01:45| In June of 2008, a new law was signed into effect, public chapter 1150,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10905)|
| 3:01:51| which amended the regional planning process, which created two methods to amend the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10911)|
| 3:01:59| One is through an initiative of the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10919)|
| 3:02:04| but it is operative only upon approval by the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10924)|
| 3:02:08| That's the county commission in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10928)|
| 3:02:11| The other method is through an initiative of the county commission itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10931)|
| 3:02:16| whereby the county commission can initiate a plan amendment, send it to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10936)|
| 3:02:20| and then consider it for approval to make it operative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10940)|
| 3:02:26| So this law has changed since the court case to clarify that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10946)|
| 3:02:35| Did you, Mr. Donaldson, the allegation was made that you worked with the developer to, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10955)|
| 3:02:41| get around something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10961)|
| 3:02:45| Did you have meetings with him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10965)|
| 3:02:46| Did you provide counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10966)|
| 3:02:48| Because that's a conflict of interest if you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10968)|
| 3:02:51| As a staff member, it's my job to advise anybody that walks up to the counter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10971)|
| 3:02:57| But did you advise them to get around the rules and regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10977)|
| 3:03:00| We advise them of all of the processes that are available to anybody that comes to our desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10980)|
| 3:03:09| We try to make no judgments about any outcomes that could be expected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10989)|
| 3:03:16| but we do provide advice to anybody who makes application on what the proper processes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=10996)|
| 3:03:22| You say proper processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11002)|
| 3:03:23| but to get around a rule to do something that might be considered untoward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11003)|
| 3:03:31| I would have to know some specifics there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11011)|
| 3:03:37| Specifics, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11017)|
| 3:03:39| You want me to restate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11019)|
| 3:03:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11021)|
| 3:03:42| I mean, I don't like what I'm hearing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11022)|
| 3:03:44| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11024)|
| 3:03:48| I got it on good authority that he advised Mr. Jernigan the way to get around the zoning that he wanted there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11028)|
| 3:03:56| was to bring these others in under what we look at, some of us, as transfer development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11036)|
| 3:04:02| And while I've got the floor, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11042)|
| 3:04:04| Mr. Smith would not call on me to answer his question, but I think the other 18 of you need to know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11044)|
| 3:04:11| Our attorney advised us not to contact the neighbors because they all had been contacted, we heard, by Mr. Jernigan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11051)|
| 3:04:19| and had supposedly made some kind of deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11059)|
| 3:04:21| So we could not contact them without we would have been in violation of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11061)|
| 3:04:26| So that's why we did not contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11066)|
| 3:04:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11068)|
| 3:04:29| Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11069)|
| 3:04:31| I don't think it was my idea to include a larger area of land and cluster the development onto a smaller site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11071)|
| 3:04:40| No, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11080)|
| 3:04:41| And candidly, even the thought or the implication of that is really stretching credulity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11081)|
| 3:04:49| It's so far from how this thing has moved forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11089)|
| 3:04:53| The goal of acquiring the adjoining properties and the issue got to be, and it is a technical issue, Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11093)|
| 3:05:01| is that I acquired the other seven and a half acres along Tipton Station Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11101)|
| 3:05:06| or I was going to be acquiring the other properties on Tipton Station Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11106)|
| 3:05:09| and it was acquired at a different time than the original property had been acquired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11109)|
| 3:05:13| And they were going to be joining the subdivision subsequent to the rezoning and the filing of the plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11113)|
| 3:05:21| That type of rezoning, that type of structure, is done all over the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11121)|
| 3:05:27| It did turn out that it was the first time that I had decided that I would move it forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11127)|
| 3:05:32| another one of those great opportunities about being a pioneer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11132)|
| 3:05:35| It is what establishes low-density residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11135)|
| 3:05:39| It does exactly what the neighborhood wants to be done, and it allows them to join the subdivision, be part of the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11139)|
| 3:05:46| have the restrictions of the subdivision and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11146)|
| 3:05:49| It's just that they do it after the overall plan is put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11149)|
| 3:05:53| That was the question that I did ask to Mr. Donaldson was would I need to file a new subdivision plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11153)|
| 3:06:02| a new rezoning plan once I rezone the seven-and-a-half acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11162)|
| 3:06:05| Would I have to file another plan, another rezoning to tie all the properties together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11165)|
| 3:06:10| And he said that I would have to file a new subdivision, a new rezoning plan to tie all of the properties together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11170)|
| 3:06:17| That's the same advice he would give to anybody because that's the way that the MPC regulations read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11177)|
| 3:06:24| The concept of him advising me on how to do something or how to proceed on something is I categorically, emphatically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11184)|
| 3:06:34| and without equivocation say that that never happened, nor would I allow a staff member who wouldn't bet three big dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11194)|
| 3:06:40| would whip a little one to tell me how to spend my money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11200)|
| 3:06:44| Are you going to put apartments or condos on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11204)|
| 3:06:46| The goal has been to put condos on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11206)|
| 3:06:48| We believe we have an excellent plan for condominiums on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11208)|
| 3:06:51| We have a type of condo that we think will be extremely successful in this market area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11211)|
| 3:06:55| And the goal has been to put condos on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11215)|
| 3:06:57| The neighborhood, when we moved forward with the larger zoning originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11217)|
| 3:07:03| and the sector plan was amended originally, we were going to build apartments on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11223)|
| 3:07:08| There are no market rate apartments in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11228)|
| 3:07:11| They would be phenomenally successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11231)|
| 3:07:13| But we did not win a county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11233)|
| 3:07:16| The South Knoxville, Bob, Victoria came and said, well, we will not oppose low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11236)|
| 3:07:22| That's when we went back, acquired the seven and a half acres, and we started all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11242)|
| 3:07:28| They wanted condominiums, and so we changed the plan back to just build condos on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11248)|
| 3:07:32| You're willing to go with five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11252)|
| 3:07:34| No, are you willing to go with five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11254)|
| 3:07:35| We can't make the transaction work at five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11255)|
| 3:07:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11258)|
| 3:07:39| So that's just basically off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11259)|
| 3:07:40| That's which is the reason we've gone to medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11260)|
| 3:07:43| and was approved at MPC for the second time with a completely different MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11263)|
| 3:07:48| Did you go with six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11268)|
| 3:07:49| We were at nine units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11269)|
| 3:07:52| The six units an acre on the 30 acres that Mr. Pinkston, Commissioner Pinkston, spoke about approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11272)|
| 3:07:59| works out to be 7.72 units per acre approximately on the overall site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11279)|
| 3:08:06| The seven and a half acres allows us to do the plan that we have moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11286)|
| 3:08:10| and the one we believe is financeable in this market environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11290)|
| 3:08:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11293)|
| 3:08:14| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11294)|
| 3:08:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11295)|
| 3:08:16| May I say something here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11296)|
| 3:08:17| Mr. Jarnigan, the seven and a half acres was the acres that you were getting with the development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11297)|
| 3:08:22| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11302)|
| 3:08:24| It's the land that we were going to be purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11304)|
| 3:08:26| Purchasing with the development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11306)|
| 3:08:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11308)|
| 3:08:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11309)|
| 3:08:30| But eventually we were going to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11310)|
| 3:08:31| When I'd spoken with you previously, I'll just make sure we're clear on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11311)|
| 3:08:35| is that the first issue was they were going to be joining the subdivision after the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11315)|
| 3:08:40| and that became this issue of transfer of development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11320)|
| 3:08:43| The second time that we moved forward, the properties were being put under contract to purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11323)|
| 3:08:47| and they were just going to be purchased and made part of the subdivision on day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11327)|
| 3:08:51| That's how that plan was beginning to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11331)|
| 3:08:53| That's when I talked to you again about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11333)|
| 3:08:54| That's when we moved forward with making sure that we had financing to do this approximately 170 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11334)|
| 3:09:00| on the property, and that's where that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11340)|
| 3:09:04| The development rights had already been refused here at this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11344)|
| 3:09:07| We turned it down and asked it to go back for a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11347)|
| 3:09:10| And you came to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11350)|
| 3:09:11| And we went back to buy the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11351)|
| 3:09:13| When you came to me, you said you could make it work on the second night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11353)|
| 3:09:17| Well, if you bought the property, why aren't the people selling it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11357)|
| 3:09:20| Because that requires that we withdrew the opportunity to purchase the property because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11360)|
| 3:09:27| South Duel Homeowners Association bombarded the banks and other people with the fact that they were going to oppose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11367)|
| 3:09:32| that project again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11372)|
| 3:09:34| They were going to oppose the acquisition of the property if we were to cluster the development on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11374)|
| 3:09:39| So the bank withdrew its support, saying that the South Duel homeowners were going to oppose that project also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11379)|
| 3:09:44| That left us with no alternative but to come back and move the project forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11384)|
| 3:09:47| back to what had previously been approved at MPC for medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11387)|
| 3:09:53| The MPC's original recommendation at 12 units an acre would not have complied with the Scenic Parkway Standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11393)|
| 3:10:01| because it was they would have been three-story buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11401)|
| 3:10:04| which would be above the height restriction that you can have within the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11404)|
| 3:10:09| That made it easy to go back, relook at the plan, and we came back with a plan for the condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11409)|
| 3:10:14| I believe you correct me if I'm wrong, Buzz, but if you had bought this property and came up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11414)|
| 3:10:20| we have nothing to do about clustering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11420)|
| 3:10:23| I mean, that happens every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11423)|
| 3:10:24| It just means if you've got 20 acres and you get five an acre, you can build those five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11424)|
| 3:10:30| I mean those 50 on 10 acres of that 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11430)|
| 3:10:33| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11433)|
| 3:10:34| So I don't understand why the South Duel Homeowners Association would be fighting clustering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11434)|
| 3:10:39| because as many times they've been up here, they would know the difference, Mr. Jarnigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11439)|
| 3:10:44| I was at a specific meeting, and speaking of South Duel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11444)|
| 3:10:47| and I'd be happy if they allowed video, we would be able to show you the video of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11447)|
| 3:10:51| where I took the boards up and showed how the development would be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11451)|
| 3:10:55| with 150 single-family detached homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11455)|
| 3:10:58| and what it would look like if all the development was clustered on the 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11458)|
| 3:11:04| That meeting was specifically the one that generated the responses back to the people that I report to now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11464)|
| 3:11:11| or I work with now, my partners in the banks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11471)|
| 3:11:14| and they have made it really clear that they were going to be opposed to any clustering of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11474)|
| 3:11:20| on any structure that involved buying the property on Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11480)|
| 3:11:24| The way I understood it, they were against the development rights because we had no guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11484)|
| 3:11:27| This had never been done, and we asked MPC to give us guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11487)|
| 3:11:31| And even though that and that's what caused the confusion in the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11491)|
| 3:11:37| which was the reason it went back to MPC, which was the reason we went back to acquire the adjoining property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11497)|
| 3:11:42| And that was after we had the homeowner meeting in South Oil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11502)|
| 3:11:46| That's when they came back out and said, we don't want clustering of any kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11506)|
| 3:11:49| It's a ruse to have apartments or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11509)|
| 3:11:51| And they were opposing the project on buying the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11511)|
| 3:11:53| Well, when I said that I would go with six condos an acre, my understanding was it was on the 22 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11513)|
| 3:12:01| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11521)|
| 3:12:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11524)|
| 3:12:05| Well, first of all, I want to clear up a couple of things, and I've been very quiet today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11525)|
| 3:12:12| You know, it was said earlier that the Constitution said you could do what you wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11532)|
| 3:12:17| provided it wasn't uncomfortable for your neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11537)|
| 3:12:20| I read the Constitution, and I don't see that anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11540)|
| 3:12:24| It was also said that the homeowners association could not contact these neighbors, and that is also completely untrue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11544)|
| 3:12:35| Any attorney that would suggest that does not understand the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11555)|
| 3:12:40| because you have a right to contact anybody that you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11560)|
| 3:12:44| It's called free speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11564)|
| 3:12:45| It's living in a free country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11565)|
| 3:12:48| Now, I believe that when a development goes in, that the stakeholders, the folks that live close by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11568)|
| 3:12:54| should have some sort of say in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11574)|
| 3:12:57| I believe that property rights should be upheld, but that there should be some consideration to the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11577)|
| 3:13:04| I'm going to ask a question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11584)|
| 3:13:06| I'd like to see a show of hands of how many folks that are in this audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11586)|
| 3:13:10| that live within a half a mile of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11590)|
| 3:13:18| So we look about even of the direct neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11598)|
| 3:13:21| They're about even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11601)|
| 3:13:22| Part of them are for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11602)|
| 3:13:23| Part of them are against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11603)|
| 3:13:25| That does not look to me like overwhelming opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11605)|
| 3:13:28| What I do see is I see a lot of folks that may live two or three miles away that are opposing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11608)|
| 3:13:35| And I don't think that's quite close enough to where it would make you a stakeholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11615)|
| 3:13:41| I'm going to support this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11621)|
| 3:13:43| I've seen Mr. Jernigan's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11623)|
| 3:13:45| There is not a subdivision or condo development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11625)|
| 3:13:50| There's nothing that this man has built that I would not be proud to live very close to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11630)|
| 3:13:56| And I think that once this is built, once this is finished, that you folks will be proud to live close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11636)|
| 3:14:04| Commissioner Luttrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11644)|
| 3:14:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11646)|
| 3:14:07| Victor, Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11647)|
| 3:14:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11652)|
| 3:14:13| Are these condos for rent or for sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11653)|
| 3:14:16| They're going to be for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11656)|
| 3:14:18| And how many bedrooms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11658)|
| 3:14:19| I mean, what size units are these going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11659)|
| 3:14:23| The plan is to build a condominium development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11663)|
| 3:14:26| It's called the Big House Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11666)|
| 3:14:28| It's designed by a company called Humphreys and Partners out of Houston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11668)|
| 3:14:32| It's the only trademarked architectural plan in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11672)|
| 3:14:37| It is one of the most sought-after designs in the most difficult areas of the country to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11677)|
| 3:14:42| And the reason I'm saying that in the areas where density is truly abhorrent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11682)|
| 3:14:49| they've allowed this type of building to get built in the neighborhood because it looks like a large house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11689)|
| 3:14:55| The buildings are comprised of one-bedroom, two-bedroom, and three-bedroom condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11695)|
| 3:15:02| The one-bedroom units will be approximately 700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11702)|
| 3:15:05| We're not finalizing the designs, but about 750 square feet, not less than 700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11705)|
| 3:15:12| The two-bedroom units will be between 950 and 1,050, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11712)|
| 3:15:17| And the three-bedroom units will be about 1,350 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11717)|
| 3:15:22| The price point is going to be about $120 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11722)|
| 3:15:26| That compares to an average sale price in all of South Knoxville of about $95 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11726)|
| 3:15:31| The one-bedroom units, there are no one-bedroom units available in the greater South Knoxville area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11731)|
| 3:15:38| and for that matter, most of Knoxville that would be considered market rate or luxury units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11738)|
| 3:15:44| The units will sell, the one-bedroom homes will sell for about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11744)|
| 3:15:49| condominiums will sell for about $87,000, $88,000 each, and you can do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11749)|
| 3:15:54| The three-bedroom units will be about $155,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11754)|
| 3:15:59| What would be the makeup of percentages of one, two, and three bedrooms, about a third each?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11759)|
| 3:16:05| It depends on how the overall unit mix works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11765)|
| 3:16:10| We think there's a need for between 35 and 40 one-bedroom units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11770)|
| 3:16:13| These are especially good to design with universal design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11773)|
| 3:16:19| and accessibility features where people who are currently living in the area in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11779)|
| 3:16:24| want to remain in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11784)|
| 3:16:26| More importantly, family members who don't live in South Knoxville, live somewhere else, live out of state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11786)|
| 3:16:31| want to move to be close to family, provides that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11791)|
| 3:16:35| I've not done the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11795)|
| 3:16:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11796)|
| 3:16:37| So what percentage would that be of the total units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11797)|
| 3:16:40| Approximately 20 to 25 percent would be one-bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11800)|
| 3:16:46| It might wind up being 30 percent one-bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11806)|
| 3:16:48| It just depends on how we see the demographic mix as we're moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11808)|
| 3:16:51| because there are a lot of seniors in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11811)|
| 3:16:54| There will be fewer three-bedroom units because three-bedroom units tend to attract more families and teenage drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11814)|
| 3:17:02| and we really see this as a situation where there will be more young professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11822)|
| 3:17:08| more people who are moving into the area, more young couples that are moving into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11828)|
| 3:17:12| So there will be some three-bedrooms, but not that many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11832)|
| 3:17:15| Probably about 10 to 15 percent will be three-bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11835)|
| 3:17:18| Let me ask you this, because Commissioner Smith sort of got aimed this way a little bit as far as a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11838)|
| 3:17:24| You know, we're talking about a difference of two-and-a-half units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11844)|
| 3:17:28| So if we split it, that would be 6.25 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11848)|
| 3:17:32| I'm prepared to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11852)|
| 3:17:35| Could you live with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11855)|
| 3:17:36| Commissioner, I really do appreciate the offer very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11856)|
| 3:17:39| but we started with a preliminary site plan that was at nine units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11859)|
| 3:17:44| The comparable density was, as I said, 7.725.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11864)|
| 3:17:50| We started with nine for a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11870)|
| 3:17:53| We agreed to seven-and-a-half at NBC Commission to reach a compromise that we thought would make everybody satisfied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11873)|
| 3:17:59| and give us what would have amounted to about six units an acre across the entire 30-acre site now that we have 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11879)|
| 3:18:05| So the mathematics just don't work for the extra unit-and-a-half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11885)|
| 3:18:10| So you would rather me vote against the seven-and-a-half than vote for a 6.25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11890)|
| 3:18:15| There's no benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11895)|
| 3:18:18| We can't afford the redesign and the reimplementation of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11898)|
| 3:18:21| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11901)|
| 3:18:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11902)|
| 3:18:25| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11905)|
| 3:18:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11910)|
| 3:18:33| Gosh, we've listened to this for almost two hours now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11913)|
| 3:18:38| It seems we're going in a circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11918)|
| 3:18:41| I personally favor more dense development, more cluster development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11921)|
| 3:18:47| and as I'm involved in things that project the growth in this county over the next 10 to 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11927)|
| 3:18:54| we're going to have to do some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11934)|
| 3:18:56| We're going to have to do a lot of that if we're going to maintain any vacant or any farm property at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11936)|
| 3:19:04| As Mark Donaldson said, the transportation corridors are critical to this kind of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11944)|
| 3:19:11| and you are on a corridor that is very important, Chapman Highway, et cetera, and Governor John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11951)|
| 3:19:24| Commissioner Smith's request and observations about the neighbors talking and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11964)|
| 3:19:32| I regret that the attorneys, and sometimes attorneys, bless their hearts, can get in the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11972)|
| 3:19:37| I regret that advice was given to not speak with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11977)|
| 3:19:43| I always think that is a healthy thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11983)|
| 3:19:47| It seems to me in listening to all this, there's something that's not being said, and that bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11987)|
| 3:19:53| I think the same observation was made last time by Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11993)|
| 3:19:59| I'm not sure what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=11999)|
| 3:20:00| I've got some hunches, but obviously, or at least it appears to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12000)|
| 3:20:05| there is very little trust between the parties involved here, and that's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12005)|
| 3:20:11| I think anything that happens is going to be awkward and problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12011)|
| 3:20:16| I would like to call for the question, however, and move on with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12016)|
| 3:20:24| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12024)|
| 3:20:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12026)|
| 3:20:34| Starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12034)|
| 3:20:35| Where are we going to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12035)|
| 3:20:39| Starting first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12039)|
| 3:20:44| Commissioner McKenzie, this is on the call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12044)|
| 3:20:47| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12047)|

| 3:20:59| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12059)|
| 3:21:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12060)|
| 3:21:01| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12061)|
| 3:21:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12062)|
| 3:21:03| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12063)|

| 3:21:05| Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12065)|

| 3:21:07| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12067)|

| 3:21:09| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12069)|

| 3:21:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12073)|
| 3:21:14| Thank you, Mr. Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12074)|
| 3:21:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12075)|
| 3:21:16| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12076)|
| 3:21:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12077)|
| 3:21:18| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12078)|
| 3:21:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12079)|
| 3:21:20| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12080)|
| 3:21:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12081)|
| 3:21:22| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12082)|
| 3:21:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12083)|
| 3:21:33| Call for the question passes 16-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12093)|
| 3:21:36| Mr. Chairman, will you repeat the motion we're about to vote on, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12096)|
| 3:21:39| To deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12099)|
| 3:21:41| The request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12101)|
| 3:21:42| Which also would include the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12102)|
| 3:21:45| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12105)|
| 3:21:47| So the motion is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12107)|
| 3:21:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12109)|
| 3:21:50| To deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12110)|
| 3:21:52| Do we need a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12112)|
| 3:21:54| Let's try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12114)|
| 3:21:56| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12116)|
| 3:21:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12118)|
| 3:21:59| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12119)|
| 3:22:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12120)|
| 3:22:01| Roll call vote starting in the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12121)|
| 3:22:03| The motion is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12123)|
| 3:22:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12127)|
| 3:22:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12128)|
| 3:22:12| To deny both requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12132)|
| 3:22:14| Can I make a substitute motion on the positive so that if the negative fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12134)|
| 3:22:21| then we're still left with the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12141)|
| 3:22:24| So if we make a motion to approve and then it does not pass, then it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12144)|
| 3:22:31| But if you vote on a negative, which is to deny, and there's not 10 votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12151)|
| 3:22:37| we haven't denied it and we haven't passed it and we're sort of in a limbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12157)|
| 3:22:41| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12161)|
| 3:22:43| Substitute motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12163)|
| 3:22:47| It doesn't mean I'm going to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12167)|
| 3:22:48| I just wanted to get it to where we can do it at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12168)|
| 3:22:51| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12171)|
| 3:22:52| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12172)|
| 3:22:54| Both requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12174)|
| 3:22:56| I'm not sure everybody understands what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12176)|
| 3:22:59| The motion is to approve per NPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12179)|
| 3:23:04| This way, if it gets 10 votes, yes, then it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12184)|
| 3:23:08| But if it doesn't, then it fails and we don't have to discuss it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12188)|
| 3:23:13| But if we do it the other way, where it doesn't get 10 votes to deny it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12193)|
| 3:23:18| we still haven't approved it, so we still haven't gotten anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12198)|
| 3:23:23| You haven't approved it or denied it, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12203)|
| 3:23:27| But your motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12207)|
| 3:23:29| To approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12209)|
| 3:23:31| So if it gets 10 votes, it's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12211)|
| 3:23:33| If it doesn't, it's failed and we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12213)|
| 3:23:39| Everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12219)|

| 3:24:33| I know, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12273)|
| 3:24:34| You've got to announce the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12274)|

| 3:24:47| Recognize this gentleman here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12287)|
| 3:24:48| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12288)|
| 3:24:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12289)|
| 3:24:50| May I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12290)|
| 3:24:51| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12291)|
| 3:24:52| Carson Daly, 7508 Montgomery Farm Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12292)|
| 3:24:55| I would like to thank this commission tonight for staying here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12295)|
| 3:24:58| and seeing how important this issue is for our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12298)|
| 3:25:03| And, like, again, I say I really, really appreciate you all doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12303)|
| 3:25:08| Sometimes we get mad at you, but you do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12308)|
| 3:25:12| You really do, and I appreciate everything you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12312)|
| 3:25:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12315)|

| 3:25:35| This is a resolution to create a task force to address the overcrowding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12335)|
| 3:25:38| problems in Knox County jails and suggest improvements to, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12338)|
| 3:25:42| address those mentally ill citizens who, due to a lack of alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12342)|
| 3:25:46| placement, exacerbate jail overcrowding, two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12346)|
| 3:25:51| improve the court and criminal justice systems, and, three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12351)|
| 3:25:53| any other issues the task force deems necessary and appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12353)|
| 3:25:59| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12359)|
| 3:26:01| Finance, 8-1, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12361)|
| 3:26:04| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12364)|
| 3:26:05| Intergovernmental, 7-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12365)|
| 3:26:07| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12367)|
| 3:26:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12368)|
| 3:26:11| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12371)|
| 3:26:15| Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12375)|
| 3:26:18| Who seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12378)|
| 3:26:20| I believe it was Commissioner McKenzie who seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12380)|
| 3:26:23| Go ahead, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12383)|
| 3:26:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12385)|
| 3:26:26| I was wondering if Commissioner Hammett might consider what I believe to be a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12386)|
| 3:26:32| to relabel his point number 3-4 and add the following point 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12392)|
| 3:26:36| the status and value of recommendations made in the Institute for Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12396)|
| 3:26:42| and Policy Planning Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12402)|
| 3:26:44| The reason I would like to add that is this is not the first time we've addressed this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12404)|
| 3:26:48| Two years ago, $50,000 of taxpayer money was spent on a report on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12408)|
| 3:26:54| and I would think it would be very valuable just to instruct this group to consider the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12414)|
| 3:26:59| in that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12419)|
| 3:27:01| Certainly, I would be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12421)|
| 3:27:02| Would the seconding be acceptable with that friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12422)|
| 3:27:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12425)|
| 3:27:06| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12426)|
| 3:27:07| That's all I wanted to do to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12427)|
| 3:27:08| Mr. Chairman, if I might, Mr. Nichols appeared before us during our budget hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12428)|
| 3:27:12| and he said that he had a plan for significant savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12432)|
| 3:27:14| I visited with Mr. Nichols, and we had a very productive session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12434)|
| 3:27:18| Together, we felt that forming a task force to look at some of these specific issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12438)|
| 3:27:23| and reporting back to this body by September was a reasonable amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12443)|
| 3:27:27| I think he's got some really good ideas, but he wants to bring everybody to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12447)|
| 3:27:30| including some members of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12450)|
| 3:27:33| And he had listed people that he felt should be involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12453)|
| 3:27:37| I don't presume to tell the Chairman who to select,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12457)|
| 3:27:39| but if Commissioner Briggs were interested in serving on this task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12459)|
| 3:27:42| I think he would be an excellent addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12462)|
| 3:27:44| and I would like to recommend that he be one of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12464)|
| 3:27:47| I'm not looking for anything else to do, so please don't ask me to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12467)|
| 3:27:51| I just wanted to bring it forward so we could get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12471)|
| 3:27:53| But I think Commissioner Briggs would be an excellent addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12473)|
| 3:27:55| And anyone else that you would want to select?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12475)|
| 3:28:05| Just money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12485)|
| 3:28:07| Did you all come up with a make-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12487)|
| 3:28:10| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12490)|
| 3:28:11| It's in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12491)|
| 3:28:12| It includes the sheriff, the chief of police, members of the homeless coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12492)|
| 3:28:16| and I think Commissioner Mark Harmon's suggestion is very good that we take the study that's been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12496)|
| 3:28:20| look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12500)|
| 3:28:21| But also there have been some changes in state law and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12501)|
| 3:28:23| and I believe that Mr. Nichols is ready to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12503)|
| 3:28:26| But more importantly, he feels like at our September commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12506)|
| 3:28:29| that we can come with specific recommendations on some specific savings and a plan of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12509)|
| 3:28:34| And so I believe that that would be helpful for us to look at in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12514)|
| 3:28:37| Have they all agreed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12517)|
| 3:28:38| Yes, they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12518)|
| 3:28:40| The only thing that we need are, I believe, two, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12520)|
| 3:28:44| And I've got an idea for the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12524)|
| 3:28:48| I think that Mr. Brad Anders would do a great job at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12528)|
| 3:28:51| I think that his experience in law enforcement would make him very well-suited for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12531)|
| 3:28:58| if he's willing to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12538)|
| 3:29:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12541)|
| 3:29:02| So everyone okay with Dr. Briggs, Commissioner Briggs, and Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12542)|
| 3:29:07| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12547)|
| 3:29:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12548)|
| 3:29:09| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12549)|
| 3:29:10| I was going to nominate Amy Brawls, just in case somebody doesn't want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12550)|
| 3:29:14| She's expressed an interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12554)|
| 3:29:17| Well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12557)|
| 3:29:19| Do you have something, Commissioner Ivan Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12559)|
| 3:29:21| I just want to make sure we're not going to spend a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12561)|
| 3:29:23| And I think what Commissioner Harmon suggested was to use the reports that we've had previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12563)|
| 3:29:28| Is that right, Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12568)|
| 3:29:29| Certainly reference them and use that as a starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12569)|
| 3:29:32| Don't use a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12572)|
| 3:29:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12573)|
| 3:29:34| Yeah, there will not be any cost to this because all the people will be donating their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12574)|
| 3:29:37| And they will bring all recommendations to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12577)|
| 3:29:39| That's the idea is to be specific as far as cost savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12579)|
| 3:29:43| and some ways to implement some of the things they have out at the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12583)|
| 3:29:47| One thing, for example, there's been a clarification of the law with regards to people using video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12587)|
| 3:29:52| instead of coming all the way here to appear before a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12592)|
| 3:29:54| That's one of the things to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12594)|
| 3:29:55| That could be significant savings instead of bringing them all here on buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12595)|
| 3:30:00| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12600)|
| 3:30:02| Well, having a husband and a daughter in the medical field, also, there's a huge need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12602)|
| 3:30:08| This is basically physicians' hands and hospitals are tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12608)|
| 3:30:13| There's not much they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12613)|
| 3:30:15| I mean, we all know since Lakeshore disbanded, and I doubt that will ever come back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12615)|
| 3:30:22| But this is a very sad issue that we deal with as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12622)|
| 3:30:28| And I think our state, we may need to go all the way to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12628)|
| 3:30:33| with some different legislative as to what can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12633)|
| 3:30:37| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12637)|
| 3:30:39| I mean, I think Mr. Anders and Dr. Briggs would be great at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12639)|
| 3:30:46| I mean, I understand the real need for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12646)|
| 3:30:50| because I hear it every day about there's not much they can do with this really sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12650)|
| 3:30:58| And I would even be glad to serve on it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12658)|
| 3:31:00| So whatever the commission decides to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12660)|
| 3:31:04| I mean, it is a need, and I'm glad you brought this forward, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12664)|
| 3:31:11| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12671)|
| 3:31:12| Here's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12672)|
| 3:31:14| When I look down this list, I see a lot of people who are in law enforcement, in the courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12674)|
| 3:31:19| and I only see one, potentially one person, maybe two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12679)|
| 3:31:24| but most likely just one person who's from the social services industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12684)|
| 3:31:28| We're talking about mentally ill people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12688)|
| 3:31:31| We need to have social services more strongly represented on this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12691)|
| 3:31:37| And it doesn't have to be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12697)|
| 3:31:38| It can be someone from, you know, well, there's one from Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12698)|
| 3:31:46| I don't think one is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12706)|
| 3:31:48| I think we need more people from social services represented on this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12708)|
| 3:31:56| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12716)|
| 3:31:59| I tend to agree with Commissioner Burroughs in that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12719)|
| 3:32:04| I think task force like this really need a diverse and varied opinions as it relates to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12724)|
| 3:32:15| So I guess I'm asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12735)|
| 3:32:18| I don't know if Commissioner Norman actually entered Commissioner Burroughs' name into the mix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12738)|
| 3:32:24| or maybe we can vote on two of the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12744)|
| 3:32:30| It's up to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12750)|
| 3:32:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12751)|
| 3:32:32| I'm going to put her name out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12752)|
| 3:32:42| Can we amend the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12762)|
| 3:32:44| If we've got three people that want to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12764)|
| 3:32:46| If we have three, let's don't choose because they all want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12766)|
| 3:32:49| So, I mean, I don't have a problem saying three if Commissioner Burroughs wants to be on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12769)|
| 3:32:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12773)|
| 3:32:54| And could you add another slot for another social services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12774)|
| 3:32:57| I was about to make that same suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12777)|
| 3:32:59| Let's add another slot for someone and just put someone within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12779)|
| 3:33:04| How about someone from like volunteer ministries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12784)|
| 3:33:07| Well, we have somebody from the 10-year homeless plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12787)|
| 3:33:11| How about Red Cross or some other organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12791)|
| 3:33:18| Health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12798)|
| 3:33:20| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12800)|
| 3:33:21| We can do some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12801)|
| 3:33:22| Well, I'm trying to get away from someone who's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12802)|
| 3:33:25| How about Cherokee Health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12805)|
| 3:33:27| Cherokee Health would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12807)|
| 3:33:29| Cherokee Health would be excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12809)|
| 3:33:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12810)|
| 3:33:31| Let's say representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12811)|
| 3:33:32| If we start getting too many people, we're not going to make our set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12812)|
| 3:33:34| I mean, the whole idea is to try to come in with a plan for next budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12814)|
| 3:33:38| So, I will agree to another commissioner and somebody from Cherokee Health, and I think that's plenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12818)|
| 3:33:42| How about somebody say UT football?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12822)|
| 3:33:49| They got a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12829)|
| 3:33:51| It's been a long day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12831)|
| 3:33:53| That was seat B, district A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12833)|
| 3:33:55| I'm a district 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12835)|
| 3:34:00| You're moving to the 8th, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12840)|
| 3:34:04| I don't know if it's not supposed to select the three, so I'll select those three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12844)|
| 3:34:08| Find out tomorrow night, Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12848)|
| 3:34:09| Commissioner Brawls, Commissioner Anderson, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12849)|
| 3:34:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12855)|
| 3:34:16| And be the representative from the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12856)|
| 3:34:19| And Cherokee Health will be adding a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12859)|
| 3:34:24| This is a motion on the floor, so all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12864)|
| 3:34:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12867)|
| 3:34:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12868)|
| 3:34:29| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12869)|
| 3:34:30| Of course, that was as amended, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12870)|
| 3:34:31| As amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12871)|
| 3:34:39| Resolution 917 is the resolution to reschedule a week earlier in July 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12879)|
| 3:34:44| the Knox County Commission's Finance Committee meeting, Intergovernmental Committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12884)|
| 3:34:48| Regular Commission meeting, Beer Matters and Appeals meeting, and Zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12888)|
| 3:34:54| Finance, 9-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12894)|
| 3:34:57| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12897)|
| 3:34:58| 7-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12898)|
| 3:35:01| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12901)|
| 3:35:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12903)|
| 3:35:05| Commissioner Brawls, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12905)|
| 3:35:08| I think we talked about this at Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12908)|
| 3:35:12| I think we may have talked about it at Finance too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12912)|
| 3:35:15| Just that the NACO conference, our regular commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12915)|
| 3:35:20| is in the middle of the NACO conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12920)|
| 3:35:22| According to our commission rules, the chair or his or her designee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12922)|
| 3:35:27| and one other commission member are required to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12927)|
| 3:35:34| The conference this year is in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12934)|
| 3:35:37| It's close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12937)|
| 3:35:39| I hope that many of us will attend, but at the very least, two of us have to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12939)|
| 3:35:46| So I would ask that the meetings be moved up a week so that two of us won't have to miss our commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12946)|
| 3:35:55| or so that we don't have to drive back from Nashville for one day and then drive back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12955)|
| 3:36:01| Every time somebody takes a vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12961)|
| 3:36:04| Well, there's been a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12964)|
| 3:36:07| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12967)|
| 3:36:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12969)|
| 3:36:11| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12971)|
| 3:36:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12972)|
| 3:36:15| One abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12975)|
| 3:36:16| Who would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12976)|
| 3:36:17| You all sound so tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12977)|
| 3:36:18| I just said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12978)|
| 3:36:19| Really, I mean, it affects my vacation time and my babysitter that I've already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12979)|
| 3:36:23| I mean, we plan out three months ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12983)|
| 3:36:25| And I just, I mean, I think it, for two people, I think it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12985)|
| 3:36:28| Who are the yeses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12988)|
| 3:36:33| Yeses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12993)|
| 3:36:35| Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12995)|
| 3:36:38| My family also has vacation that they've set in time for that week, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12998)|
| 3:36:42| So that's why I'm opposing it because we set our schedule around that week also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13002)|
| 3:36:51| Motion fails six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13011)|
| 3:36:56| Fourteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13016)|
| 3:36:59| Fourteen no's, four yeses, and one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13019)|
| 3:37:03| I may go just to miss the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13023)|
| 3:37:12| 118.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13032)|
| 3:37:18| 118 is on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13038)|
| 3:37:23| 918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13043)|
| 3:37:25| He's getting tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13045)|
| 3:37:31| We must be getting near the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13051)|
| 3:37:35| 920 is the sheet that was passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13055)|
| 3:37:39| This is a resolution approving a letter from commission to be hand-delivered to William Lockett, Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13059)|
| 3:37:44| Knox County Law Director, requesting he provide the Knox County Commission with a letter that serves to identify any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13064)|
| 3:37:50| and all persons to whom William S. Lockett, Jr. is monetarily indebted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13070)|
| 3:37:55| and who is employed and or does business with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13075)|
| 3:37:59| and appears or may appear before the Knox County Commission and or its appointed committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13079)|
| 3:38:05| Commissioner Burroughs, you want to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13085)|
| 3:38:08| Yes, this is just to further insulate and protect Knox County taxpayers from any potential conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13088)|
| 3:38:17| If we know up front who he is indebted to, we will know if there is a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13097)|
| 3:38:25| or if there has been a problem since he's taken office in terms of conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13105)|
| 3:38:32| This is 920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13112)|
| 3:38:36| 920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13116)|
| 3:38:39| Do we have a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13119)|
| 3:38:41| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13121)|
| 3:38:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13123)|
| 3:38:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13124)|
| 3:38:45| Mr. Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13125)|
| 3:38:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13126)|
| 3:38:48| I think it's a good idea, but I'm curious as to, you know, every year we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13128)|
| 3:38:53| and I believe all public officials, have to fill out their disclosure form for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13133)|
| 3:38:58| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13138)|
| 3:38:59| Is that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13139)|
| 3:39:00| I mean, that information should be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13140)|
| 3:39:03| It should be, but he wrote none on his disclosure when he had already, the month before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13143)|
| 3:39:08| taken a $10,000 loan from Tim Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13148)|
| 3:39:16| Well, now, I believe that state disclosure is as it relates to your campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13156)|
| 3:39:20| because I have never looked at anybody's disclosure in some mortgage or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13160)|
| 3:39:26| I believe it's your campaign account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13166)|
| 3:39:28| It doesn't include mortgages, but it does include personal loans that are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13168)|
| 3:39:33| Any loan that you've taken out over the last 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13173)|
| 3:39:37| That's not publicly already within public purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13177)|
| 3:39:44| That $10,000 should have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13184)|
| 3:39:48| Will you finish, Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13188)|
| 3:39:50| Well, you know, originally I was going to oppose this on the grounds of right to privacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13190)|
| 3:39:57| but went back and reread the Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13197)|
| 3:40:00| and there's not a guaranteed right to privacy anywhere within the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13200)|
| 3:40:07| I do believe that the public has a legitimate concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13207)|
| 3:40:11| I don't believe that we need to make this, we need to single out Mr. Lockett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13211)|
| 3:40:16| and make this personal toward him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13216)|
| 3:40:18| What I think that we need to do is that all elected officials in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13218)|
| 3:40:23| should submit some sort of a financial disclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13223)|
| 3:40:27| basically saying where they get their money from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13227)|
| 3:40:29| Mr. Lambert, everyone else has already submitted this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13229)|
| 3:40:33| We all were required to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13233)|
| 3:40:35| Mr. Lockett is the only one who has admitted that he took money and did not disclose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13235)|
| 3:40:41| The way I read that state disclosure, if I understood it correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13241)|
| 3:40:47| and I may have filled mine out wrong, not that I owe very much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13247)|
| 3:40:51| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13251)|
| 3:40:52| I didn't put anything on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13252)|
| 3:40:55| And, of course, I owe very little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13255)|
| 3:40:57| I think maybe at the time I filled that out I might have had 50 bucks on my credit card statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13257)|
| 3:41:02| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13262)|
| 3:41:04| But I think that if we're going to ask Mr. Lockett for this, we need to ask everyone for this, including ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13264)|
| 3:41:11| We need to fill this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13271)|
| 3:41:12| We already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13272)|
| 3:41:14| We already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13274)|
| 3:41:15| Every one of us was required to fill one of these out and submit it, and we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13275)|
| 3:41:20| And Mr. Lockett filled one out and submitted it as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13280)|
| 3:41:23| but he has since admitted that he took a $10,000 loan from Tim Graham and did not disclose it on this form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13283)|
| 3:41:31| But you're saying you're not willing to disclose something locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13291)|
| 3:41:35| I have disclosed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13295)|
| 3:41:36| I've disclosed everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13296)|
| 3:41:38| We all should have done this by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13298)|
| 3:41:40| Then why not just agree with me and say let's all do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13300)|
| 3:41:43| Because we've already done it, Lumpy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13303)|
| 3:41:47| We haven't done it on the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13307)|
| 3:41:49| We filled out our state forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13309)|
| 3:41:51| Mr. Jarrett, could you please give an opinion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13311)|
| 3:41:54| Hold on, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13314)|
| 3:41:58| I'm just saying what's good for the goose is good for the gander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13318)|
| 3:42:01| If we're going to ask Mr. Lockett for this kind of information, and I think it's absolutely appropriate to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13321)|
| 3:42:07| I think that we should be willing to step forward with that information ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13327)|
| 3:42:11| and we should ask every elected official in Knox County to do exactly the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13331)|
| 3:42:16| Let's not make this personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13336)|
| 3:42:18| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13338)|
| 3:42:19| Lumpy, we've already done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13339)|
| 3:42:21| Everybody has already done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13341)|
| 3:42:22| It's one of the steps that we have to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13342)|
| 3:42:24| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13344)|
| 3:42:26| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13346)|
| 3:42:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13347)|
| 3:42:31| The only thing that I have heartburn with this about is, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13351)|
| 3:42:37| we've got to remember we're in the middle of an investigation with Mr. Lockett and requesting, subpoenaing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13357)|
| 3:42:43| resoluting, this is all, all of this is discovery, and we need to be careful as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13363)|
| 3:42:50| This is a state ethics commission issue, and the TBI can look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13370)|
| 3:42:56| and the TBI and the Attorney General needs to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13376)|
| 3:42:59| We don't need to be requesting anything that may become evidence later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13379)|
| 3:43:05| And we've got to be careful that we don't overstep our jurisdictional boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13385)|
| 3:43:11| Now, let all the alphabets do their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13391)|
| 3:43:16| and then because you're opening up a can of worms here where we're violating, we're possibly violating evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13396)|
| 3:43:22| And I don't want to be a stumbling block to this investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13402)|
| 3:43:26| And I think that we need to be very careful that we do not ask for evidence that could be used in a criminal or civil action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13406)|
| 3:43:36| I'm going to have to write another letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13416)|
| 3:43:39| I have to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13419)|
| 3:43:41| Commissioner Wright, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13421)|
| 3:43:45| Well, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13425)|
| 3:43:46| I don't know if I had to or not, but if anyone wants to know who does my investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13426)|
| 3:43:49| if anyone wants to know what money I owe, just look at the state ethics commission form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13429)|
| 3:43:55| It's on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13435)|
| 3:43:56| There's nothing more to disclose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13436)|
| 3:43:58| If we need to disclose something locally, just copy it and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13438)|
| 3:44:03| It's there, including a loan that I have on a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13443)|
| 3:44:09| As far as this, I would like to make a friendly amendment to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13449)|
| 3:44:12| We may vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13452)|
| 3:44:13| Is it not only for people that have loaned him money, but also businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13453)|
| 3:44:17| or organizations because some of this money may have been loaned to him, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13457)|
| 3:44:22| by a development LLC or something along that line where there could be a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13462)|
| 3:44:28| So I would ask to add that as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13468)|
| 3:44:30| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13470)|
| 3:44:33| I would accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13473)|
| 3:44:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13474)|
| 3:44:35| Would you second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13475)|
| 3:44:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13476)|
| 3:44:37| Mr. Pink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13477)|
| 3:44:38| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13478)|
| 3:44:39| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13479)|
| 3:44:40| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13480)|
| 3:44:41| I'm in agreement with Mr. Anders there on this, but here's the thing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13481)|
| 3:44:46| Commissioner Briggs said I could look at his form that he filled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13486)|
| 3:44:50| I don't know if anybody in here has borrowed any money since we filled those forms out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13490)|
| 3:44:54| Everybody here could owe $10,000 to $20,000 to someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13494)|
| 3:44:58| There's no way that we can control this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13498)|
| 3:45:01| People come up here in front of us all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13501)|
| 3:45:03| I'm like lumpy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13503)|
| 3:45:04| What we should do then is make it to every elected official, and every time they borrow any money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13504)|
| 3:45:09| they need to file a disclosure on it because what we filled out at election time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13509)|
| 3:45:14| or you filled out at election time may not be any good now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13514)|
| 3:45:18| I don't know whether Mr. Briggs said I could look at his,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13518)|
| 3:45:20| but I don't know whether he's borrowed any money that wouldn't be on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13520)|
| 3:45:24| Now, I'm not picking on you, Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13524)|
| 3:45:25| What I'm saying is we just don't know what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13525)|
| 3:45:28| Everybody here could owe money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13528)|
| 3:45:31| They could have borrowed it last week, last month or month before last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13531)|
| 3:45:36| So I'm going to be against this because I really feel like we're opening up in a can of worms here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13536)|
| 3:45:41| and we could be hurting evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13541)|
| 3:45:43| I'm going along with Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13543)|
| 3:45:45| He's a policeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13545)|
| 3:45:46| He's not a lawyer, but I think he knows what evidence is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13546)|
| 3:45:50| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13550)|
| 3:45:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13552)|
| 3:45:55| I struggle with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13555)|
| 3:46:00| We've done a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13560)|
| 3:46:02| We have done a whole heck of a lot as it relates to William Soper Lockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13562)|
| 3:46:10| We have passed a bunch of really strongly worded resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13570)|
| 3:46:17| We've asked for resignations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13577)|
| 3:46:20| We've given ultimatums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13580)|
| 3:46:23| We've done a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13583)|
| 3:46:25| We have, in my humble opinion, left no doubt in our constituents' mind how we feel about the acts of our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13585)|
| 3:46:39| hope to be soon, former law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13599)|
| 3:46:45| This could potentially, you know, law enforcement people are pretty crafty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13605)|
| 3:46:52| Maybe they already have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13612)|
| 3:46:56| Maybe that's already in, if he made some erroneous statements in this disclosure, maybe they're working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13616)|
| 3:47:06| And maybe what we're doing, as Commissioner Anders said, is jeopardizing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13626)|
| 3:47:11| But then the converse of that, you know, okay, say we get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13631)|
| 3:47:17| We got it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13637)|
| 3:47:19| And we're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13639)|
| 3:47:21| We can't do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13641)|
| 3:47:23| Can't do a thing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13643)|
| 3:47:25| So, you know, we've done a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13645)|
| 3:47:28| Let's try to, we're not going to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13648)|
| 3:47:33| So I'm not saying move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13653)|
| 3:47:34| Believe me, I'm not saying move on because that ain't going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13654)|
| 3:47:37| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13657)|
| 3:47:39| But in terms of resolution after resolution after resolution, I think the one that I signed on today was strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13659)|
| 3:47:48| It was extremely well put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13668)|
| 3:47:51| I think we made some quality amendments to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13671)|
| 3:47:54| We've asked for all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13674)|
| 3:47:56| So let's try not to pass any more of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13676)|
| 3:48:00| I think we made our statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13680)|
| 3:48:02| We had a special call meeting, put the cobbler together three, censured them, we did all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13682)|
| 3:48:08| So let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13688)|
| 3:48:10| That's why I'm not going to be in favor of this one or any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13690)|
| 3:48:15| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13695)|
| 3:48:17| I just want to say that as far as hampering a criminal investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13697)|
| 3:48:24| that didn't seem to be a huge concern when we were talking about filing an ouster suit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13704)|
| 3:48:28| which might also hamper a criminal investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13708)|
| 3:48:33| As to the time frame, we could amend this to say anything that should have been disclosed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13713)|
| 3:48:39| on the State Ethics Committee Disclosure Report and was not needs to be disclosed at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13719)|
| 3:48:47| That does away with Commissioner Pinkston's concern that any of us could have done anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13727)|
| 3:48:54| between the time we filed that form and now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13734)|
| 3:49:01| In my opinion, this just serves to insulate and protect Knox County taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13741)|
| 3:49:07| from any potential fallout from this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13747)|
| 3:49:11| If you all choose not to vote for it, that's certainly up to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13751)|
| 3:49:18| But I'm glad that I've gone on the record of saying that that's my primary concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13758)|
| 3:49:27| are the voters of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13767)|
| 3:49:32| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13772)|
| 3:49:34| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13774)|
| 3:49:35| Amy, my concern is with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13775)|
| 3:49:37| I understand where you're coming from and I understand what Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13777)|
| 3:49:40| I tend to agree with Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13780)|
| 3:49:41| What concerns me is, I mean, everything we've asked him to do, he's not done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13781)|
| 3:49:45| He's not going to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13785)|
| 3:49:46| These audits, they're going to give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13786)|
| 3:49:48| We will find this information out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13788)|
| 3:49:51| It's like, oh, we keep beating him and beating him and beating him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13791)|
| 3:49:54| I'm ready to sort of move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13794)|
| 3:49:55| I understand that he's probably not going to give it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13795)|
| 3:49:58| That's not exactly the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13798)|
| 3:50:00| The point is that we've asked for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13800)|
| 3:50:02| So we've done our due diligence as far as the taxpayers of Knox County go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13802)|
| 3:50:07| I think, you know, we're going to find that information out in the coming months with TBI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13807)|
| 3:50:13| all these people doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13813)|
| 3:50:18| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13818)|
| 3:50:21| It's supper time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13821)|
| 3:50:22| I call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13822)|
| 3:50:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13827)|
| 3:50:28| There are no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13828)|
| 3:50:29| We can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13829)|
| 3:50:30| We have one light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13830)|
| 3:50:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13831)|
| 3:50:32| I'll pull it a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13832)|
| 3:50:36| Let's just vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13836)|
| 3:50:44| The motion on the floor is to approve as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13844)|
| 3:50:47| And the amendment was what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13847)|

| 3:52:19| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13939)|
| 3:52:20| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13940)|

| 3:52:26| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13946)|

| 3:52:28| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13948)|
| 3:52:29| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13949)|
| 3:52:30| And if that the passers wish to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13950)|
| 3:52:32| Yes, I'm going to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13952)|
| 3:52:37| So the yes is a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13957)|
| 3:52:40| Six nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13960)|
| 3:52:42| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13962)|
| 3:52:43| Six yes, 13 no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13963)|
| 3:52:47| that it. We have nine twenty one we have three more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13967)|
| 3:52:51| plus we got. Resolution nine twenty one is approving a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13971)|
| 3:52:58| from someone with a happy hour. Are you. Approving a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13978)|
| 3:53:06| letter from commission to be hand delivered to. William Lockett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13986)|
| 3:53:10| junior not county law director requesting he henceforth cease and desist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13990)|
| 3:53:14| from representing the not county commission and all of its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13994)|
| 3:53:17| appointed boards and committees. In any and all litigation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=13997)|
| 3:53:21| trend transactional matters one of order so I believe it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14001)|
| 3:53:24| already been done actually and that's that's why I put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14004)|
| 3:53:28| this resolution out there and I double check this with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14008)|
| 3:53:30| Mr. Jarrett before I did so what we did was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14010)|
| 3:53:32| ask him not to appear. At meetings we didn't ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14012)|
| 3:53:37| him not to represent us in and I thought I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14017)|
| 3:53:40| was the maker of that motion and I thought that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14020)|
| 3:53:42| was what my motion was is that he no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14022)|
| 3:53:44| represents the commission which would include. Any business the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14024)|
| 3:53:49| commission is doing and I believe Mr. Armstrong that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14029)|
| 3:53:53| what I was taking. Out of your resolution was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14033)|
| 3:53:58| that he no longer represents commission and to me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14038)|
| 3:54:01| would mean any boards or committees or task for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14041)|
| 3:54:04| all that anything else that the commission would be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14044)|
| 3:54:10| And if that's not correct within the minutes than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14050)|
| 3:54:12| clerk needs to correct that within the minutes. If that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14052)|
| 3:54:19| what took place and that that was as as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14059)|
| 3:54:23| the maker of that motion that's what I'm I'm in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14063)|
| 3:54:26| and it and OK then I'm happy to withdraw this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14066)|
| 3:54:29| if that's already been taken care of it back I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14069)|
| 3:54:31| mean as long as the law director. Understand that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14071)|
| 3:54:35| the least this isn't law director understands that was what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14075)|
| 3:54:38| it was meant to be. That was the way I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14078)|
| 3:54:41| understood the amendment and that's the way you understood the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14081)|
| 3:54:44| amendment. I did also. But I also want to point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14084)|
| 3:54:51| out. I'll tell them shut up again. I mean but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14091)|
| 3:54:56| if we need to clarify it by voting this through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14096)|
| 3:55:00| I don't mind doing that but I just thought that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14100)|
| 3:55:02| what we had already done. I was just moved to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14102)|
| 3:55:04| correct the minutes to stress this point. But I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14104)|
| 3:55:08| that we know minutes have not been published we've not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14108)|
| 3:55:11| had a chance to approve or diminish if they've not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14111)|
| 3:55:14| come before us to approve or not. Mr. Chairman if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14114)|
| 3:55:18| I might point out. Even though he is not physically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14118)|
| 3:55:22| at those meetings. He is still legally responsible for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14122)|
| 3:55:26| legal affairs of Knox County. So even though we're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14126)|
| 3:55:30| you can't come to your boards we cannot restrict him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14130)|
| 3:55:32| and say you can't be involved in the legal affairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14132)|
| 3:55:35| because if indeed he decides to do that then he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14135)|
| 3:55:37| is subject to ouster. And so he is still going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14137)|
| 3:55:40| to be involved. Am I correct Mr. Jarrett I mean he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14140)|
| 3:55:42| not going to just come in and just do nothing if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14142)|
| 3:55:44| he does then we can oust him. I think he's still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14144)|
| 3:55:46| going to be involved with the legal affairs of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14146)|
| 3:55:49| County. I guess we've only said commission. I mean if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14149)|
| 3:55:52| he shows up at say the school board or somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14152)|
| 3:55:55| I guess he's. But I mean even though he's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14155)|
| 3:55:57| physically there he's still in the office and he is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14157)|
| 3:55:59| still basically calling the shots. Well he can still run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14159)|
| 3:56:02| the office. We've not told him he can't run the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14162)|
| 3:56:04| office. We've only said you can't represent. We fired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14164)|
| 3:56:07| him as our attorney. I don't think we can fire him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14167)|
| 3:56:10| as our attorney. Well I can't. I think by resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14170)|
| 3:56:13| that's what that's what our resolution that we passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14173)|
| 3:56:15| that a special meeting was is that we basically were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14175)|
| 3:56:18| firing him as the commission's. Attorney. I wish I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14178)|
| 3:56:23| the letter that he sent me back. I'm not mistaken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14183)|
| 3:56:28| basically. That's what the court does. I believe I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14188)|
| 3:56:33| though that by the charter if you read that second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14193)|
| 3:56:35| sentence in paragraph D. It says that by resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14195)|
| 3:56:38| the county commission is empowered and authorized to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14198)|
| 3:56:42| another attorney. Exactly. And at this point we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14202)|
| 3:56:46| a couple of years and you said it was a legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14206)|
| 3:56:49| opinion. Would you send us a copy of the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14209)|
| 3:56:51| he sent you. OK. Thank you. Mr. Chairman are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14211)|
| 3:56:55| comfortable that he's not representing us currently as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14215)|
| 3:56:58| Comfortable with it. Thank you. I have all my dealings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14218)|
| 3:57:01| with attorney Jarrett. Period. So you withdrew it. You withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14221)|
| 3:57:11| Yes. If this has been taken care of in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14231)|
| 3:57:14| previous resolution then I'm happy to withdraw it. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14234)|
| 3:57:18| no need to beat a dead horse. I am. Too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14238)|
| 3:57:23| Bad choice of words. I apologize. Too late. Again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14243)|

| 3:57:40| we're going to go to twenty three twenty three. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14260)|
| 3:57:43| Nine twenty three. Resolution nine twenty three is requesting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14263)|
| 3:57:49| the law firm of Kennerly Montgomery and family appear before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14269)|
| 3:57:52| the not county commission to advise the commission as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14272)|
| 3:57:55| why there does not exist a conflict of interest relative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14275)|
| 3:57:59| to the firm's continued legal representation of the not county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14279)|

| 3:58:06| don't have that out. I mean come on. Actually no it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14286)|
| 3:58:10| was a different or a different aspect of it. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14290)|
| 3:58:14| Exactly. My darling man. You wish to withdraw that. Now I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14294)|
| 3:58:18| don't. You really want to fight about it tonight. I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14298)|
| 3:58:23| like I'm getting phone calls and emails from constituents who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14303)|
| 3:58:28| have questions about what the law firm knew and when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14308)|
| 3:58:33| knew it. And this is an opportunity for that to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14313)|
| 3:58:36| matter of public record. That's all I'm saying. I mean you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14316)|
| 3:58:38| want to vote it down then by all means do so. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14318)|
| 3:58:41| I've done my due diligence when it comes to my constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14321)|
| 3:58:45| and the voters of Knox County. I don't believe they'll come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14325)|
| 3:58:48| down here because they're involved in this lawsuit and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14328)|
| 3:58:50| don't believe they'll come down. They may not. But I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14330)|
| 3:58:54| think they can. I think they'd be jeopardizing their case. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14334)|
| 3:58:58| may be wrong. Maybe not. Like I said I've done my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14338)|
| 3:59:01| due diligence. We have a call in a second. There's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14341)|
| 3:59:08| motion on the floor. I'd like one quick question Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14348)|
| 3:59:11| Chairman before. Yeah I would too. The same question I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14351)|
| 3:59:17| asked three or four hours ago. Pension board members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14357)|
| 3:59:21| pension board are right to vote on this issue. Well the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14361)|
| 3:59:25| charter reads that the pension board is empowered to hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14365)|
| 3:59:28| their attorney and that's the attorneys for the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14368)|
| 3:59:31| You can request the council to come before this board in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14371)|
| 3:59:36| the event there are unanswered questions relative to any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14376)|
| 3:59:39| potential conflict of interest. They can certainly be before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14379)|
| 3:59:41| this board and answer questions as long as they don't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14381)|
| 3:59:44| into the realm of attorney client privilege or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14384)|
| 3:59:46| confidentiality. But I believe and I'm if I'm mistaken I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14386)|
| 3:59:50| certainly correct myself but I thought when Mr. Beal was here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14390)|
| 3:59:53| he intimated that they'd have no objection basically assuaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14393)|
| 3:59:58| the board's fears in that regard. That was my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14398)|
| 4:00:00| recollection. So you don't see any conflict as we as existed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14400)|
| 4:00:05| in the earlier vote. No sir. I mean in terms of we start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14405)|
| 4:00:10| asking the questions about some of the investments are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14410)|
| 4:00:13| make that may be confidential until they're exposed. But in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14413)|
| 4:00:16| terms of them assuaging any concerns of the board that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14416)|
| 4:00:19| there's a potential conflict of interest it wouldn't take much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14419)|
| 4:00:23| of them to clear that up. Thank you. But we would be asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14423)|
| 4:00:28| them to tell us that they don't have a conflict of interest for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14428)|
| 4:00:31| another entity which is what the pension board is. Yes and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14431)|
| 4:00:37| Like I said I'm getting lots of phone calls from constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14437)|
| 4:00:41| who have questions about who at the law firm knew what and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14441)|
| 4:00:46| when they knew it. That's all. I'm just trying to get answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14446)|
| 4:00:50| to those questions and I want them to be a matter of public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14450)|
| 4:00:53| record. This protects the law firm as well as protecting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14453)|
| 4:00:58| taxpayers of Knox County and getting the answers that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14458)|
| 4:01:03| are asking for. Mr. Jarrett. I believe that's right that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14463)|
| 4:01:08| Beeler said he didn't feel like Kennerly, Montgomery and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14468)|
| 4:01:11| Finley would have a problem coming down and answering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14471)|
| 4:01:13| questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=14473)|
