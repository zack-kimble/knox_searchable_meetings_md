| 0:00:30| Hello. Welcome to the September Agenda Review Meeting. I'm Scott Smith filling in for Commissioner Phillips, who's out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=30)|
| 0:00:39| Let's start off the meeting with Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=39)|
| 0:00:44| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=44)|
| 0:00:47| Good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=47)|
| 0:00:49| I have just a few announcements for you. This seems really loud. I'm going to push it a little bit further away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=49)|
| 0:00:56| I'll give you some updates on what staff has been up to and a couple things that are coming up soon here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=56)|
| 0:01:03| So redistricting committees, you all might have heard that since the new census numbers have come out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=63)|
| 0:01:10| both City Council and County Commission will be addressing redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=70)|
| 0:01:15| State law requires that all county and city legislative bodies to evaluate their districts at least once every 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=75)|
| 0:01:21| This ensures that districts have approximately equal populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=81)|
| 0:01:26| The first meeting of the Knox County Redistricting Committee meeting was held last Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=86)|
| 0:01:31| and planning staff have been asked to develop a website for this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=91)|
| 0:01:35| It's KnoxCountyDistricts.org. I will send you all an email as well with this information later today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=95)|
| 0:01:42| We've also been asked to provide demographic trends, measure the need for redistribution of district population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=102)|
| 0:01:48| to ensure the principle of one person, one vote, and provide and possibly build and operate a computer mapping model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=108)|
| 0:01:56| to identify alternatives for this committee to consider over the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=116)|
| 0:02:01| City Council will also begin a similar process on September 16th, and staff have been asked to support that effort as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=121)|
| 0:02:09| If you are interested, please take a look at this website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| and as the process progresses, staff will be posting some additional information on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=132)|
| 0:02:19| The annual Knox County Schools Enrollment Update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| Our GIS staff, as well as Terry Gajula, our Information Services Manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| have begun their annual update of Knox County Schools Enrollment Projections Model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| We've been assisting the school district with this effort for about 15 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=153)|
| 0:02:41| We prepare school-by-school, grade-by-grade, seven-year enrollment projections for the entire public school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=161)|
| 0:02:48| Our model requires inputs such as student addresses, inventory of buildable residential lots, student yield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| movement of students, and birth projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| At some point this winter, I will have Dr. Gajula share with you more information about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=176)|
| 0:03:03| As a reminder, we'll soon be taking applications for the November Planning Commission Meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| which will be held on Wednesday, November 10th, and not Thursday, November 11th, which is Veterans Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=188)|
| 0:03:14| and our offices will be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| Additionally, the agenda review meeting for that week will move from Tuesday to Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=196)|
| 0:03:24| We'll send you all out reminders, but I just want to make sure that your calendars reflect that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| Staff will host a community meeting on Thursday, September 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| at Sevier Heights Baptist Church on Alcoa Highway, the north campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| This is for the Alcoa Highway work that we'll be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| Staff plans on sharing existing conditions, land available for redevelopment, and constraints of the study area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| They will also be sharing and reaffirming the goals determined during the 2019 Community Design Charette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=227)|
| 0:03:54| In 2020, the City of Knoxville and Knox County each approved resolutions for planning staff to undertake a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=234)|
| 0:04:01| to develop an approach, as well as policies for envisioning and managing development along Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=241)|
| 0:04:08| If you've traveled that highway recently, you'll notice some big changes that have been occurring over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| Previous planning work has been done for the corridor through, of course, our sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| and most recently the design charette hosted by East Tennessee Community Design Center in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| There is limited area for development or redevelopment in the area due to a number of constraints, including topographical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| And because of this, our staff is working to reaffirm goals determined during the design charette from 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| and focus on redevelopment opportunities in vacant and underutilized properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| We will send the commissioners details once they are confirmed with the church on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| and then they plan to have another meeting later in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| So we'll keep you all updated on that, the progress of that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| I also want to take a moment to remind you that when making a recommendation to approve a rezoning or plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=293)|
| 0:05:01| that recommendation must be accompanied by a rationale for the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| As you know, our staff does that in our staff reports, but oftentimes you all might take a different direction than what is recommended to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=305)|
| 0:05:12| So I just want to make sure that it's really important for us to capture for the record those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=312)|
| 0:05:19| And I will send the criteria for both rezoning and plan amendments to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| So you'll have it via email. I'll do that later today or first thing tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| And we'll also do a better job of staff of making sure that we ask you during the meetings for that rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| Sometimes we just need that additional clarification for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| And finally, I would like to share with you that the annual Labor Day Sunflower Project was constructed yesterday at the Botanical Garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=339)|
| 0:05:46| Some of you might have been aware of that or participated in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| And it will be on display for the next couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| I wanted to point it out to this body because the organizers have dedicated it this year to Matt Goodwin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| your former colleague here on Planning Commission and one of the original organizers of the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| So I encourage you all to check that out. It's a really beautiful display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| Does anybody have any comments or questions to share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=366)|
| 0:06:14| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| With that, we'll get into our agenda for our review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| The first item is number 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| Michelle will lead that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| And it is going to be about the plan development process, a project that's going to be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| And as I understand, we are, for the purposes of today's discussion, to discuss the plan development process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| what we're supposed to consider in one of these reviews and not get into the specifics of this particular property and this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=395)|
| 0:06:43| but just an overall look at the process, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| And I think I'll say just a couple words before I turn it over to Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| So since we have reviewed so few plan developments and because we have a few new planning commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=411)|
| 0:06:58| we just wanted to take a few moments today to review the purpose of the plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| and the process and how we will approach presenting a staff's recommendation on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| So plan developments are intended to encourage and allow more creative and flexible development of land than is possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| under district zoning regulations and should only be applied to further those applications that provide compensated amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| and benefits to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| The underlying zoning district dimensional design and use regulations apply to a plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| unless specifically modified through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| To be granted such exceptions, the applicant must demonstrate superior design and enhanced amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=453)|
| 0:07:39| In no case may an exception to the district regulations be granted unless the applicant demonstrates a substantial benefit to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| So PD is intended to encourage flexibility in the development of land and the design of structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| It is to encourage a more creative approach to the use of land that results in better development and design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| than might otherwise be accomplished under strict application of other sections of this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| Plan development is to allow for the design of developments that are architecturally and environmentally innovative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| and that achieve better utilization of land than is possible through the strict application of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| Combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms, and structural visual relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| with an environment that allows mixing of different uses in an innovative and functionally efficient manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| and provide for the efficient use of land to facilitate a more effective arrangement of land use structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| circulation patterns, and utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| Encourage land development that to the greatest extent possible preserves natural vegetation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| respects natural topographic and geological conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| and refrains from adversely affecting flooding, soil drainage, and other natural ecological conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| The plan development process is a multi-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| On Thursday, you will be asked to review and consider a recommendation to Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| for a preliminary development plan for the multi-use, mixed-use stadium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| This will be the first of two reviews for this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| So if approved by City Council, the project will come back to Planning Commission for a final plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| And according to 16.7E3B, the Planning Commission will review the application based upon evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| presented at the public meeting pursuant to the approval standards that Michelle will review with you in just a few moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=555)|
| 0:09:22| And the Planning Commission must recommend either approval, approval with conditions, or modifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| or deny the preliminary development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| So it's similar to concept plans and other applications that you all review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| And given the significance of this project, we will not be reviewing the details of the plan development application today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=574)|
| 0:09:41| but we'll provide ample time on Thursday for the applicants to present their project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| staff to share with you their recommendation, and for any additional Q&A that you might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| or members of the public might want to bring forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| So I'm going to turn it over to Michelle now, who's going to review the criteria this body is charged with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| utilizing to make a recommendation for this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| Okay, so as Amy was saying, 16.7 pertains to plan developments in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| There's three sections that you all will be looking at specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| when evaluating the plan development application that's before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| The most general standards are grouped under 16.7.E.3.E, and those are very general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=618)|
| 0:10:26| Then there's a subset that kind of talks about public amenities, site design characteristics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| and then there's a third subset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| It's exceptions for criteria or criteria for exceptions to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=634)|
| 0:10:40| So the first criteria under the approval process is a lot of what Amy was just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=640)|
| 0:10:48| It kind of refers you back to Section 16.7.A, and so it's kind of looking at that intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| and trying to see whether the application actually meets that intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| So that's talking about flexibility and development of land, the creative approach to the use of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| architectural styles, things of that nature, protecting the environment, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| So the second bullet under the approval standards for preliminary plans is that it will not be injurious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| to the use and enjoyment of other property in the vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| And so you're going to be looking at things like compatible uses, the physical environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| traffic flow, parking demand, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| But then every application or all developments have to comply with Section 10.5 in the city's ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| which talks about environmental performance standards, noise, glare, vibration, pollution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| hazardous waste, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| So unless they've asked for an exception, it would be required to comply with all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| The third bullet point under the approval standards of preliminary plans is that it will not impede| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| the normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| And so things that would come to mind would be making other properties less appealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| by lowering property values, making it difficult to access other properties, incompatible uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| something that would make someone not want to use the property around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| The fourth bullet is there is a provision for adequate utilities and infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| drainage, off-street parking and loading, pedestrian access, and all other necessary facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=732)|
| 0:12:20| The next bullet is there is provision for adequate vehicular ingress and egress designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| to minimize traffic congestion upon public streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| The Planning Commission and or City Council may require a traffic study to provide evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| that the circulation system is adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| And the final one is the location and arrangement of structures, parking areas, walks, landscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| lighting, and other site design elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| And the uses are compatible with the surrounding neighborhood and adjacent uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| So that's all the general approval standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| And then kind of going into that substandard or that subset of standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| which is point G in your staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| So this is talking about this particular one is 16.7.D.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=778)|
| 0:13:05| And this is referring back to the public amenity examples and site and design characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| And so the first sentence is talking about how you can deviate from those to get an exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=790)|
| 0:13:16| and then also the design characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| So it gives a number of examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| So going into point A, community gathering spaces and amenities including plazas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| public art, formal gardens, places to congregate and pedestrian and transit facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=806)|
| 0:13:33| Point B, improvement of existing and on-site and off-site infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=813)|
| 0:13:40| Use of sustainable design and architecture such as green roofs, white roofs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| and other energy efficient design concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| New building technologies and approval of buildings and developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| that meet the established standards such as LEED, Energy Star, Earthcraft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| Preservation of existing environmental features including additional protections for steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| Preservation of historic features and adaptive reuse of existing buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| New open space and recreational amenities such as recreational open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| including parks and playgrounds, natural water features and conservation areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| jogging trails and fitness courses, dog parks, skate parks, and similar recreational features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=853)|
| 0:14:20| Provision of public car and or bike share facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| Affordable housing set-asides that must comply with other standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| And senior housing set-asides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| This is not an all-inclusive list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| This is just an example of things that could be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| And then the last subset is the criteria for granting exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| And so it says planned development is subject to the underlying district dimensional design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| and use regulations unless an exception is specifically granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| The Planning Commission may recommend and City Council may grant exceptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| to the zoning district dimensional design and use regulations where a planned development is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| Exceptions from district regulations may be granted for planned developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| if the exceptions enhance the overall merit of the planned development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| promote the objectives of both the city and the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| enhance the quality of the design and the structures in the site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| will not cause excessive adverse impact on neighboring properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| are compatible with the adopted Knoxville-Knox County General Plan and its component parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| including sector plans, quarter plans, and related documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| and provide a public benefit to the city as provided below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| And that's the ones that we just went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| So there's a subgroup for granting exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| So the ones that they've asked for, you'll need to ask yourself if it meets these criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| And then for the design, you'll need to ask yourself if the site design meets those criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| And then the approval overall or the other bullet points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| So I just want to make sure that's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| If there are any questions, I'm happy to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| Prior to this meeting, I sent these slides to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| and I also have a handout that has the entirety of this section of the zoning code with it highlighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| so not only do you have the standards, but you can kind of understand where they fit within that section of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=960)|
| 0:16:07| All right. That's it. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| Anybody have any comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| I've got one real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| I think it may make sense when we do our quarterly meeting or annual meeting or whatever we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=976)|
| 0:16:23| because these probably are going to be a little controversial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| because you're trying to kind of push the edges of introducing new uses in a particular area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=986)|
| 0:16:33| that's not potentially zoned for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| and there's a lot of other things that you've got to do to meet this criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| I think it would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| I think sometimes we lose sight of how much work goes into the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| Like you all meet with these folks several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| You get several go back and forths between engineers or architects or the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1013)|
| 0:17:02| We just see the end result of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| Because you have to do a preliminary meeting to even get a plan development going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| you all have to see it, understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| I think it would be helpful for you to take one that's been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| or one that you're going through and just kind of give these pictorial examples of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| hey, this is what we got when we got it originally submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| These are the comments we had back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| This was the first take of how this thing was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| This is how we started and where we ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| And to just give everybody some comfort that there's a lot that goes into these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1054)|
| 0:17:40| It's not that somebody's just trying to slide something in without a lot of go back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| I think that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| We can absolutely do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| And I would say that it might be beneficial to show you all how we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| It's not just the plan development application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| but also all the other applications that we receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| There's a lot of back and forth that goes on between us and applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Our next subject is number five, street and alley closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| Michelle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| Skip down to that slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1097)|
| 0:18:24| Okay, so there's two rights-of-way closures before you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| They're related, so we'll just kind of talk about them all at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| These are related to rezoning cases that you all heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| I believe it was back in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| And the applicant was asking for RN6 for this large property in the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| and then the three blocks coming down south from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| And both of those, the rezoning request, the one-year plan request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| and the sector plan amendment request, all of those were denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| And so we're recommending denial of the rights-of-way closures as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| just to protect those rights-of-way, keep them open, pending future development pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| These rights-of-way still could service these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| especially the extension of Kate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| And so if a developer came in with plans that wouldn't include them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| they could request closure at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| But right now we are recommending for us to retain both of those rights-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| Just to give you the context of the general neighborhood, it's an older neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| It developed pre-World War II, so there's existing alleyways all throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| Some developed, some not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| The existing zoning is RN2 on the southern properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| or I guess all the properties surrounding the rights-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| And then you can see that there are examples in the nearby vicinity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| where the alleys have been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| And so if these properties were developed and keeping the alleys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| it would definitely be in character with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| And so that's why we're recommending denial of both of those cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| I'm going to open up to see if there's any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| You're just talking about which item were you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| I'm sorry, this is numbers five and six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| Five and six, not seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| So I guess we can discuss five and six now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| Nobody has any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| We're going to move on to number seven, and that will be Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| Okay, so I'll start this one off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| So 11 is not with us this week, so both Gene and I will cover his cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| So number seven is 9A21SC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| It's Benchmark Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| This is a right-of-way closure for a public street that intersects Cherokee Boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| and dead ends into Sequoia Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| It is called Lakeland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| Our staff is recommending approval of the closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| subject to providing a 15-foot wide easement requested by the city's engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| for public access to the park and any other easements, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| that are specified by KUB or other departments that review these along with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| So as you can see up here on the map, that's the request there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| And I will say that in conversations with Director Cannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| that this is the way that they will approach future right-of-way closures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| or access points or dead ends into a public resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| There will be an attempt to identify some type of easement to ensure that that access continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1277)|
| 0:21:26| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| Is that a right-of-way or is that a public street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| A public street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| Well, I've got some comments, but maybe I ought to save them for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| Do we know, is the applicant planning on keeping a sort of opening for residents to be able to access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1305)|
| 0:21:53| Commissioner, could you pull it a little bit closer? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| Do we know if the applicant's planning on keeping like an opening for residents to be able to access the park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| That is a condition of the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| is that they will be required to provide a 15-foot easement that will be maintained by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| So is that how this case differs from the one that we heard two months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| where there was a controversy over access to a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| there was a citizen who wanted to close that road, and I believe that was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| It was denied, and it's currently on appeal at City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| And so I will say that this one has a lot of similarities to that request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| and so our department and city engineering have been having a lot of conversations on how to handle these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1357)|
| 0:22:43| and this is where we've landed on addressing these right-of-way closures that dent into a public asset like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1363)|
| 0:22:50| So it is very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| And so just to say it back to make sure I've got it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| the agreement that you're coming to is that closures can be conducted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1374)|
| 0:23:01| but there has to be still a 15-foot easement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| It might vary depending on the request and the location of the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| but there will be a consideration to examine whether or not a public access or pedestrian easement makes sense for each of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1389)|
| 0:23:18| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| Thank you, Gene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| No more comments, no more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| So we'll move on to rezonings and plan amendments, and number 12, Gene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1409)|
| 0:23:36| Let me get a little A.V. help here from Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1416)|
| 0:23:46| All right, this one's a little bit challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| The applicant's requesting to rezone the property to office from the current RN-4 general residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| The property is located on Chambliss Avenue between Kingston Pike to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| and Sutherland Avenue to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| This is a transitional area between commercial development along Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| and adjacent single-family residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| As you can see from the zoning map, it's currently a mix of office and single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| Many of the single-family residences have been converted to office uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| You can see here several properties located along Chambliss have been rezoned to office already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1460)|
| 0:24:27| Looking at the sector plan, you can see this entire area is also located within a mixed-use special district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| Bearden Village, and that encourages a mix of residential, commercial, office, and other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| Public input during the planning process indicated the desire to preserve affordable housing in walkable areas like this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1479)|
| 0:24:46| Here you have shopping and employment opportunities within walking distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| and regular transit service along Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| This is a street view of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| You can see it's located in a block of single-family homes on relatively small lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| and as mentioned, some of those homes have been previously converted for office use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1502)|
| 0:25:09| This property does not meet the minimum required lot size or lot width for the office zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| As you see here, it's only 7,500 square feet versus the minimum requirement of 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| and the lot's only 50 feet wide versus the required minimum width of 60 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| So approving the request of rezoning would therefore create a nonconforming property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| Other properties on this block that were designated office were zoned under the previous city zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| which required a minimum of 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1535)|
| 0:25:42| One reason the dimensional standards are important is because the small size of this lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| significantly limits the ability to provide the 20-foot buffer yard that's required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| when a nonresidential district abuts a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1551)|
| 0:25:58| This picture shows you why meeting those Class B buffer yard requirements would be extremely difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| Our property that we're looking at is located to the left, and the adjoining single-family home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| which would become the new district boundary for RN-4, is located to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| So that boundary between the two zoning districts would begin between these two homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| and they're currently separated by a 10-foot driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| So a 20-foot buffer yard would be pretty difficult to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| So the staff recommendation is to deny since the property doesn't meet dimensional requirements for the office district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| and that also limits the ability to meet requirements for parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| and for the buffering from the adjacent residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| Glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| I noticed in the comments from staff that, and I remembered this one from 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1602)|
| 0:26:49| and it seems, if not similar, identical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| So Thursday, I would like to know if there are any differentiations from the one in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1613)|
| 0:27:01| because I believe there was a recommendation to deny in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| and I think we approved the rezoning request in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| That was one of these parcels near the spot right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| Same street, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| Further down towards the north there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| I just remember a debate going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| I think Gerald was present at that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| and there seemed to be a push for more affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| seemed to be comments from staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| and then there was some debate about let the market decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| So I think we can talk about a lot of that on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| but I sure would like to know if there are significant differences in those two rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1668)|
| 0:27:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Let's move on to number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1686)|
| 0:28:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| This is number nine, 8G21RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| It's located on the south side of Beaver Creek Drive, east of Evanelle Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| It's located within the parental responsibility zone for Powell Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| and is within a half mile west of the commercial corridor along Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1721)|
| 0:28:48| In this image here, you can see the flood zone for Beaver Creek is near the frontage of this property along Beaver Creek Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1728)|
| 0:28:57| The applicant is requesting to rezone from agriculture to planned residential up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1737)|
| 0:29:07| This is the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| You can see that the subject property is adjacent to the RA zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| which is the county's low-density residential zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| and that allows consideration of lots down to 10,000 square feet when serviced by sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1757)|
| 0:29:25| This is the sector plan for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| So you can see the property lies within the LDR, low-density residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| It's also adjacent to Powell Levi Park, which you see here in the green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1772)|
| 0:29:38| And just to the east here is the Clinton Highway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1778)|
| 0:29:48| This is an image demonstrating lot sizes in the general area overlaid on the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1788)|
| 0:29:56| So the subject property here is in blue, and the adjacent subdivision here is Lazy Acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| We'll look at that a little bit more closely in the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| And then this property down here is a planned residential zoned neighborhood called Beachwood Estates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| It's approximately nine acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| And the average lot size in this neighborhood is 9,500 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| and their front yard setbacks are about 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| This is a blow-up of that neighborhood so you can see it in a little bit more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| This shows Google Street View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| Again, this is the planned residential neighborhood that we just talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| that is west of the subject property, Beachwood Estates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| This is what it looks like at 2.8 dwelling units an acre that this area was approved for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1842)|
| 0:30:50| And this is the adjacent Lazy Acres subdivision next to the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| It has RA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| However, the lot sizes in Lazy Acres are about 23,500 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| and their front yard setbacks are about 60 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| Or sorry, 60 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| And some of the public comments that we've received were concerns regarding visibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| along West Beaver Creek Drive for the subject property's access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| The highlighted area you see here shows where the approximate location of the frontage is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1883)|
| 0:31:31| So you can see this is the top view here is facing west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| and then the bottom view here is facing east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| And this is actually along the frontage with the Lazy Acres subdivision facing east toward Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1901)|
| 0:31:51| This is an aerial map showing the adjacent sort of build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1911)|
| 0:31:59| Staff's recommendation for this is 3.5 dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| which is more compatible with the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| And because this rezoning is for planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| a subsequent use on review application will be required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| at which time the applicant will need to work with Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| to ensure that pre-development flow rates are maintained post-construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1939)|
| 0:32:27| So they will be required to work with stormwater during the planned residential approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1947)|
| 0:32:35| We've had quite a few comments about stormwater, so I just wanted to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| Any questions about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| How wide is that track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| It's pretty narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| I mean, you couldn't double-serve that while it's on a road, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| Yeah. Here, let's see if I can pull up the…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1976)|
| 0:33:12| I don't go to a lot of trouble. I can figure it out later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=1994)|
| 0:33:21| 219 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| 219 feet approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| It's kind of narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| All right. Number 16, Liz, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| So this is 9I21RZ and 9B21SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| This is the southeast side of the intersection of Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| and Marietta Church Road, again, the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| The subject property is across the street from two use-on-review applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2038)|
| 0:34:05| that we currently have on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| which you see the hatch marks just to the north there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| The applicant is requesting to go from agriculture and CA zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2054)|
| 0:34:21| to rural commercial and planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2061)|
| 0:34:30| So because of that request, they also have sector plan amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| that they're asking for that would go from agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| and low-density residential hillside protection to rural commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| and low-density residential and hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| This shows the zoning map at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| So you can see the existing CA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| When we discuss Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| we always note that a large percentage of Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| is actually within the rural area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| And while CA is not recommended in rural areas because of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2104)|
| 0:35:12| this CA zoning actually predates the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| This is an image from the 1950s zoning map of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| showing the intersection with Marietta Church Road and Hardin Valley Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| You can see the CA zoning has been in that area since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2127)|
| 0:35:38| This is what the sector plan looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| The sector plan was updated in 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| and staff did not recognize the commercial zoning at this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| because it was CA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| The area was shown as what the existing land use classification was at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| and it was primarily vacant, agricultural, and forested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2158)|
| 0:36:05| So it shows up as agricultural in the land use plan for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| However, there have been two recent rezonings that have happened here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| So you can see the LDR in these two adjacent neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| that aren't entirely built out yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| This is the zoning map sort of zoomed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| The applicant is actually requesting that this small section here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| go to rural commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| as well as rural commercial land use plan designation for the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2198)|
| 0:36:46| And then outside of that, they're asking for this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| to go to planned residential up to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| Staff, however, is recommending up to two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| And you can see through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| they have a larger area that's actually currently zoned CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| and has been that way for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| So they're asking for a portion of that CA zoning to go to planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| So they would be extending commercial zoning along Hardin Valley Road here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2237)|
| 0:37:24| but it would be the rural commercial zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| not an extension of the CA zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| This shows the roundabout that's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| The subject property is this is Marietta Church Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| that you see on the east side here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| And then west of there is I forget the name of this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2262)|
| 0:37:49| It was recently approved for a roundabout at the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| with East Gullahar Ferry Road and Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| So this is one of the changes to conditions in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| that staff thinks makes this a little bit more viable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| as a rural commercial area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| and additional low-density residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| The slope analysis recommended 2.24 dwelling units an acre at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2293)|
| 0:38:21| We ran the slope analysis just for the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| that they're requesting to go to planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| Again, this is summarizing the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| The applicant was asking for up to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| Staff is recommending up to two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| and staff is also recommending an extension of the rural commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2318)|
| 0:38:46| but as rural commercial zoning at this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| with the associated sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| I'm sure there probably are, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| No questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| Not on your list, but we're adding number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| And Liz, I think you're going to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| So this is along Ball Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| and it is just outside of the Shod Road Improvement Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2360)|
| 0:39:27| This image shows a sector plan designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| and you can see that the Shod Road improvements are shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| as having a mixed-use special district in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| and then across the street from this is where the subject property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| The north side of Ball Road is primarily zoned RA and PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2384)|
| 0:39:51| with densities closer to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| The planned residential zones up to five dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| are primarily within the mixed-use special district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| surrounding the Shod Road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| And then as you can see with the slope analysis on the next slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| the rear portion of this property is very steeply sloped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| so when we run a slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| it gives us a recommendation of 2.68 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| So staff is recommending up to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| That's more in line with the slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| and the character of the development on this side of Ball Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| and what the current zoning is for this side of Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| However, the applicant is requesting up to five dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| and will request likely that we discuss this at the meeting on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2440)|
| 0:40:47| Yes, this one's currently on a consent list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| and it will be pulled off the consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| That's the reason we added it to the agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| On to uses on review and special uses, number 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| Mike Reynolds is going to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2467)|
| 0:41:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| This is the Walker Springs Villas request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| This property was rezoned earlier this year, this spring and summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| to PR up to 7.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| And this is on Walker Springs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| It's adjacent to an existing apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| and within a much larger predominantly single-family residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2506)|
| 0:41:53| This property was always part of the adjacent single-family neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| or was originally part of the property, but it was never developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| It does have some unique characteristics to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| It has some major gas lines that run through the property, both on the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2526)|
| 0:42:12| One runs on the south side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| One runs along the frontage of East Meadcrest Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2534)|
| 0:42:20| So it does create some challenges for the developer just for accessing the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2540)|
| 0:42:27| and where they can place structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| Those major pipelines do have some pretty substantial requirements for crossing them with driveways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2549)|
| 0:42:37| and also easements that they need to stay out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| The site plan itself, it's all detached single-family structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2562)|
| 0:42:49| There's 12 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| It is all in one lot, though, so it's kind of like a condo style, single-family development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| single parking lot in the middle of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| So East Meadcrest Drive is on the south of this image, so it's really the west side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| And Walker Springs is up here on the left side of this image, but it's north of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2585)|
| 0:43:14| What is kind of hard to see here is that these parking stalls that are closest to the main road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2594)|
| 0:43:20| are actually within a structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| It's like a one-story parking garage structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| This is what it's kind of intended to look like, semi-residential looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2607)|
| 0:43:34| so it doesn't look too much like a parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| But the intent that the applicant had with this is to try to block the view of the parking lot that's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2617)|
| 0:43:46| do something to try to soften the look there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| There is going to be landscape between the garage and the street, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| to help soften the structure from the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| but I just wanted to point that out because it is kind of hard to see in the plan what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2638)|
| 0:44:06| A couple of challenges that they're dealing with, another challenge that they're dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| besides the gas line easements, is a pretty substantial drainage swale that comes through the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2652)|
| 0:44:20| starting here at the intersection of Walker Springs and East Meadcrest Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| Right now it kind of cuts through the property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| They're going to have to reroute it around the property because of how much water it carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| They're going to have to have a larger easement than typical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| which could impact the location of these structures here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| They may have to move them further away from their property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| But outside of just the drainage swale, there's two potential sinkholes on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2684)|
| 0:44:52| One is shown on the site plan by the dog park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| This one, I believe, opened up as they were removing some trees on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| The other one is not shown on the site plan but is located approximately here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2702)|
| 0:45:09| They did have a geotech study completed on the site where they drilled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| wasn't at the locations of the two potential sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| but their analysis of the soils basically has concluded that there wasn't any indication of sinkhole activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2718)|
| 0:45:26| on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| When they get to permitting, they will have to evaluate those sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| They can't just rely on the study that's done as of right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| So since they're waiting to do that study after this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| if that does come back and show that they are sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| either they're going to have to remove some structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| and potentially reduce their unit count or come back with a new plan that takes that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2752)|
| 0:46:05| The other major item in the staff report is the peripheral setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| and I just kind of wanted to step through real quick some rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| It shouldn't impact their project much, but I just want to kind of point these out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2774)|
| 0:46:21| The peripheral setback, what I'm going to call the rear of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| but really against the apartment complex, this is the one that I'm not recommending change to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| They're requesting a 15-foot peripheral setback there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| The standard setback is 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| This backs up to the parking lot of the apartment complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| and there's really no reason to require a very large setback there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2800)|
| 0:46:47| They're not really impacting anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| The only issue is their drainage swale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| They may have to potentially move those buildings a little bit further away than they had hoped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| but that's a design plan or permitting stage issue that they're going to have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2817)|
| 0:47:04| The other peripheral setbacks, I'll go to what I'm going to call the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| Again, it's kind of like a rear, but they're proposing a 15-foot peripheral setback on this line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2830)|
| 0:47:17| This is an adjacent detached residential house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| One good thing here is that that house does sit pretty far away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| but as you can see in the site plan, they're 20-plus, like 25-some odd feet away here already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2844)|
| 0:47:34| I think they're 29 feet away, so there's really no need to reduce all the way to a 15-foot peripheral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2854)|
| 0:47:41| suggesting a 25-foot peripheral setback here, which will still give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2861)|
| 0:47:48| They won't have to change their plan in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| They could keep it, but at least ensures that during the permitting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| those don't start shifting towards that south property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| You can also see here that they have an east Tennessee natural gas line easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| that extends 15 feet into their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| so really they were requesting the peripheral setback to match the gas line easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| so the suggested 25-foot setback will just add 10 feet onto that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2890)|
| 0:48:17| and push those houses a little bit further away from that gas line easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| They're requesting a 20-foot peripheral setback on both street frontages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| the East Meadcrest Drive and also Walker Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| Their building, their closest structure is 24 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| I'm suggesting to go ahead and just require a 25-foot peripheral setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2915)|
| 0:48:41| The adjacent house to the south, let me see if I can bring that up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| I believe it's about 42 feet, if I recall correctly, from their front property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| so the new house would project a bit further into that front yard space than the adjacent house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2931)|
| 0:48:58| But because of the distance away, I'm not too concerned with it looking out of character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2938)|
| 0:49:04| and if they're able to provide some kind of landscaping between their structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| and the gas line easement, then that would help a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| but they can't put anything within that gas line easement, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| That's no vegetation or anything, otherwise it's going to get ripped out by the gas line company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| So on Walker Springs Drive, again, they're requesting a 20-foot peripheral setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2960)|
| 0:49:29| but I'm recommending the 35-foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| It's a collector road, and really, on their plan, they're showing dedication to right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2972)|
| 0:49:39| which they're not going to have to do because this is a one-lot subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| By not dedicating the right-of-way and by what their setback of their existing structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2984)|
| 0:49:51| or what their proposed structures are, they're already outside of the 35-foot peripheral setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| so there's really no need to approve a reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=2996)|
| 0:50:06| They do have a landscape plan in their packet, so feel free to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3006)|
| 0:50:13| I didn't really have any major comments on that other than to note that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3013)|
| 0:50:19| potentially they could add some landscaping over here on the south side of those houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| but I didn't make that a recommendation of the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| Just FYI, if you haven't seen some of the comments on this one, stormwater is a pretty big topic on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3029)|
| 0:50:37| so I'm sure we'll hear more about that at the planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3037)|
| 0:50:46| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| What is the spacing between the units and how wide are the units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3048)|
| 0:50:58| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| They do show spacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3059)|
| 0:51:06| So they're showing 18 feet between the units kind of behind, I guess closest to the apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3066)|
| 0:51:13| It's 10 feet between these two units, and I think it's 10 feet between the others as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| Yep, 10 feet here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| And how wide are the units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| Let me see if I've got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| I can let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| I don't know off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| I mean, there are smaller units than typical, so, I mean, if this is 18 feet, it's not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| These units here are not much wider than 18 feet, maybe a little over 20 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| That's what I was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| I have one comment, and that is, and I've talked to Amy about this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| but I feel like our peripheral setbacks are intended to protect adjoining neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3114)|
| 0:52:03| If you develop a property next to a neighborhood, that peripheral setback should be there to buffer the neighbors that we adjoin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3123)|
| 0:52:12| when we approve these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| And when we adjoin roads, that should be a front yard setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| and I don't think peripheral should be applied to public right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| I mean, that's a public road, and it could be considered a corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| And Amy and I have talked about it, and everybody shoots me down on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| but I still feel like that peripheral is not intended to protect the road right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3152)|
| 0:52:39| and in some cases I think it's starting to be used to allow the county a little more leeway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3159)|
| 0:52:45| in case they have to take some property in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| But anyway, I just want to make that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| I'm not going to make an issue of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| I've always had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| That's just one of those things that I think about sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| It might be something that we can add to the agenda when we do our workshop as planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| so we can have a bigger discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| All right, any other comments or questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| So I guess based off of stormwater concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| I know a few months ago the concept they presented was like house on stilts, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| Do you or engineering feel that the underground detention basin is sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3205)|
| 0:53:33| to cover any possible stormwater problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| I haven't heard anything from engineering particularly about the underground detention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3219)|
| 0:53:46| and whether or not that will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| A lot of those details get ironed out during the permitting phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| once they know more about the property and the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| A lot of the stormwater issue is the water that runs just through the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| not necessarily generated by the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| This was a pretty well-vegetated property before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3244)|
| 0:54:10| and they've already gone in and cleared a good portion of the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| They still have left some because that's kind of what they're hoping to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| is keep as many of the mature trees as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| But after they cleared the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| that's when some of the neighbors were starting to experience more stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| coming through the site and then through their property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| So that's really the big concern is water that's just running through the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| and how it's now traveling faster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| and seems to be in more quantity than it had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| So then I guess it would be handled, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| during permitting similar to the sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| and if it presents to be a problem, they might have to alter their site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| Yeah, there's a good chance they would have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| I mean, they could just eliminate some units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| and keep the same general site plan and we could just review that as staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3298)|
| 0:55:05| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| Okay, number 24 and Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| So this is what used to be called the Cherokee Farm Research Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3317)|
| 0:55:24| and now it's being rebranded as UT Research Park at Cherokee Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3324)|
| 0:55:33| So this is the front page of the new revised guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3333)|
| 0:55:41| I guess I'm going to just bring up a presentation format real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3341)|
| 0:55:49| and I don't expect you to read this, but the bullets there, 1 through 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| they're in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| but basically it's just outlining what the different items that are being revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| The first thing is this being rebranded, like I said, to UT Research Park at Cherokee Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3362)|
| 0:56:09| They're re-designating some of the existing quad open spaces for service parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| and to provide more flexibility and location of parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| or parking within each building lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| and I'll go over that in just a little bit more, what they're wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| But a big thing is that their original vision for this park was to be a pretty dense research park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3385)|
| 0:56:35| They're hoping to create or build parking structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| and that's going to support a more dense research park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| Over time, the park is developing out in a different way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| than they originally anticipated with more surface parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| because they just can't afford to do the structured parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| That is then now requiring more area dedicated to parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| and I'll show you what their plan is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| Overall, they do anticipate the square footage, building square footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| to go from about 1.6 million square feet to about 940,000 square feet of floor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3427)|
| 0:57:16| Subsequently, the parking reduction is about 4,000 to about 2,350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3436)|
| 0:57:25| They revised the sustainability development guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3445)|
| 0:57:33| The state changed how they approached those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| Then they deleted a section, an appendix that dealt with entrance plazas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3458)|
| 0:57:44| It really wasn't all that necessary of a section within the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3464)|
| 0:57:51| Revised the building height standards to say that the building height is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3471)|
| 0:57:58| it just references the city's zoning ordinance and how they measure building height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3478)|
| 0:58:04| Something that is going to be a potential revision that staff has recommended at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| is to go ahead and acknowledge that the building heights in this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| are restricted by the state of highway law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| I'll call highways a state-designated scenic route or scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| There are building height limitations on those streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| so I haven't had a chance to talk to the applicant yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| about bringing those standards into the, or at least acknowledging those standards within the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| But it has been a condition of the previous approvals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3517)|
| 0:58:45| that the development has to meet the state highway standards anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| And then the last one is probably the biggest change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| and something that I'm going to go over some staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| And again, this is something that I have not had a chance to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| and talk to the applicant about yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| So depending on how they feel about the proposed standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| they may just recommend postponement for one more month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| so we have more opportunity to discuss those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| So basically what they're doing is consolidating the different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| there were two different sections in the master plan before that dealt with signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| One was site signage that dealt with predominantly signs related to the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| and wayfinding, getting people to where they need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| Then they had building-related signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| So now they're just consolidating that into one section, easier to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3577)|
| 0:59:44| And the original BP1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3584)|
| 0:59:51| so this property is what we call a previously planned district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3591)|
| 0:59:58| or had previously planned district zoning on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| which the new zoning ordinance points you back to the old zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| which was the BP1 zone, business park zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| And the BP1 zone had a 100-square-foot sign limitation on it for each building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3610)|
| 1:00:16| and it limited wall signs to just one wall sign per building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3616)|
| 1:00:22| In 2000, late 2019, early 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| they had a revision of the master plan approved by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| that increased the size of the signs to meet whatever the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| to meet the current city wall sign standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| but it did not remove the requirement to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| or the limitation of just one wall sign per building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| So that's one of the items that they're going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| or they are proposing to amend to allow more than just one wall sign per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| And I'll go over my recommendations in just a sec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| So this is going to be, I'll try to zoom in just a little bit on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| but this is the previous plan, and this is the current proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3665)|
| 1:01:23| I will just go to the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| It'll be easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| The current plan has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3689)|
| 1:01:35| oops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3695)|
| 1:01:41| has quads that are called out, and this has pretty much been original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| The quads between the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| and this plan has been modified slightly through the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| but the intent was put parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| surface parking behind the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| try to create parking along the external boundary of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| You still see one parking structure in this current proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| but with this, with the new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| and also this over here has changed too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| so just keep an eye on that on the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| With those quads are predominantly going to go away in this new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| The quads are going away in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| and they will be replaced by parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3747)|
| 1:02:34| Predominantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| Let me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| if I can get this pulled up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| So this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| this is a private development and they were intent on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| was to have a high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| a high end research park that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| address a lot of environmental challenges from the site and kept a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| address a lot of environmental challenges from the site and kept a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| the flood plain along the river intact and any type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| archeological areas along the river that could be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| could be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| So they're concentrating everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| well away from the river and up towards the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| on the higher elevations and towards Alcoa highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| So as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| a lot of the quads have turned into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| or are being requested to propose a surface parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| technically they could stay as a quad if they're able to keep it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| It's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| doesn't mean that it's going to have to turn into surface parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| but only a small portion like the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| on the river side of these quads that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| that is being proposed to stay as part of the open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| quad system there on the east side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| or I guess this would be south technically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| but they are proposing some realignment of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| of uses on that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| There's really nothing proposed there yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| but they're just kind of showing on the master plan what their current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| thought is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| That's the obvious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| they'll bring those development plans forward later on whenever they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| have those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| But any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| the only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| the only buildings that exist are the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| are this building here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| and this one's under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| So I'd like to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| Is this land owned by the state or is it privately owned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| I think it's a complicated question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| If I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| I think it's owned by a state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| but it was donated to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| to the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| And I know there were some caveats to that donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| I just want to know what the current status of all that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| If it's owned by the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| how much control does the city or the county have over that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3900)|
| 1:05:06| Because we don't look at anything on the UT campus when they build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3906)|
| 1:05:13| So I'm wondering if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| and I was told years ago that things that came through from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| we reviewed it as a courtesy and that they weren't actually bound by it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3922)|
| 1:05:30| but they tried to conform with the city and county as a courtesy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| but they weren't actually bound by our decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| So all of this that we're going through with this plan development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| that's why I ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| is it state-owned property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| If it was private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| that would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| But it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| It's state-owned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| Like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| this one is a little bit more complicated than most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| and I'm sure we can get an answer for you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| But this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| these properties do require the city of Knoxville's permitting office to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| approve building permits on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| I'm not sure if that's the same case on the UT campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| I don't have any idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| But we can clarify the ownership question and the other details related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| to permitting and why the city is permitting these for Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| It would just make a lot of difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| It seems that they want to comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| They're going through the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| So I think anything reasonable they're going to work with us on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| wouldn't you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| I just have a general question, and it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| it's moot if the answer is one thing and it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| has some legs if it is another answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| But it seems like from your description and some of the changes that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4016)|
| 1:07:03| being requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| that we're starting from a really robust architectural design plan for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| this research area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| And these are working to really water down the kind of consistency that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4034)|
| 1:07:20| that plan has implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| Like if all of a sudden now you don't have just a singular sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| but now you can have four signs and like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| does it become a jumble of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| of different things as opposed to this very consistent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| robust design plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| And my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| this is just my perception of what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| is happening is, you know, what, one of the first buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| I guess the first building was a joint Institute, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| kind of a research structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| And I think they were originally hoping to get a lot more of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| dedicated research type uses here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| And they typically don't have any business or any type of institution in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| there that really advertises themselves that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| And so having one sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| a small sign and having directional signage throughout the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| was probably ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| It was fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| But their type of institutions or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| companies that they have going in there now are more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| more private related or maybe like quasi public private and have more want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4107)|
| 1:08:35| and potential need for, for signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| They want to get their name out there and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| and be seen and be known that they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| Get people to their location as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| That it's not just people working at the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| but people who aren't familiar with the development that need to get there as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| And on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| just leaned over to our legal counsel and just said if she could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| just to pull up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| because what I think everybody's referencing to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| UT is that goes through the state building commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| because that is public funds that is being expended through THEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| It has to be approved through the state building commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| While this may be public property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| it's private funds used to build buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| which may be why it's going through the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| So I think if we just get some clarification on how all of that's working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| it would help everybody understand why the research part may be going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| through what Mike's been explaining with the permitting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| the billing signs and all that under city code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| whereas everything else on UT probably doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| Given that we need some of those answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| And you said that you were still trying to discuss some of these matters with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| Do we want to go ahead and postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| Do you want what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| Do we want to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| I think that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| I'd love to hear Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| Discuss that on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| I'd love to just hear all of the discussion, the person who, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| the presenter and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| And if they request a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| then I think we could consider it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| Number 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4222)|

| 1:10:26| Before I get totally off of the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4226)|
| 1:10:44| We'll be getting up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| Well, you may be getting a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| A draft signage to be presented on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| a draft signage standards for me just showing or giving some maximum sign sizes for different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4252)|
| 1:11:03| elevations while signage just to help staff know what is appropriate, where and when because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4263)|
| 1:11:13| signage would typically come through a staff review and as long as it meets the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| and meets the intent of the guidelines then we can approve those things, otherwise it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| would have to come back to the Planning Commission for a separate review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4281)|
| 1:11:28| This last one I've got for 9C21SU, Stephanie Walther, it's technically a campground is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4288)|
| 1:11:39| what they're requesting, it is zoned ag, it is in the city, it's in the northwest part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4299)|
| 1:11:45| of the city off of Amherst, Amherst is just off to the east, but it's, this is property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4305)|

| 1:11:59| to the south which is zoned RN1 and it does, you have to get up to Piney Grove Lane or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4319)|
| 1:12:07| Church Road before you kind of get to an access point where you can get into the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| and then back up to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| They are asking for three campsites, let me pull up the plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4335)|
| 1:12:26| So this is the property, you see the railroad tracks to the east, there's a house that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4346)|
| 1:12:34| applicant currently lives in on the site, the driveway coming in on the southwest side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| of the property, a parking area near the house for the clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| The first campsite location is the southeast corner of the property, then they have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4364)|
| 1:12:50| campsite locations in the northwest corner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| The one in the southeast is closest to an adjacent residential house which is just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| the, just off this page, I can show you a map in a moment, but they are required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4380)|
| 1:13:06| put in landscape screening buffering between campsites and adjacent or adjacent residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4386)|
| 1:13:14| properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| What you're seeing here, it's kind of hard to see, but in green is that they would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| to install additional landscape screening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| Existing trees can count, existing vegetation can count towards that buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4405)|
| 1:13:30| And also to, because this campsite could potentially be visible from houses to the west, they also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4410)|
| 1:13:35| need to make sure that they have the appropriate landscape buffering between the campsite and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| There is a pretty good tree line here, which they can count, and there might be a few other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4419)|
| 1:13:46| trees here and there on the property, but those details will be handled during the permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4426)|

| 1:13:53| The properties to the northwest of the site are pretty well vegetated between themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| and the residential properties to the southwest, so more than likely they're not going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| to add really anything up in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4442)|

| 1:14:46| They originally were hoping to be able to do some campsites up in that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| but they found out the ag zone in the county wouldn't allow it, they probably need the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| open space zone, so I think they're trying to evaluate how to approach this going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4495)|
| 1:15:01| My understanding from the applicant is really they did not intend to do three sites on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| city zone piece of property, but this is the only option at this point, so there's a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| chance that if they did get approval for three, they may move one or two of those off this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4509)|
| 1:15:16| site up into the county portion if they can get that approved, but that, you know, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| going forward with the city property with three campsites because this is their only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| option at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4528)|
| 1:15:34| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4534)|
| 1:15:40| I think, unless you have any questions, I can just show you what their intents are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| They're going to be fairly well-structured tent sites, they're not going to be sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| where people come and bring their own tents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| They are fully stocked with, you know, the beds, the seating, the campfire, the fire pits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4551)|
| 1:15:58| all the things that you would need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| You just need to bring some of your own personal supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| You kind of think of this as like Airbnb for camping is what they're wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| Yeah, I have a question, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| Is that their permanent residence, the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| It is, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4578)|
| 1:16:25| There's no guarantee that the applicant would have to, you know, the applicant wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| have to always live on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| Let's see, I had a, I can't remember if I put a condition in there about them having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4593)|
| 1:16:43| I don't think I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| They could either, the resident, the owner could live in the site or they could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| like a camp manager live in the house or that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| That's the only people that can live a year long on the property is basically the camp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| or the manager of the property or the forest ranger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| I can't remember how it was worded in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| But there's no condition that requires someone to be on site at all times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4624)|
| 1:17:11| There's not a condition that there has to be a manager on site at all times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4631)|
| 1:17:18| The, let me look at the principle use standards real quick and see how that's worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4638)|
| 1:17:33| It doesn't, the campground section of the city code doesn't have any kind of requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| associated with the owner having to live on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| It just allows for management headquarters to be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4663)|
| 1:17:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| Has this been approved before, something like this within the city since recode happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4673)|
| 1:18:02| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| I know there's going to be another one coming forward sometime this fall or in the winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4684)|
| 1:18:16| For what it's worth, I've seen several of these north of the border, so north of the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4696)|
| 1:18:24| along in Montreal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| They're very popular sorts of places where people can go and stay, still being outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| than to tour around the urban area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| I would say access from a staff standpoint was something we were really concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| having to come through a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| Being that there's only three campsites, they can't do any more than that at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| unless they requested and got it approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| We felt that the amount of traffic being generated just by three campsites really wouldn't be that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| According to their plan of operations, their operating plan, they are going to require a two-night minimum stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4738)|
| 1:19:05| There will be a maximum ten-night stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| There's only three campsites, and each campsite can only have one vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4747)|
| 1:19:14| You never know how many times a camper is going to leave, come and go during their stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| Hopefully not too much, but it's really not going to add a lot of additional traffic to a neighborhood street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4760)|
| 1:19:26| That's the one major concern that we had coming to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| If they start asking for a few more campsites, that might be more of a concern in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4771)|
| 1:19:40| They wouldn't be able to have a fire camp at the campground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| What about noise and music if they're playing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| The campground standards don't have anything different than what the city's ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4789)|
| 1:19:55| codes would already have for fires and for noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4795)|
| 1:20:01| These aren't going to be electrified campgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4801)|
| 1:20:08| If there was noise, it shouldn't be amplified unless it's a battery-powered amplification of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4808)|
| 1:20:16| Hopefully that's not going to be a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4816)|
| 1:20:21| I could definitely never really know until people are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4821)|
| 1:20:37| I don't have anything else to say about this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| Are we wrapping up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| We're at the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| Do you want to add something to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| I just wanted to say for case 30, I didn't say anything earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| but I do intend to recuse myself from that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| Just FYI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4853)|

| 1:20:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| I guess that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210907-agenda-review?start=4861)|
