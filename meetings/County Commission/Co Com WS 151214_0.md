| 0:00:34| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=34)|
| 0:00:35| Ten members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=35)|
| 0:00:40| Commissioner McKenzie, could I call on you, please, to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=40)|
| 0:00:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=44)|
| 0:00:45| Let us please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=45)|
| 0:00:46| Gentlemen, remove your caps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=46)|
| 0:00:47| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=47)|
| 0:00:58| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=58)|
| 0:01:19| We've got a kabillion items to come before us tonight, so we'll sort of get ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=79)|
| 0:01:23| on an easy start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=83)|
| 0:01:25| I'd like to make a couple of announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=85)|
| 0:01:30| One of the things that the Board of Education has implemented over the last few years is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| what I'll refer to as School of Tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=94)|
| 0:01:38| Now I need to be technical in saying that that's the Paul Kelly Volunteer Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=98)|
| 0:01:44| They have a graduating class tomorrow evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=104)|
| 0:01:48| That graduating class consists of those students that had to apply themselves, had to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=108)|
| 0:01:58| it through an interview process, and then work through obtaining a high school diploma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=118)|
| 0:02:08| And I applaud them for that, and I applaud Knox County for having the program in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=128)|
| 0:02:14| that allows a kid that may just have a credit or two lacking a high school education to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=134)|
| 0:02:24| complete their high school education and get a diploma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| That graduation ceremony is tomorrow evening, 7 o'clock at Central High School, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=147)|
| 0:02:36| Also I need to make another announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| The Audit Committee meets this Thursday, 9 to 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| And I say 9 to 11 because we need to work within a two-hour window there, if we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| for the Audit Committee, because there is then a Tennessee State Delegation meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=168)|
| 0:02:56| of the delegates that represent Knox County and Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=176)|
| 0:03:01| That meeting will be Thursday at 11.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| If you need more information on that, please contact me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| Now then, as a result of that, we need to add tonight to our items a discussion item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| to make sure that we know what couple of items we want to be sure and discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=196)|
| 0:03:24| McKenzie, Commissioner McKenzie has probably, does your resolution fit into that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=204)|
| 0:03:32| It should, so I don't know if you want to do that at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| We will do that at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| We will not have a discussion item at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| Which item number is that, Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| Resolution 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| 38 I had on the list of those items which should be pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| Commissioner Smith, you comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| Yeah, Commissioner McKenzie, the items you all came up with was the Joint Committee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| I thought we were going to come up with a couple separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| There are two items that I think that Representative Smith has sort of as an agenda, two items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=244)|
| 0:04:12| from the Board of Education and we, County Commission, need to come up with our couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| And that will fit within the resolution discussion of Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=260)|
| 0:04:29| So much for my list of items that we then need to discuss, excuse me, my items that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=269)|
| 0:04:39| are in the line of announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| We're now going to discuss the agenda, no, we're going to approve the minutes of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| I hear a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| The motion is properly before us to approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| Do we not need to announce the delay on that one discussion item right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| We're now going to discuss the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| Okay, well I thought that would come under amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| We are now going to discuss the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| And as I see it, there is only one item that's added, that's item 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| Are there other additions to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| If not, we will then move to something that I'll term it as not on consent, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=327)|
| 0:05:35| items that we will discuss this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| And the items that will be discussed will be item 7, 12, 13, 14, 21, 31, 35, 36, 37,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=338)|
| 0:06:06| 38, and 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=366)|
| 0:06:17| Are there other items that commissioners would like to see pulled for discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=377)|
| 0:06:27| Not necessarily pulled, but are we going to discuss any of these presentation discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| items or all of those next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| Items 43, 44, and 45 are next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=399)|
| 0:06:49| I would like to discuss a little bit about the action on, is it number 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| Was that pulled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| 12 was pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| Commissioner, oh, I'm sorry, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| Commissioner Bussler, continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| Oh, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| I think that's the only one I was asking about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| I don't want to pull this, but I just think that it's good to know this one is on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| county access control and driveway design policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| Now the private driveways come under the same rules, which give us a lot more control over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| traffic patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| So thank you, engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| Any other items on tonight's agenda that need to be discussed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=451)|
| 0:07:38| One other item, item number 36, I'm sorry, will be pulled to read because 36 has a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=458)|
| 0:07:46| caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| I want the new caption read tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| It was my understanding 22 was going to be pulled, but is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=473)|
| 0:08:08| Do you wish to discuss item 22?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| I thought that was going to be pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| Let me see if...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| No, 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| The sheriff's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Who are you looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| The sheriff isn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| No, Trammell's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| Is Lee here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| Yeah, he's back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Where's Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| Lee Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| Hey, are we pulling 22?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=506)|
| 0:08:37| Mr. Trammell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| You may want to describe what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| He knows what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| It's what we discussed this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| You're going to leave it on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| Ms. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Item 31 will need to go without recommendation because you just got that contract today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=539)|
| 0:09:07| Item 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| So it needs to be pulled for consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| If it is pulled from consent, it will be no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| Any other considerations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| Yes, the postponement of discussion item number 45 regarding the safety center due to a conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=556)|
| 0:09:34| of another meeting will be postponed until next Monday at a regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=574)|
| 0:09:41| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| 43, 44, and 45 will be discussed next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=582)|
| 0:09:50| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| Number 13, I just have two simple questions to ask on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| 13 will be pulled and you will be able to discuss them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=596)|
| 0:10:03| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| At the appropriate time, I'd like to make an added discussion item for Monday's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=606)|
| 0:10:14| This is a discussion item for next Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| And the item is the electronic voting procedure and procurement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=617)|
| 0:10:24| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| Mr. Chairman, could we move 21 up to the front of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=627)|
| 0:10:35| I've got Captain Wilshire here who can speak on item number 21 and maybe put some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| to bed on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| I look to my fellow commissioners, item 21 is the item with the most attention this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=644)|
| 0:10:51| Would it be okay to move item 21 to the front of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| There being no objection, that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| Commissioner, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| Thanks, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| The one that Commissioner Brown was talking about, about the driveway, does the deck get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| pulled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| I just wanted to make sure I was trying to keep my orders straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| Bring that to everybody's attention that now we have better control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=677)|
| 0:11:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| Do I have a motion that the consent items be put on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=685)|
| 0:11:33| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| Motion's probably before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| Make a motion that everything that needs to be added gets added and everything that needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| to be deferred, deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| I don't know if that's needed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| We did have one that was added in its caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| Second. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed, no. Motion carries. With the request that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=721)|
| 0:12:18| we take item 21 first, Madam Clerk, please read. Consideration of a resolution of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| Commission of Knox County, Tennessee approving a contract with Sirius Technologies Inc. for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| the provision of an inmate communication and management system, resolution 301. Motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| to approve. Second. There are several people signed up to speak to this. Would someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=753)|
| 0:12:50| from either Purchasing or the Sheriff's Department like to speak first? Sir, name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=770)|
| 0:13:02| for the record. Sir, Lee Trammell, 400 Main Avenue, Chief of the Knox County Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| Office. I've got Chief Rodney Bivens and Captain Terry Wilshire here that can speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| to this, and I think it will answer a lot of questions that may arise out of this. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=790)|
| 0:13:16| an excellent contract we've negotiated. It's a good deal for Knox County, and if I could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| I'll bring those guys down here that can speak to the nuts and bolts of the contract to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| you how it's going to be better for the inmates and for the taxpayers. Name and address for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=807)|
| 0:13:49| the record, please, sir. Captain Terry Wilshire, Knox County Sheriff's Office, 5001 Maloneyville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| Road, Knoxville. And your comments, please. Just on top of what the Chief is saying here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| we've worked for quite a few months negotiating a wonderful contract for the taxpayers of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| Knox County. Some of the benefits we are finding for this are going to be taxpayer savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| of money, better safety and security for our facilities, a lot better services for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| folks that unfortunately have loved ones that are in our correctional facilities and need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| to communicate with them, a lot better rates for them not having to pay as much, a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| better services. We're going to a lot of stuff like video visitation, which we're allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| the inmates to receive somewhat unlimited calls right now from video on this new contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| where they can pay very small amounts of money and even do it from home. We think this impedes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| on the impact on the children having to come to a facility and witness jail behaviors and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=880)|
| 0:14:47| activities and things like that. We've already seen the proof in the pudding, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| We've seen videos where children are getting to sit on laps of mothers and dads and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| their loved ones in jail in a lot better environment being their own home. So that's one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=895)|
| 0:15:01| things that really motivates us about this sort of a union. The contract that we negotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| is actually one where we did an all-in-one, so where we save lots of money by not having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| to buy new services. The company that we're negotiating with is actually providing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| all these services, most of the time free for the taxpayers in Knox County, no cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| out of our pocket whatsoever to provide these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=920)|
| 0:15:31| One of the things the Chief was talking about the rates and everything, of course there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| was some national coverage coming out about rates. Lots of the rates for inmate phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| calls were negotiated over the years. FCC actually did some things in government that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| made these rates go down. The rates are going to be going down anyway for inmate phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| to a really small rate of like 11 cents a minute on those. But one of the things we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| did with this contract for video visitation, which a lot of people are just now starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| to learn we've done with it, was like a $5.99 call to do it from home. We negotiated downwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| 19 cents a minute. So if they want to visit any time they'd like to for the inmates, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=962)|
| 0:16:08| we actually made it even more convenient for the inmates. In fact, they actually have tablets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| now that we can give them. They can go to sales, their own sale, and a little more privacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| in their own sale and get these calls. So for 19 cents a minute, as many times as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| want to do it, we're feeling we're giving a lot more contact for the loved ones on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| outside. More opportunity for them to have contact with their loved ones, see their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| That was one of our biggest goals in this contract, was to make it easier on them and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| make more benefit for that. Because we know from correctional experience the more impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| they have on their families, the more contact they have with their families, the better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| off we are in jails. Less violence, less problems with inmates, less disciplinary problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| So we know for a fact that that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| And, I'm sorry, can I continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| No, go ahead. Continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| Sorry, I've got some time left there. Another benefit we have of this is emails. One of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| the things we can do for emails, we're doing emails at 35 cents, which is less than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| cost of a stamp. And we're seeing that dramatically climb. That's one of the things the inmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| can do now is do emails back and forth with their loved ones, parents, kids, mom, dad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| husband, wife, and they're doing those at a miraculous rate. It's an easier way for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| them to do it. They get almost instant feedback. They only have to wait for it to be mailed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| out and wait for response and writing to come back. And they really like that. And so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| negotiated that. A really good contract for having the emails available for the inmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| Commissioner Broyles, do you have a question of this speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| Yeah, I do. Thanks. Hi. Thanks for being here to answer these questions. So right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1054)|
| 0:17:41| the rates are for the video chat is 19 cents a minute, but you anticipate it dropping down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1061)|
| 0:17:49| to 11 cents a minute eventually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| No, ma'am. The rates are what it is. 11 cents was for phone rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| For phone call rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| For a phone call, it's 11 cents a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| We negotiated down the price for the videos being 19 cents a minute. What we used to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| was $5.99, and that was like for a 30-minute visit. So what we did now to make it easier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| some people don't want to talk for 30 minutes. Some people might just want to do 15. So now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| they can just do it by minute, 19 cents a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| Okay. So let me make sure I've got all this correct. So the rates now for a phone call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| are 11 cents a minute. The rate for a video chat is 19 cents a minute, and emails are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| 35 cents per email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Correct. And those are for emails going out and emails coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Unlimited amount of those I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Okay. And you said that what you all are able to do now is instead of having a communal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| area where people do visits or take their video chats, they're able to use a tablet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| and take it to their cell or where they can have more privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Okay. Okay. And on letters, are they restricted just the postcards now or can they...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1133)|
| 0:19:03| Postcards unless it's legal mail. Legal mail, we allow envelopes and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| Okay. So it's postcards unless it's legal. Okay. I just wanted to make sure I had all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| of this down correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| Yeah. Our purpose behind that is contraband. Contraband is a huge deal in jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| Things come in from outside in all kinds of forms and fashions, and we had a real problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| there for a while with drugs trying to be sent in just literally and behind stamps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| and letter parts. So that's the best way to keep the inmates safe is to keep those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| from coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| And we feel we've found a way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Okay. I think that was... Do you all keep track of... Are you all tracking the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1173)|
| 0:19:44| of communications just in general between inmates and family and friends, people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| they're communicating with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Outside. So you're able to track that and see that those numbers are going up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Can you provide us with some of that so that we can see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| For which portion? Do you want the video visitation or do you want the email part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| Actually, I'd like to see both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| For emails, just to give you an example, when we started the project last year, we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| around 15,000 a month. Now we're up to about 43,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| So it grows anywhere from 2,000 to 2,500 per month right now, per email. Video visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1215)|
| 0:20:22| that's... We're doing close to, I'd say... So we do them also in two locations. Make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| sure you understand. They don't always have to pay for these video visits either. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| kiosks set up in a mobile location where they can actually kind of do it for free. It doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| cost me anything. We have nine of those set up and they can either go online and set those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| up or call us and we'll set it up for the folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| Okay. How does that work? Can you explain that to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| Sure. It's a... Instead of doing remote visits, it's a home user on PC. So we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| some people don't like to use computers at home. They don't have computers. So we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| it set up where they can call us and we'll set up a date and time and they can come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| our remote center, which is just close to about a quarter mile away from us. And they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| go to that center and they visit for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Same kind of thing. We just have kiosks set up, a place for them to sit and talk and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| come and use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| So video chats from the remote center are free?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| And I don't have the exact numbers per day, but I think it's around 100 a day, a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| over 100 a day probably. I can get that for you, but I don't have the exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| So if they do it from home, it's the 19 minutes, but from the remote center, it's free for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| the family and for the inmate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| Yes. No, the inmate doesn't cost anything. It's just that one cost is what the family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| pays to call in. And on top of the schedule, we do two scheduled visits a week to explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| to you a little bit more. They do two scheduled 30-minute visits. They get those. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| those. The officers know right at the first of the day when they come into their pod to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| see if the inmates are the ones that have the visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| Now on top of that, what we have available also is called video calls. And with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| the people outside, they can actually set up a call at any time of day, as long as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| inmate has a tablet or it can be in front of the kiosk, and they can actually have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| 30-minute visit any time they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| Okay. And how many tablets do you all have available for use among the inmates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| Right now, we have close to 300 available right now. We just got the install in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| more. So we were doing as a kind of a test to first see how successful they would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| Proved to be very successful, so we're adding more and more as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Which is a great thing about this contract. You know, they have an unlimited amount for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| us. So no matter how big we grow, how much the project grows, we can build at them for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| us at no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Okay. So the company that the contract is with is providing those to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Okay. So, all right. If you could put the numbers into an e-mail and send to us, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| would be really helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Okay. Great. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| I can do that. No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Commissioner McKenzie, do you have questions for Captain Wilson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| Yeah. Just real quick, and that's so, and another one jumped out at me. In terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| the kiosk locations that the family member can come to, can they use those with the tablet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1371)|
| 0:22:58| or is that a kiosk to kiosk set location at the penal facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1378)|
| 0:23:05| No, sir. They can use tablets along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| And like I said, we're still installing it. I don't have it in every exact pod at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| detention facility on Maloneyville. We have it in every place right now. And we're growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| as we go. Of course, it takes a lot of manufacturing to get them in, but we will have them in every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| location. So if anybody doesn't want to use a kiosk on a wall, they can check out one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| of these tablets and use it. Much more convenient for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| Right. And my second question, I guess, concern, and it probably exists now, a whole lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| times with emails, you know, if someone joins LinkedIn or this, they'll grab the person's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| inbox and flood it with emails, all the people that they know. Are there any provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| because in that situation, it's spam emails. Do they get, when they log on, do they get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| charged for those incoming spam type emails? Is there a vetting process when they can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| hey, I got these 10 that are... That's a great question. Let me explain to you how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| It works really good. It keeps them doing it. Here's the reason. Because it's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| traditional email system, so therefore, if I send you, Commissioner, send you an email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| and I'm an inmate from jail, if I send you one, first of all, you've got to get a notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| from the company saying you've received a message from an inmate. Okay? At that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| in time, you've got to make a decision if you even want to accept that or even read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| it. If you choose you don't want to read it or you never want to receive one again, you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| got an option to say, don't ever let me see one of these again. If you recognize the name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| of the inmate, you can choose to get it. You'll be directed to a website. The website will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| have you log in, give your credentials, create an account, and upon that time, then you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| choose to read that or not by that way. So it gives you lots of safety net for it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| just sent out. So they can't arbitrarily just send emails. Like you folks, if inmates want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| to try to send you emails, it wouldn't work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| Now, how about coming back in, if someone's trying to send to that particular email address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| They can send it to the inmate, yeah, but if it comes in through any kind of system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| it has to come in through the company system. So you have to log in on the other ways. Let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| say, if you want to respond to me or send me something, you log in, create an account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| at jailatm.com, for example, when we're using. You go there and you set it up. You say, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| pick an inmate from the dropdown. You have an account, so the system already knows who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| you are. So you're not spam right there. It already knows you're not spam because you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| got identifiers. You choose what inmate you want to send one to and you send it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| So it's more of a messaging system than an email. We like to use email as a word because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| everybody understands email better, but it's more of a messaging system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| Any other questions of Captain Wilshire? If not, moving on to other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1525)|
| 0:25:35| He took care of it for me, but Chief Rodney Bivens at the Sheriff's Office, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| Thank you, Chief Bivens. Chief Termal, do you have any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| Commissioners, do you have any other comments of these speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| If not, what we have before us now will be a list of, unless there's other commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| discussion at this time, these will be comments of people that have signed, as I'll refer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| to it, as public forum, but they want to speak on this particular item that is before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| right now, so I will go down the list. Phoned into the Commission Office, First Speaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1568)|
| 0:26:15| Jacob Weinstead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1575)|
| 0:26:29| Sir, I request that you give your name and address for the record and confine your comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| Thank you. My name is Jake Weinstein, and my address is 4627 Martin Mill Pike in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1596)|
| 0:26:45| I'm a member of the Riverside Community Catholic Worker House, and our mission is to tend to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1605)|
| 0:26:53| people, to try to care for people who are marginalized in this culture, so some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1613)|
| 0:27:02| things that we do are feed homeless people. Sometimes homeless people will come to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| home and take showers or do laundry. The other part of what our mission is, is to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| the violence of the system that we live in that creates people being marginalized, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| I have been a nurse in my life, and I've been a teacher, currently working at Pine Gap Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| School, teaching there, and have had lots of exposure to the effects and the evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| of violence that come from our system directed to children and adults. My son has been incarcerated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1648)|
| 0:27:39| in Knox County, and I have had the privilege of being able to visit him in person in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1659)|
| 0:27:46| County, and I know how much it has meant to him to have someone, to have me, be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1666)|
| 0:27:54| visit him in person. He has had a hard road. If we're going to say that people who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1674)|
| 0:28:08| incarcerated are bad people and should not be treated humanely, then maybe it makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1688)|
| 0:28:16| to deprive people who are incarcerated of human contact, face-to-face, direct human| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| contact. I think that, as was spoken by the previous speaker, video visitation offers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1702)|
| 0:28:32| some advantages to people who cannot get to the jail, but it's essential to have in-person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| face-to-face visitation. To me, I'm here speaking today for the community and for myself, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1718)|
| 0:28:45| I believe that having no opportunity for face-to-face visitation is actually another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| example of violence against people. The violence that has created this problem is perpetuated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1731)|
| 0:28:58| by removing the opportunity for face-to-face contact. That's all I have to say. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1738)|
| 0:29:06| Thank you, sir. Crystal Gourley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1746)|
| 0:29:32| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| Yes, my name is Crystal Tamera Gourley, address 235 Carter Road, apartment P1, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| Tennessee, 37914. Okay. Yes, I would like to start by stating that most of the inmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1782)|
| 0:29:57| that are experiencing incarceration issues, that many of them do not have a lot that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1797)|
| 0:30:06| come from in the first place. Low socioeconomic statuses, as I'm sure you've heard of, different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| type of rigorous studies done by the American Sociological Association and the American| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| Psychological Association. It entails that typically recidivism rates do go back up once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1817)|
| 0:30:24| they are not allowed to have in-person visits. Many individuals thrive and they live off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1824)|
| 0:30:31| of those in-person visits. Being subjected to a kiosk, a computer screen, is highly problematic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1831)|
| 0:30:39| for different social issues and different psychological issues. I do believe that the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1839)|
| 0:30:47| for the in-person visit should still stay, because typically that is all that individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| have. In order for someone to meet with a loved one over a kiosk, the loved one would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| to have internet. They would have to have a high-speed plan with typically any company such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1858)|
| 0:31:05| Xfinity, Comcast, Knowledge, U-verse, and et cetera. They would have to be able to afford a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| computer with an infused camera and a microphone. And so it's very difficult for many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1872)|
| 0:31:20| in order to gain access to these resources. And it actually works out less taxing if they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1880)|
| 0:31:28| able to come down and see their loved ones face-to-face. Many individuals are only able to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| with their attorneys, and that's very inhumane treatment. This is actually cruel and unusual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1894)|
| 0:31:42| punishment within itself to keep someone away from someone that they love and that they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| like to visit with and see on a regular basis. And I hope that you take this into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1913)|

| 0:32:30| When I came in the door tonight, I saw a sign on the door that, you know, if you had hearing problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1950)|
| 0:32:37| call this number. And I called and they didn't have a clue about it, but they found somebody that did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| And he brought me something that part of this I could actually hear you guys well, and then it went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| on the blitz. But anyway, kind of came and go. What I've heard about the system they have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1968)|
| 0:32:56| and around the country, people with hearing problems have real issues with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1976)|
| 0:33:05| I know there are places where you have a 15-minute visit, you actually get two minutes of actual time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| on a good day. This really is a problematic system. I'd love to see the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| We've tried to get it so we could see that. But the bottom line is when you cut out personal visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=1997)|
| 0:33:27| when you cut out contact with your loved ones, the recidivism rate goes way up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2007)|
| 0:33:37| The violence rate in the jail goes up because of the frustration of it. It's all about the humanity of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2017)|
| 0:33:49| Can you imagine being in jail for years, and some people are there for years, and not being able to actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2029)|
| 0:33:56| make eye contact with your parents, your son, your daughter? The way it's set up, you're looking up at a camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2036)|
| 0:34:07| They get to see your chin when you're talking to them. And when you're looking at the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| they're looking at your forehead kind of thing. It's not set up well for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| It's supposed to be good for the kids to see you in the cell block with the fight going on behind you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| or somebody coming by and saying, oh, your wife is hot. I'd really like some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| Can you imagine that for years, not contacting your little kids? There's something inhumane about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2069)|
| 0:34:37| And the track record for this company, their average in other places is a dollar a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2077)|
| 0:34:45| I'd like to see this contract that it's going to be cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| But bottom line, if I needed to see my priest and make confession, I'd rather not do it on camera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2089)|
| 0:34:56| with people listening, with it being recorded. That's nobody's business but mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| And my priest, for example, the only contact you can have is with church groups that come in and visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2102)|
| 0:35:09| and do church services there, or with your attorney. That's the only personal contact besides the guards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2109)|
| 0:35:16| And that can have a really bad effect on people. It's been bad, and it's getting worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2116)|
| 0:35:26| I don't have any problems with them having all these things in place for the people that can make use of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2126)|
| 0:35:33| But most of the people who are in the system, who haven't had a good enough lawyer to get them out of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| while they're waiting for trial or whatever, they can afford to have the setup you need to have to do it from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2140)|
| 0:35:47| But if you have to go to the jail, you may have to wait all day and not get a visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2147)|
| 0:35:56| Some of the things they're trying to do, maybe it'll work. I'd like to see that in print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2156)|
| 0:36:03| But apparently it's alphabetical order. If your name's Zimmerman, good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| Wait for an ice storm, and then maybe you can be the only one that makes it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2167)|
| 0:36:16| I really urge you to at least delay a decision on this so that you can get public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| I don't know anybody that's heard about this contract. We kind of stumbled on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| I'm with the Knox County Incarceration Collective, and we're trying to change things out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| because there are a lot of things that need changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| So I beg you to please consider this until you can get some more input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| Let the public see the contract. Let the public have some input on this. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| Commissioner Broyles, do you have a question of this presenter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| Yes. Actually, I just wanted to share some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| Do you have a question of this presenter? She's walking away is the reason I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| No. I was going to explain how to access the contract for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2218)|
| 0:37:05| Yes. To be able to access, anyone from the public can access the contract online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| But it can be difficult to figure out how to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| But you have to go to the commission website, and this is for anyone who's listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2236)|
| 0:37:24| who may be watching this at home or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| But just so that the public knows how to access these documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| you can go to the Knox County Commission website and click on the box that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| what's coming up at the next meeting. It will take you to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| and you can scroll down the agenda and see the different items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| And when you click on that specific agenda item, it brings up all the supporting documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| including any contracts. So it is there available to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| It's just, and we try to make it, our IT department tries to make it as easily as possible to access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2278)|
| 0:38:07| But you do have to know where to look, and you do have to have access to a computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| And, of course, our public library system, all of our public libraries have computers for the public to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2293)|
| 0:38:21| But, of course, then you get into whether or not you have access to transportation to be able to get to the public library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2301)|
| 0:38:29| So I understand all the hurdles that are in the way, and I'm very sympathetic to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| Where I live...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| And I'm so sorry you're having difficulty with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| Where I live, geographically, Internet is not an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| We're in East Tennessee. There's a lot of hills and valleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| And it's just not an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| And I know, for example, where I go to church and do a lot of my activism is in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2332)|
| 0:38:59| This is a class issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| There are a lot of people there with loved ones in prison, and they may not even have a telephone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| If they want to go to the library, it's three miles in either direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| It's a long walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| So this is a class issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| And the people that can afford to do it from the convenience of their home, that may be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| But it's not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| It'll never be the same as a personal visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| Even through the glass, you can make eye contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| You can actually see the person you love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| And it's not the same as poor-quality video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| And this does affect a large number of constituents in my district as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2377)|
| 0:39:43| And I do understand the hurdles that are in place as far as being able to get to a computer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2383)|
| 0:39:53| and being able to know how to work the computer and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| And, yes, if you don't have it at your home, even if you go to the library, it can be real tricky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| Mr. John Mott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2405)|
| 0:40:31| Mr. Mott, give your name and address for the record, and you have five minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| My name is John Mott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| I'm at 4721 Clark Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2438)|
| 0:40:47| I'm not going to repeat some of the things already said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| I really agree with what they said in terms of the humaneness, in terms of recidivism rate is much better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2451)|
| 0:41:00| with in-person contact visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| I would ask you to postpone the vote next week so that more people can look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| A piece that needs to be looked at is the success rate of this company elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2470)|
| 0:41:16| The promises I heard tonight sound really good, but their track record is not that good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2476)|
| 0:41:23| and the company needs to be checked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| Thank you, Mr. Mott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| Mark Brown II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2489)|
| 0:41:49| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| My name is Mark Antoine Brown II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| My address is 5273 Brick Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| I just briefly wanted to talk about and just basically kind of ask you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| have you all considered the psychological ramifications of essentially denying someone social access to their loved ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2520)|
| 0:42:07| Because the ramifications of that are essentially creating more people who are coming back into the jail system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| Because if I have lost my humanity by not being able to see the people that I love and care about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| then what are the chances of me actually being able to survive in this system that I've been put into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| Because I've learned prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| I've learned how to live in prison, and I've had no access to anybody in my family, any of my loved ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| because all I can do is see them through a television screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| So now I end up coming back and being fed back into this same system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| So my question is to ask you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| is there any evidence that shows that this will not create more problems and is helping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| Because the only benefit that it seems that it's making is that it's creating a little back money for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2561)|
| 0:42:48| I mean, that was generally my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| Has there been any research done on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| And that's really all I really want to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| and I believe that this should at the very least be pushed back for further reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| Cammie Morgan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2585)|
| 0:43:16| Cammie Morgan, address 241 Hawthorne Avenue, Apartment A, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2596)|
| 0:43:23| Yeah, I echo what folks have been saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| There are multiple studies that have been done that recidivism rates increase when in-person visitations are banned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2607)|
| 0:43:36| and also studies have been done that one in-person visit from a loved one experiencing incarceration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2616)|
| 0:43:45| can reduce that person's risk of recidivism by 13% for a new quote-unquote crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2625)|
| 0:43:52| and 25% for a technical violation of probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| So in-person visits are incredibly important for someone's humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| They're incredibly important for keeping folks out of this violent system that has been created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2642)|
| 0:44:09| And additionally, I think that video visitations can be a fine thing if they're an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2649)|
| 0:44:16| but they need to be an option among in-person visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| and there's been several studies shown that the Sheriff's Department has claimed that this would be a good safety measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2660)|
| 0:44:29| but there's been several studies shown by prisonpolicy.org| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| that when video visitations are the only access allowed for people to be able to visit with loved ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2673)|
| 0:44:41| that tensions and violence in jails increase because of that lack of humanity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2681)|
| 0:44:47| that people are not allowed access to actually seeing their loved ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2687)|
| 0:44:54| And so I think if this contract is to be approved, it needs to be approved with a stipulation that in-person visits are reinstated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| and that's the only way that this contract can be approved is that in-person visits are reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2700)|
| 0:45:06| And that, again, as some folks were saying earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| that there's been multiple complaints and experiences by people who are hard of hearing or deaf using these systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2709)|
| 0:45:16| that they're not applicable to folks that use sign language because of multiple consistent reports of pixelation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2716)|
| 0:45:24| freezing, time lags, video calls being dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| Especially with Securus, there's been a lot of complaints of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| There's been a lot of complaints of folks not getting their money back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| when there's so much freezing and time lag and pixelation that you can't actually visit with somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| or experiences that people have, and you can find this on prisonpolicy.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| these experiences that people have shared of when someone is visiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| and then by the time that the freeze lag has stopped and they're trying to tell somebody that they can see them again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| it freezes again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| And so how much of that actual 15- or 30-minute visit do they actually get of seeing somebody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2755)|
| 0:46:01| That's a serious problem that needs to be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| and I urge you all to postpone this vote until people can have access to the contract to be able to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2764)|
| 0:46:12| to be able to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Corinne Swagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2777)|
| 0:46:26| My name is Corinne Swagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| I live at 241 Hawthorne Avenue, Apartment A, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2787)|
| 0:46:40| I would like to address specifically some of the comments made by the first speaker that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2800)|
| 0:46:51| according to any reports you will pull up about people's experiences using these kiosks in the video visitation system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2811)|
| 0:47:02| it's completely contradictory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| There is, like what has been said, actually an increase in violence, an increase in tension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2825)|
| 0:47:13| when you are not allowed to sit face-to-face and visibly be able to inspect your loved one who's incarcerated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2833)|
| 0:47:24| and make sure you have your own peace of mind, they're okay, their well-being, they're all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2844)|
| 0:47:32| Not being able to, like, use eye contact, even if it's just through a glass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| and to be able to just, like, talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2857)|
| 0:47:53| Securus is really pretty well-known for having horrible customer service and horrible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2873)|
| 0:48:02| at least with their phone system, it's, like, pretty appalling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| There's actually a website called, like, Securus Pissed Off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| and it's just pages and pages and pages of people's comments about how they weren't refunded when calls were dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2891)|
| 0:48:21| And how their calls were just, like, cut out for no reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2901)|
| 0:48:28| They've been charged all these, like, hidden fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| And it leads me to believe that if they, they're, like, systems that they're offering already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2911)|
| 0:48:40| like phone system, you know, if that can't, people aren't happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2920)|
| 0:48:47| I don't know why, what is going to, like, convince me that their video kiosk systems are going to be any better, like, quality or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| And so I support the Knoxville Incarceration Collective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2934)|
| 0:49:05| and just want to, I support what their demands are in, like, asking to push back this decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2945)|
| 0:49:18| and really think about the implications of signing a contract with Securus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| And to make in-person visits, to reinstate in-person visits and not ban them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2963)|
| 0:49:29| but make video visitations an option if that's an avenue you wanted to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| and you weren't able to physically go to these jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| And I've spoken to people who are hearing impaired who've used the kiosks and were not able to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2978)|
| 0:49:52| Like, to use, like, a phone at the video kiosk is my understanding of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| and they have not been able to even hear what the people they're visiting are saying at the other end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=2998)|
| 0:50:06| And so that's not accessible to a lot of individuals right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3006)|
| 0:50:14| And I just really urge you to push back this decision further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3014)|
| 0:50:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| Michael Mahaffrey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3026)|
| 0:50:43| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| My name is Michael Mahaffrey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| I live on 1100 Lula Powell Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| One thing that I have not heard being brought up so far is I don't think there's any solid evidence to prove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3049)|
| 0:51:00| that stopping in-person visits would stop the influx of drug traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3060)|
| 0:51:07| In fact, if anything, there's probably other avenues through which contraband can be easily supplied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3067)|
| 0:51:17| to people who want that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| And until something more substantial can prove that, I don't think you have a case for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3080)|
| 0:51:31| I would not want you to postpone this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| I would want you to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| Michael Goins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3104)|
| 0:51:53| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| Michael Goins, 2112 Washington Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| And I don't want to repeat that everything's been said, but I think the in-person visits should stay in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3120)|
| 0:52:09| because of the reasons of ‑‑ I know a lot of veterans go in and out of jails and prisons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3129)|
| 0:52:16| and they suffer from PTSD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| And I was just thinking of one person, a veteran, could get an in-person visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| like a lot of people with mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| And we go back to other issues of hearing impaired, glitches in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3148)|
| 0:52:36| There's a whole bunch of things that I could say against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| but I think the county sheriff's office did make points that it did sound like it was an ideal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3158)|
| 0:52:45| that could be thought about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| But I'm totally against taking away in-person visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| because I think if one person just can see one loved one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| I mean, to me, I don't think everyone is actually guilty until proven guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| They're just out mostly at the county jail for holding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| You know, I thought in America we all had a fair chance at our justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3188)|
| 0:53:14| And I can go all the way back, actually, to the civil rights movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| I'm pretty sure Dr. King would want an in-person visit instead of a video visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| You know, they had a lot of issues going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| And it comes in an issue, again, of privacy act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| somewhere I think drawn along the lines of constitutional rights are being taken away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| if you take away the visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| I just listened to a lot of things that I heard about from the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| and it was that they made some good points that keep the video visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3224)|
| 0:53:54| but I think that should be optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| There should be always in-person visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| no matter the cost or how much money that is going to come out to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| that the county would be earning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| I'm pretty sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| I'm not exactly sure of the figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| but just someone having human contact will make them human again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| because these people and other people have to get out of jail one day or out of prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| And I'm not sure about how the prison system works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| but I know in Knox County just to have someone come and see you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| if you've been in there 30 days and you're not been sentenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| you haven't even been to court yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| You're just sitting there 30 days until 23-1 and lockup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| and you still don't get out for your visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| That's just part of it, getting out of the cell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| It makes you feel a lot better to be able to go out and see somebody you haven't seen in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3279)|
| 0:54:46| Maybe it's not good for the children to go out and see their parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| but older children, 13, 14, or 15, maybe haven't seen mom or dad for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| they might want to go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| I mean, it might be hard for them to actually look at their parents behind a glass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| but I think that just the human side of making sure that the visits stay in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3302)|
| 0:55:10| I'm asking the county commission to consider it, to keep the visits in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3310)|
| 0:55:17| and not to take them out with this new contract, and that's all I have for this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3325)|
| 0:55:35| My name is David Hayes, and I live at 241 Hawthorne Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| I'm a member of a group called Knoxvillians Against Injustice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| also a member of Black Lives Matter Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| and I stand here in solidarity with Knoxville Incarceration Collective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| and not only the incarceration collective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| but I stand in solidarity with a lot of our family members in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| a lot of our community members, a lot of our friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| a lot of people who you would call your constituents who are faced with facing time in jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| in Knox County Jail, and I challenge you all to recognize the humanity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| and not just myself, obviously, in every occurring thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| a theme among the people coming up here is recognizing the humanity of people we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| These aren't just vague characters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| Like I said, family members, friends, community members, constituents, and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| And so when you recognize the humanity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| you don't take away a person's right to see another person's face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| another person they love, their face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| just for the sake of private and public dollars and revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| That makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| We should be putting the priority in keeping the humanity of these individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3395)|
| 0:56:42| because when these individuals come out of prison, come out of jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| you don't want them coming back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| And taking away a person's right to even see another face is just contributing to the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| and contributing to the cycles that so many of our communities are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| And I also stand to ask that you all postpone the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| to give more people a chance to actually know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| But if the vote does happen, I challenge you all to recognize the humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| If you recognize the humanity of people, you will not sign this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| Anyone else in the audience that has spoken to me about speaking at public forum on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| We properly have before us a motion to approve, properly made, and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| Yes, I do want to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| We have a couple more questions for the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3451)|
| 0:57:56| There's two different issues that are being discussed that are interrelated, but they are separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3476)|
| 0:58:05| One of the questions that I have is when did the ban on personal visits actually go into effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3485)|
| 0:58:15| It's a little over a year ago, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| Over a year ago we've been doing video visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Could you give me the exact date on that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| I mean, you don't have to pull it off the top of your head right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| but just when you get back to your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| Yeah, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| So that's not something that's going to happen if this contract is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3509)|
| 0:58:37| It's not going to create this ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| This ban is actually already in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| It's been in effect for at least a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| One of the questions I have is does this contract preclude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| is there any clause in it anywhere that would preclude reinstating personal visits if that policy changes in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3532)|
| 0:59:01| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| There is no concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| Because I know that there are some contracts with companies who offer these services that it's in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3546)|
| 0:59:16| and it actually states in the contract that there will not be personal visits allowed at that facility as long as that contract is in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3556)|
| 0:59:23| and I wanted to make sure that that clause was not part of the contract that's being presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| And there is a cost to families for phone calls and for the video chats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3570)|
| 0:59:40| but there is no cost to families for a personal, or there was no cost to families for a personal visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| There's also no cost if you want to still drive out to the detention facility and use the free kiosk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| There is no cost at that point in time other than the cost it costs you to drive out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| At that point, driving to the detention facility for an in-person visit was free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| Driving to the remote center to use the kiosk is also free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| So you're only being charged if you're using your personal equipment outside of the facilities provided by the Knox County Detention Facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3607)|
| 1:00:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| Can you tell me, and you may not have these numbers off the top of your head either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| can you tell me how much the inmate population has increased since 2008, 2010?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3625)|
| 1:00:33| Probably 35%, 40% since 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| I mean, if this really was a recidivism problem, we'd be seeing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3636)|
| 1:00:42| You know, our numbers have been climbing long before we stopped the contact visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| I'm not, this isn't, the question I've got isn't related to recidivism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| I'm just, I'm trying to get a, I'm looking for something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| We're hosting about 1,300 inmates a day right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| I can get that for you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| And because what I would like to know is how much the inmate population has increased over the past decade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3660)|
| 1:01:07| and compare that to the number of correctional officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3667)|
| 1:01:13| and whether or not that has increased to keep pace with the increase in the inmate population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| My guess is that it has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| You know, Judge, we've done a bunch of the last two pods we did with no correctional officers added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| You know, we haven't had any new correctional officers added since 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| We're doing everything we can to run this more efficient, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| This does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| To do these contact visits, you're talking about adding a minimum of 12 more employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| to be able to pull inmates, take them to visitation, take them back to their cell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| I mean, this is, you know, it's cutting edge, and it's very efficient use of taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3703)|
| 1:01:50| You know, our budget on that detention facility is over $30 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| $30 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| So we're looking every day at ways to save taxpayer money, run it more efficient and safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| I understand that it's more efficient and that it's saving money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| and it's also, you know, making the county a little money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3730)|
| 1:02:16| But I understand that people don't like to spend money on corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| And I understand what's involved in pulling someone out for a personal visit versus handing them a tablet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3741)|
| 1:02:27| But I do share a lot of the same concerns about the ban on personal visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3747)|
| 1:02:33| I like that the video system is available as an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3753)|
| 1:02:39| but I think that we need to have further discussion on what it would take to be able to reinstate personal visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3759)|
| 1:02:49| Do we need to increase the number of correctional officers in order to make that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3769)|
| 1:02:58| I mean, I think all of us have probably used FaceTime on our iPads or done video chats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| How many of us have actually visited someone in jail or at the detention facility among us sitting up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3784)|
| 1:03:14| I mean, I know I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| And there is, and I've used FaceTime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| We use FaceTime all the time between the grandkids and the grandparents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| And just like is used for any of our military personnel who are serving overseas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| that they're able to video chat with family and friends back home, and that's very valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| And I do like that the number of contacts is increasing for some inmates, and I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3816)|
| 1:03:46| I think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| But there is, I agree, there is a tremendous difference between doing FaceTime, video chat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3827)|
| 1:03:54| and actually sitting down in the same room, even if there's a glass wall between you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| and actually having that face-to-face contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| And I am interested in looking at the research that's out there by the American Psychological Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3843)|
| 1:04:12| and other groups about the long-term impact of banning personal visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| And I understand that this is a monetary issue, and this is a conversation that I think we need to have going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3858)|
| 1:04:29| is what are the benefits of reinstating personal visits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| What are the costs of reinstating personal visits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| And is that something that we can feasibly do moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| Because my feeling is that the biggest reason that we're not doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| is simply that our detention facilities are understaffed, and that's a budget problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3888)|
| 1:04:57| This administration has done everything in its power to ease those burdens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| I mentioned the double bunking of the pods out there without adding any new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| And we do things at the detention facility every day with our inmate programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| We have intensive treatment out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| We have faith-based treatment out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| In the short while, we're going to be discussing a safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| We do everything we can, and we're compassionate to human beings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3923)|
| 1:05:29| We do everything we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| We don't want them to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| We don't want these people returning again and again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| And we know that some of our things that we're doing out there, we're successful at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| We know there's people out there that don't need to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| They're sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| But we don't have a choice right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| That's the cards we're dealt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| And we look forward to the conversation of the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| That's going to come up when we talk about the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| This all kind of dovetails together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| And for the bad guys, the ones that do need to be there, you know, not the mentally ill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| not the ones that are sick, but the ones that do need to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| if they want to see their families face-to-face, don't go to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| You know, we don't want them there anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| Well, that's easy to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| But the fact is they are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| When they get out, we don't want them to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| And that's why I think it's important that we look at this research that's been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| about how face-to-face personal visits can help prevent recidivism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| and can help prevent people from returning to incarceration after they're released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=3997)|
| 1:06:44| But I think at the bottom, this is more an issue of our correctional facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4004)|
| 1:06:52| are just simply not staffed at a high enough level to be able to do personal face-to-face visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4012)|
| 1:07:01| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| So I think that's where we need to look at making changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| so that we can look at a policy change where we bring back personal visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4027)|
| 1:07:13| So I think this is a budgetary issue that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| We'll be happy to have that conversation with you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| And I would support that, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| And I wanted to look a little deeper into the contract over the next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| I'm going to be voting against it simply as a way of making a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4049)|
| 1:07:36| that I believe in the value of personal face-to-face visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| and I want this conversation to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| As you all know, I've always wanted what is best for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4064)|
| 1:07:52| and that includes for all of our citizens, whether they are free and responsible taxpaying citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4072)|
| 1:08:00| whether they are a homeless population, whether they are mentally ill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| or whether they have indeed committed a crime and are behind bars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| We up here represent all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| I think you know that this administration has been very, very good at trying to take care of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| We've been working hard on the safety center for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| Four or five years we've been talking about this, and it's time to move on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| That will help a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| I agree. I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| That will help drop the number of inmates, which will help with that imbalance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| between the inmate population and correctional officer numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4109)|
| 1:08:36| And even if this does pass, you vote against it, believe me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| we'll still have those conversations with you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| We'll be open for that dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| And I just want to make it clear that I'm going to be taking another look at the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| but I do agree that based on the numbers, this is a better contract than the one we had previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4128)|
| 1:08:55| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| And I'm glad to know that the contract does not preclude reinstating personal visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| if the policy is changed in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| and my vote against it will purely be symbolic in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| as a statement that I want this conversation to continue, and I look forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| Thank you. We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| Commissioner Oyenbee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| A couple of things were mentioned about, and you all may not know this right off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| about how not having these visits has increased or could increase violence or people being upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4166)|
| 1:09:36| Have you all seen that in the last year, or have inmates been upset about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4176)|
| 1:09:43| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| We've actually seen at the detention facility with the kiosk and the availability of the visits, that decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4184)|
| 1:09:52| They're busy, they're doing something, it gives them something to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| in their time that they're having, free time or whatever, and they can actually do it inside their cells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4195)|
| 1:10:01| So it's actually taken away from a lot of the combat and that type of stuff that they do inside the jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4201)|
| 1:10:09| because they're busy doing something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| Now, the face-to-face, those were only certain days of the week and certain times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4211)|
| 1:10:20| Is that the way it used to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| When the detention facility was built, to give you a little bit of history on it so that you guys know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4223)|
| 1:10:29| the detention facility was built with the pods that had 48 inmates in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| We double-bunked those, so that went up to like 72 inmates per housing unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| There's four visitation booths per housing unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| So each 72-bed unit has four visitation booths upstairs at the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4243)|
| 1:10:50| And the number of visits would outnumber what we had available on any given day of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4250)|
| 1:10:56| And normally we were able to only provide one day a week visitation for each housing unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4256)|
| 1:11:02| in order to get everybody through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| And with our lobby, most of you guys have toured our lobby, you know how small that area is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4264)|
| 1:11:10| This visit, the way we're doing it now, what we feel like is a very important part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| is that you can visit any given day of the week and you can do that from home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| you can do that at the detention facility for the gas price you pay now to drive out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| But off time as far as when there's video, like they can't call it 2 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4284)|
| 1:11:29| Correct. There is lights out time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| This is a question for people who maybe have members of their family that are technology challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4302)|
| 1:11:50| If someone comes out to the detention center and goes to the kiosk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| is that equivalent visitation as they're getting now if they go out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4315)|
| 1:12:02| There's no change. It's still the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| The free kiosk is the same thing we're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| So it's the same system and there is a staff member that assists them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| that type of stuff in that area where that's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| Mr. Chairman, I don't think Commissioner Broyles can add anything more tonight that's germane to this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| Besides the fact you cannot talk the second time until everybody has been heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| and Commissioner McKenzie has his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| I just had one more question to ask, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| and I was asking for the numbers on population increase and all of those numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4361)|
| 1:12:49| and if you could also get, if we could see actual numbers on the number of fights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| and incidents in the past year, like how many per hundred inmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4375)|
| 1:13:03| Do you all track that each year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| And if you track those numbers, could we take a look at those as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| I just want to see as much information as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| We'll see what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| I would love for us to start actually following the rules as far as how we're speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| To be quite honest, Commissioner Brown is one of the most guilty people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| so I do take offense at this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4405)|
| 1:13:30| I would love for us to have a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| We don't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| Question on, and it's more a statement on the other side of the Internet equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4414)|
| 1:13:45| On the county side, on the Maloneyville Road and the other facilities, we're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4425)|
| 1:13:54| One of my concerns is that cell phone, because most people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| that's how they're communicating is with the cell phone, as the lady talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4438)|
| 1:14:04| We probably have coverage, but if it's anything like my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| as I was out there raking the leaves yesterday, this spot's great and that spot not so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| So, you know, in terms of the meter may be running during that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4452)|
| 1:14:19| and the communication may not be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| So that concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| I just want to, and if it's the only way, you know, if I don't have a vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| can't get to the place, or, you know, if that's my primary way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| I won't say only way, because if you're talking face-to-face, you can get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| So that's my concern with the chat portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| And my general, just a general statement, there's nothing like laying eyes on someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4483)|
| 1:14:53| You know, as I have children that have gone away in the military, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4493)|
| 1:14:59| cross seas, in college, across places, there's nothing like that at some time or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| laying eyeball to eyeball with them and, you know, be it glass or not, just seeing are you okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| And that's hard to do with the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| So those are my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| And, again, that's not really germane to this resolution that we're considering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| because we don't have that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| But I'm very interested in us trying to reestablish some type of, it doesn't have to be weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4525)|
| 1:15:32| It could be biweekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| It could be monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| But at some point, I think, you know, we're all people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| And as much for the person on the outside as for the person on the inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4539)|
| 1:15:45| it's just kind of good to see how folks are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| So that's kind of my concerns and reservations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| And I was actually going to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| But what I want to do is continue this conversation next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| I'll encourage the folks that spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| They kind of understand the parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| I mean, the fact that it hadn't been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| So if you continue to do your due diligence and research, and we will here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4563)|
| 1:16:09| And let's continue this dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| Seeing no further lights, what we have before us, a proper motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4574)|
| 1:16:23| Moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| And we will have a roll call vote beginning in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4592)|

| 1:17:32| Now, while we rewind the paperwork here and move back to item number seven, I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4652)|
| 1:17:38| to take a moment to recognize that the Honorable Mayor Tim Burchett has been here with us at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4658)|
| 1:17:45| this meeting and also that the trustee, Ed Schaus, has been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4665)|
| 1:17:52| It may be more important that I recognize fellow elected officers of the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4672)|
| 1:18:00| Gloria Deathridge, Tracy Sanger, Patty Bounds, and Amber Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4680)|

| 1:18:10| She moves around too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| I appreciate you all being here for this meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| Madam Clerk, item seven, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| On page two, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4701)|
| 1:18:27| reappointing commissioners to serve on the Arena Youth Committee Resolution 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| Are there names to be added to the blank spaces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| I move that this item be passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| Motion before us, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| Properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4728)|
| 1:18:49| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4732)|
| 1:18:55| Item number 12 on page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4735)|
| 1:19:03| This is a resolution approving a contract of employment between the Knox County Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4743)|
| 1:19:11| and Dr. James McIntyre, Jr., whereby Dr. McIntyre is employed as superintendent of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4751)|
| 1:19:18| This is resolution 202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| I guess point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| If we are voting to pass this, are we voting to pass what's written here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4766)|
| 1:19:33| or are we voting to pass the feature that the law director added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4773)|
| 1:19:42| You know, here it's saying that we're voting on a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| So if we pass this, are we voting on what is in our package, or are we voting on a contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4788)|
| 1:19:57| We would be voting on what has come to us by the duly elected Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4797)|
| 1:20:05| By the duly elected Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| But what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| Whatever they sent us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| What did they send us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| Is that your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| So, yes, what did the Board of Education send us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| That's another great one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| The contract extension of Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4825)|
| 1:20:32| Which the law director says is not in proper form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| So we don't have a ‑‑ okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| So as written, I guess as a question, this did not necessarily ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4839)|
| 1:20:50| I'll move that we pass without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| I do think we need to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| That does not preclude discussion tonight, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| And my light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| As the maker of the motion, you wish to speak, Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4864)|
| 1:21:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| Back to the same question, and I guess I will look to the ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4872)|
| 1:21:19| I'm needing to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| There was a vote by the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| Those nine members voted 5‑4 to extend the contract with those parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4885)|
| 1:21:31| And I saw it on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| They went it over with painstaking details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| So that contract was vetted, whether you agree with the vote or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| It was vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4899)|
| 1:21:40| And a vote was had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| So I agree with what you said, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4902)|
| 1:21:48| The Board of Education sent us something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| I don't think they sent this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| I think this contract came post Board of Education with edits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| And they actually had edits that they went through and resolved at the school board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| And now there are additional edits, one significant one, which says it's not legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| Now, that's subsequent to the Board of Education's actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| So I guess my original question is what are we going to be approving on Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| Are we going to approve this document that's basically nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| It says it's not legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| I don't know what the basis of it is, and we can get involved in that a little later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| And I don't even know who to ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| I think the board chair, he's not here today, signed this on a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4956)|
| 1:22:49| December 2 looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| So I think he thought that action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| I don't want to speak for him, but I think he thought he was doing the will of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| So if there's something that can make it invalid later on, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| But as written, I don't want to approve this and we're going to end up in a daggum lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4985)|
| 1:23:11| because there's some huge amount of ambiguity that's been done subsequent to the board vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4991)|
| 1:23:19| The board's will has been, there was a vote, the gavel went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| Now, if there's something that makes it invalid, if we're waiting on something, that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| But to me, they voted yes, and now this says no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5009)|
| 1:23:36| So I don't even know what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| Okay, let's back up for just a second to the board of education meeting passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| They had before them a document prepared to extend the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5024)|
| 1:23:53| They had a second document prepared by the Knox County Law Department that was to be in proper form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5033)|
| 1:24:01| And I believe my observations of the meeting were that some things were incorporated into the original contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5041)|
| 1:24:10| that the board of education then voted on, and that's what they've sent us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5050)|
| 1:24:16| And subsequent to that, there's been a reading by the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| which would say that there are portions of it that are not in due form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5061)|
| 1:24:29| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| Excuse me, I'm sorry, just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| Commissioner McKenzie, or, yes, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| Commissioner Anders had his light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| Yeah, I guess going back to that point of the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| you know, normally when something comes in on consent from the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| is it normal practice, Mr. Law Director, that it's already passed legal muster when we get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5091)|
| 1:25:00| In legal form, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| Well, where we find ourselves, and there's some history to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| the contract you have before you is not an amended contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| This contract is the contract that was passed by the board of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| and presented over here to this committee by the consent agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5115)|
| 1:25:22| whereby it's a contract that comes before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| Currently, we have an offer extended from the board of education to Dr. McIntyre to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5126)|
| 1:25:33| It is a legal offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| The note added to this contract, once this contract came over for resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5136)|
| 1:25:44| it had to be evaluated according to legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| The board, prior to that, we had discussions during its formation about legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5148)|
| 1:25:56| The concerns that we have, and there are several,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| but the major concern here is that when we sign off for you to say this is in legal form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| and has legal correctness, it is absolute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| One of the motions made concerning this contract had to do with the extension of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5168)|
| 1:26:15| and I think the term was, unless found by the attorney general, to be unlawful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5175)|
| 1:26:23| Well, that in itself creates a legal ambiguity that I can't say as it is written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5183)|
| 1:26:29| is it extended or is it not extended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| But that's the contract that the board passed and is before you all for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5192)|
| 1:26:39| The thing not in legal form does not negate the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5199)|
| 1:26:46| It says that there are components of the contract that may not be enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| Well, number two of the contract within itself says it may not be enforceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5211)|
| 1:26:58| because they're asking an attorney general opinion regarding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| So I'm not in a position to say that it's all enforceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| until we know for sure that it's enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| So I cannot sign off on this and say that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| This is not a position that the contract itself is illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| That's not what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| It means that there are potentially elements within the contract that may not be enforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5238)|
| 1:27:25| and this just puts everybody on notice that there are concerns about the contract that may not be enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5245)|
| 1:27:32| But it is no less a legal offer from the Board of Education to Dr. McIntyre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5252)|
| 1:27:38| whereby he can accept or not accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| So what are we, I guess, have you made requests to the attorney general's office to clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| I know that the request has been made, but the county cannot make a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| But we have asked the state to make the request as it relates to the statute says renewal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5271)|
| 1:28:00| and then there is a notice for extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| And we need clarity whether a contract that is four years can be extended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| or can it only be renewed or can we have a whole new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| That's the ambiguity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| That's the legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| Somewhere in that realm somebody is going to have to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| because what we have before us is one that actually creates a whole new contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| while you have another four-year contract in force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5306)|
| 1:28:30| And there is legislative intent and prior attorney opinions to the contrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5310)|
| 1:28:37| So there is ambiguity out there, and we discussed this with the board at the time of their vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5317)|
| 1:28:42| that there was potential ambiguity as it related to the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5322)|
| 1:28:47| If we had one, when we gave them legal form, there was no ambiguity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| but we didn't extend the contract beyond the four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| The motion was made at the end to amend the contract in such a way as to get an attorney general opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5337)|
| 1:29:07| So right now we're waiting to see if it's in legal form for term alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5347)|
| 1:29:12| There are several other issues, but that was the one that has been floating out there this whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5352)|
| 1:29:21| I'm kind of leaning toward, and I'm not going to make a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| but I'm kind of leaning toward come next Monday waiting until the attorney general has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| if we're going to get an issue, a request, and if they're going to issue an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| But would you send us an email as a commission to stipulate as to what the issues are with the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5372)|
| 1:29:39| Because I don't want to vote on something that's going to come back and put us in a legal bind with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5379)|
| 1:29:46| I think it's unwise for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| So Monday I'm probably going to lean toward postponing our vote until an attorney general has made a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5388)|
| 1:29:55| But I'd also like to know what the other issues are with the contract that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| And I don't know if that's an executive issue, but I'd like to see sometime over the next week or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5399)|
| 1:30:05| What you have before you, though, and I want this commission to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| we have a legal offer tendered to the superintendent by those who have the statutory power to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5410)|
| 1:30:18| And that vote matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| And this is one of those, it's over here only because of the consent agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5421)|
| 1:30:27| If we not have the consent agreement, it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| You understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| And they were on notice, the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| At least I thought they understood until the issues that were brought up today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5435)|
| 1:30:42| I thought they understood that there were a lot of legal concerns about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| that the law director's office had given them a template of legal form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5445)|
| 1:30:51| and then they brought in another one at that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| And then we got it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| What you have before you, and I want this commission to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| is the exact contract that they voted on and that was signed by the chairman that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5460)|
| 1:31:08| Not a word of that contract has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| The only thing of the contract was changed was when I reviewed it, it had to do with legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5470)|
| 1:31:17| Nothing more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| And Dr. McIntyre currently has an offer extended to him for his consideration from the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5479)|
| 1:31:29| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| One of the things that bother me so much about some of these things that comes over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| is how it gets politicized in everything that's done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| Number one, I was there at the Board of Education meeting that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| and it said that we had concerns, and it was asked, do you have concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5508)|
| 1:31:54| And, Mr. Law Director, I applaud you in repeating that there are concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5514)|
| 1:32:00| of getting this county into a contract that's worth a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5520)|
| 1:32:08| that we're going to have to fund in some way down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| But it was told to the Board of Education that it was not in legal form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5533)|
| 1:32:18| and they went ahead and voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| And that bothered me to some extent, that they would go ahead and vote for a contract that's not in legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5541)|
| 1:32:33| And, like I said, again, I applaud you for mentioning that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| but to have somebody that votes something that could come down to haunt the county in a financial way is not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5557)|
| 1:32:49| And looking back on this, how it happened, and how quickly it happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5569)|
| 1:32:56| and why it was asked by some members on that board to postpone to where they could find out if it was legal or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5576)|
| 1:33:05| or if there was a problem in the wording in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| And it was pushed through, and it was pointed out on the BOE that night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5588)|
| 1:33:15| that if they didn't vote it on that night, the next time they would be able to vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| it would be out of the realm of this current body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| Is that correct, the BOE body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| That was their understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| The truth, when we started counting the days after that particular meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| they probably could have heard it and still could have heard it in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| And we re-searched the thing, and I told a lot of the board members later that it has to do with the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5616)|
| 1:33:44| But the whole issue, when we were in negotiations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| and let me let everybody understand that the law director's office worked with the chairman of the Board of Education on this particular contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5629)|
| 1:34:03| And then we worked, several of four people on my staff worked on a legal form contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5643)|
| 1:34:09| because we're required to by the charter to make the deadline for their Monday meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5649)|
| 1:34:15| And we worked on that through the Thanksgiving holidays to get a contract in legal form for the board to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| We presented that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| And that was the one that we felt met legal form due to some legal changes from the Affordable Care Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5664)|
| 1:34:33| and some other issues that had happened since the prior contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| At the same time, we did have issues about how it may or may not be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5678)|
| 1:34:45| And so at the time then, from that moment on, once we give the advice, as we do this board many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5685)|
| 1:34:56| I always say from this point on, it's a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| And the board made a policy decision to create a contract and offer it to Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5700)|
| 1:35:08| And they have the power to do that, and they're the only ones in the county that have the power to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5708)|
| 1:35:14| I want this board to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| And they voted, and the contract is presented to Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| We do have some questions, and they understand there are some questions outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| They knew that when they voted on the contract, because one of them is in writing that it's outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| So there's some ambiguity there in terms of legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5733)|
| 1:35:38| And we're waiting to hear what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| But they wanted to go ahead and offer the contract to Dr. McIntyre subject to certain conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5740)|
| 1:35:47| And that's their right and their power to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| The thing that got me that night, why it seemed like it was pushing so hard, was that 45-day, to get it within that 45-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5753)|
| 1:36:02| Now that you say that we can have it in January to let them vet that and get it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5762)|
| 1:36:09| I don't understand why it's being forced over here and not in legal form for us to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5769)|
| 1:36:16| It's taking the oath of office to abide by the Tennessee Constitution and the state laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5776)|
| 1:36:25| This is in the illegal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| And in my opinion, I cannot vote for it because it's illegal, as of right now, by your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5787)|
| 1:36:35| It could be legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| And then again, it could not be legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| So we're being forced to vote on an ambiguous document that didn't come to us in proper form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5799)|
| 1:36:48| For I don't know what reason, why couldn't it have waited until January to be brought before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| It was not a 100% vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| It was a 5-4 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| But it was still pushed through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| And it seems like it has to do with politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| And I can't vote for that kind of wrangling around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| And so my vote would be either a pass vote or a no vote because it is in that kind of form as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5828)|
| 1:37:19| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| I have to apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| Commissioner Ornby-McKenzie, you'll have to arm wrestle who's next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| Commissioner Ornby can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| You can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5848)|
| 1:37:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| So I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| I won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| I won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| You had your microphone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| He wasn't prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| Stronger than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| So, you know, there's a lot of things that get thrown out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5858)|
| 1:37:43| I heard illegal contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| And I do think you backed a little bit off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| It's not an illegal contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| There's maybe not in legal form, maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| And that's what you've asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| So I want to make sure that gets out there to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| This isn't an illegal contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| The second thing that I have for you, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5881)|
| 1:38:07| our duties as it relates to this contract as commanded by the order are financial, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5887)|
| 1:38:21| Are the issues that are maybe not in legal form financial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5901)|
| 1:38:31| And before you say, because we can issue, I think people, I've heard a couple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5911)|
| 1:38:36| we're approving this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| We're not approving this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| It's already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5919)|
| 1:38:40| And, yeah, I appreciate you saying that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| So could you answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| Well, this contract is already approved by the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| It's extended to Dr. McIntyre until either he accepts it or the board withdraws it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5928)|
| 1:38:53| It's an active offer and waiting on acceptance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5933)|
| 1:38:58| There are financial implications to some of the areas of the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5938)|
| 1:39:04| where it may or may not be enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| You know, if you can extend it to a full four years, that has implications, financial implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5949)|
| 1:39:16| If you can only renew it in 2017, that has financial implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5956)|
| 1:39:22| But those are issues that the Board of Education took in consideration, and they voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5962)|
| 1:39:30| And bottom line, like I said before, if it weren't for the agreement, it wouldn't even be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5970)|
| 1:39:38| They have a statutory power and duty to contract with a director of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5978)|
| 1:39:45| Now the question is, how do they have to do that, and how does that affect terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5985)|
| 1:39:51| and how does that affect liquidated damages, and how does that affect different elements of the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5991)|
| 1:39:57| Those are the questions that some of them are waiting on an opinion on because they asked for the opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=5997)|
| 1:40:04| And that created a legal ambiguity in this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6004)|
| 1:40:10| which I couldn't come and say it is legal until we know that the ambiguities are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6010)|
| 1:40:16| Okay. So, you know, I know the chair is not here, but the vice chair is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6016)|
| 1:40:21| I'd like to ask her if she would like to come and just kind of give maybe her take on what happened on this date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6021)|
| 1:40:32| Anything else you want to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6032)|
| 1:40:39| Thank you, Mr. McKenzie and Chairman Wright for having me and commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6039)|
| 1:40:45| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| Tracy Sanger, and it's 5216 Catalina Road, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| I tell people that all the time, and I forgot myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| It's my understanding, Mr. McKenzie, that the contract we did actually submit the original contract to our law director a week ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6057)|
| 1:41:08| And so I found it interesting that there was all this hoopla about last minute changes because a week of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6068)|
| 1:41:16| we really should have had all that nailed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| So I thought that was interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| And we went through time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| We took breaks, read over parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| It was our understanding at the time the law director also agreed that if we did postpone it, that we might not be able to vote for a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6089)|
| 1:41:39| There were some suggestions about letting the new board members vote to come on, like Commissioner Bussler suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6099)|
| 1:41:49| But I thought that was interesting, too, because that means people would have been in office for almost two years before they voted on a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6109)|
| 1:41:57| So I don't necessarily agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| I think the people who are elected for the elected officials need to represent their areas and make the best decisions they can for their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6119)|
| 1:42:08| Regarding the changes, we went through each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| It does state in there that the attorney general deems it ineffective by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6133)|
| 1:42:31| I would like to clarify that the school board did not actually suggest or request that opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6151)|
| 1:42:39| It did come from our law department, and it was over the word extension and renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6159)|
| 1:42:46| And I did ask for what I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| I've said over and over again, I've been hard on Dr. McIntyre's staff, and I'll be hard here on our law director as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6170)|
| 1:42:57| I'm big on paper trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| I said we need paper trails on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| And so when it was stated by our law director on November 30th at our meeting that we're waiting for an opinion from our attorney general on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6181)|
| 1:43:12| there's no paper trail that it was requested to the state to ask the attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| So I'm big on paper trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| So I have an issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| I don't necessarily remember us having an issue with damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6203)|
| 1:43:27| I know that it was changed, but also I have an issue with the fact that it's been 14 days since that contract was approved, five to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6207)|
| 1:43:39| And I just don't know why we can't say in 14 days whether or not that's an issue, whether or not that is in legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6219)|
| 1:43:50| And I guess my issue, and I talked to the law director, Thomas, over here, or Armstrong, I'm sorry, over here before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6230)|
| 1:44:00| And we talked about some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| And one of my main issues, and it's been growing, is that our law director can tell us if it's legal form or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6242)|
| 1:44:11| but he doesn't want to or can't tell us, give us advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6251)|
| 1:44:16| And, Mr. Messler, I would like to give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| Like if I hired you as my attorney, and you could only tell me if it was legal form or not, and you couldn't tell me what to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6259)|
| 1:44:28| but you also then submitted a form and said you didn't like it without consulting me, who I'm your client, I would fire you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6268)|
| 1:44:39| So, I mean, that's one of my main issues with this, is that, you know, I think it comes down to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6279)|
| 1:44:45| and you're right, I think it's politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| And, you know, it could come back either way, really, because I saw that go in a different way than you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6287)|
| 1:44:52| and that's just a different perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| But, I mean, the reality is it was a 5-4 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| Whether or not you agree with it or not, it was a 5-4 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| You know, our law director, Armstrong, said it was a legal document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| It was approved by the board, by state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| And, you know, I don't think there's really much more to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| I think that you all, you know, I think that it was, unfortunately, with things that happen in politics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6313)|
| 1:45:19| you know, that was my concern, that this was going to happen tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6319)|
| 1:45:23| only because that was written on that document that wasn't on there the night that we left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6323)|
| 1:45:30| And it wasn't consulted with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| It wasn't consulted with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| So, I was surprised that this came before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| You're through, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| I need to pause this for just a second, because we had a sign-up public forum to address this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6347)|
| 1:45:55| and I've seen the lady reenter the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| Ms. Meyer, would you have five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6358)|
| 1:46:09| Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| Lyda Mayer, 4721 Clark Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| I didn't know this was on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| I can't say I'm very informed about the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| but I know I was appalled to see that they were considering way ahead of time renewing the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| I think he's done a very bad job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| I think the teachers I've talked to think that, and it looks like it's already a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6386)|
| 1:46:33| But I'm beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| Sorry, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| I believe I can get a unanimous on this next motion that we suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6402)|
| 1:46:48| Because we have a motion on the floor, I would ask that someone move we suspend the rules so we can take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6408)|
| 1:46:58| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| All in favor of returning at 7 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6420)|
| 1:47:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6426)|
| 1:47:07| Good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| We will reconvene at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6432)|
| 1:47:13| I've got to have all in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| Are there any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| Hearing none, it must have been unanimous, and we stand until 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6438)|
| 1:47:27| Okay, I think we're all, I view a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| Commissioner Oyenbee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6451)|
| 1:47:32| There is a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6452)|
| 1:47:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6453)|
| 1:47:34| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6454)|
| 1:47:35| Chairman, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| It really, this thing's already passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| It doesn't, I mean, this is symbolic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| It's because the agreement we have with them, it has to come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| So us postponing it or anything isn't going to change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6469)|
| 1:47:54| Once he signs the contract, it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| And I went to the Board of Ed meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6477)|
| 1:48:01| I listened to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| And it started being political the minute the meeting started over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6483)|
| 1:48:09| That was when it got all political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| And it was said several times, the reason we're doing this now is because we don't want to do this during election time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6491)|
| 1:48:17| That was all stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| So, yes, am I happy about the extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| As a taxpayer, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| But it's not our choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| They made the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| It's been extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| But it still doesn't mean that we can't question or bring up concerns about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6514)|
| 1:48:39| I don't know what the rush was to, and it was brought up several times in the Board of Ed meeting, why rush to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6519)|
| 1:48:47| We've got two more years on this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| There's no rush to do this until we get up to the end of that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6529)|
| 1:48:55| But there is some concerns, and the law department has brought up about several things in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6535)|
| 1:49:06| But they chose to approve this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| I will not be voting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| But it's not because I don't think he deserves one or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| That's for them to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| I just don't think that it's in legal form, as the law director says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6558)|
| 1:49:24| And I just don't want to support something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6564)|
| 1:49:28| I would like to hear from maybe Amber or Patty to get that perspective on that side of the other end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6568)|
| 1:49:38| So Amber will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| I know Patty said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| She delegated that to Amber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| But, I mean, I think it's important that you hear both sides of that meeting that night, because it was a long meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6584)|
| 1:49:52| And there was a lot of points brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6592)|
| 1:49:56| But it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| We could all vote it 11-0, vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6599)|
| 1:50:03| It's still going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| Or we can all vote 11-0 to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| It still has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| But I would like to hear from Amber about her perspective of that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6611)|
| 1:50:17| Thank you, Commissioner Ownby, Chair, fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| I guess since Patty said Amber, I will come up and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6622)|
| 1:50:27| And my name is Amber Roundtree, and my address is 2604 Fisher Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6627)|
| 1:50:34| I guess, yes, as Commissioner Ownby said, it was a very long and tedious meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6634)|
| 1:50:41| I think I needed a coffee IV drip to get through that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6641)|
| 1:50:44| But I think just the reality is there were lots of legal questions and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6644)|
| 1:50:52| And I did hear Commissioner McKenzie state that he felt like he watched the meeting and thought that the legal issues were fully vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6652)|
| 1:51:00| I'm not sure if it's the practice of this body to make snap decisions on million-dollar contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6660)|
| 1:51:07| I personally don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| I don't feel like it would be doing my fiduciary duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| So when you walk into a meeting and you're given two drafts of a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| and you're expected to make a decision with taxpayer funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| while we did have a very lengthy and rigorous discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| I do not agree that that contract was fully vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| And I do believe that, excuse me, Law Director Armstrong several times stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6689)|
| 1:51:35| that there were concerns with the wording of certain parts of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6695)|
| 1:51:40| So I myself, I was the one that tried to amend the contract, tried to make a motion to postpone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6700)|
| 1:51:46| because I personally would have been much more comfortable to vote on a contract that had been fully vetted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6706)|
| 1:51:53| and not rushed to be voted on that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6713)|
| 1:51:57| So if anybody has any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6717)|
| 1:52:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6722)|
| 1:52:03| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6723)|
| 1:52:04| You have a question of the presenter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6726)|
| 1:52:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| Ms. Rountree, I would like you just again to restate that fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6728)|
| 1:52:15| that the first time you saw this piece of paper were handed to you when you got to the meeting that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6735)|
| 1:52:24| There were two different versions that were given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6744)|
| 1:52:27| And I guess just to back up a little bit, I believe that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| and the Law Director could probably speak to the timeline much better than I could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| but we received our agenda for that meeting, I believe, late Wednesday afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6754)|
| 1:52:41| right before the Thanksgiving holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| And my understanding was that the Law Director had been working with the Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6763)|
| 1:52:48| to diligently make sure that all the changes were made that needed to be made to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6768)|
| 1:52:54| And I think it was, you know, most folks were taking vacation or out of town or traveling for the holiday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6774)|
| 1:53:02| and we had our meeting on the Monday after Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| So I know I was traveling with my family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| and I didn't have access to necessarily sit down and study it in depth at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6788)|
| 1:53:13| I did make time to study it, and that day I studied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| But we also, when we got to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| had a version that the Law Director's office had made some more additional changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6799)|
| 1:53:24| in light of further discussions with the Chair and Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| That was my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6808)|
| 1:53:30| I think the reality of what it all boils down to is that the contract was not running up on December 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6810)|
| 1:53:38| There was no need for us to make that weighty decision that evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6818)|
| 1:53:43| given that there were considerable legal questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| and that was why I felt that I couldn't support the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6831)|
| 1:53:52| Well, from what I hear you saying is that there are things that you did not like about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6832)|
| 1:53:58| that you would have wished to change, and you did not get a chance to get those vetted out that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6838)|
| 1:54:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| Well, I tried to make quite a few motions to get some things changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| and some of them failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| And so my goal at that meeting was just to give us some more time to read through the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6854)|
| 1:54:20| And we did, as Ms. Singer said, we did take a break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6860)|
| 1:54:24| but I find it very difficult to give a contract that's very detailed your full attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6864)|
| 1:54:31| in a crowded room in the A.J. building with lots of folks in there talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6871)|
| 1:54:36| So I think it was just, if you were at the meeting, I know some of you were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| it wasn't an ideal condition in which to study and make a decision with taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6879)|
| 1:54:46| That's kind of like the mayor handing us a budget on Monday morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6886)|
| 1:54:51| before we're supposed to vote on it Monday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| You know, this is, that's not a small amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6894)|
| 1:55:00| You're talking about a major amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| And I would applaud you and your three cohorts for standing up for what you believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6902)|
| 1:55:09| and trying to get information that would maybe have gotten us out of here 45 minutes ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6909)|
| 1:55:17| had it been done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| So thank you very much for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6919)|
| 1:55:21| Other questions of this presenter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6921)|
| 1:55:24| Or Ms. Bounds is still back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6924)|
| 1:55:29| Oh, and I see Ms. Dether just still over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6929)|
| 1:55:33| Thank you, Ms. Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6934)|
| 1:55:35| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6935)|
| 1:55:39| I actually have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| Amber, you had said that you were presenting with two versions of the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6942)|
| 1:55:46| and I was just wondering where did the second version of the contract come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6951)|
| 1:55:52| When we came in, we had two different versions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| One was marked at the top, board version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| and there was a version at the top marked, I believe, law director version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| Is that correct, Mr. Armstrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| I can't remember what the notation was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| That was the essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| We had one that we had prepared over the week to try to get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| We got it out about 1 o'clock to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| Was that the board version?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| No, that was the legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| And then there was another one that was titled board version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6985)|
| 1:56:26| And in the process, they had the two side-by-side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| and they worked through the two contracts until they came up with a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| what you might want to say is a third, the one that we have before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6994)|
| 1:56:38| that was actually voted on and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=6998)|
| 1:56:41| And then it was amended, redone, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7001)|
| 1:56:45| as they voted and sent over to the law director's office for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7005)|
| 1:56:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7012)|
| 1:56:53| So where did the board version come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7013)|
| 1:56:58| I don't really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| It was there when I got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| It was laying on everybody's desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| I mean, I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| And here's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| It boils down just to the very basic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| Based on the consent decree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7033)|
| 1:57:18| and the fact that part of what we're being asked to vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7038)|
| 1:57:23| is not in proper order or in legal form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| as our attorney and as our advisor, what do you recommend that we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7047)|
| 1:57:35| Well, I can't tell you how to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| All this notation says is that in this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7059)|
| 1:57:44| there are some elements that may not be enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7064)|
| 1:57:48| But the contract itself has a severability clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7068)|
| 1:57:52| So anything in there that may not be enforceable does not void the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7072)|
| 1:57:57| It's still a contract that is a legal contract if accepted and bound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7077)|
| 1:58:03| but there may be elements in it that may fly or may not fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7083)|
| 1:58:08| And we have one of them that is a question to the attorney general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7088)|
| 1:58:12| which will be clarified at some point in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7092)|
| 1:58:17| And that's really the legal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| I mean, there's a lot of legal issues around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| It's not a policy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| The policy issue has already been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| The board has voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7107)|
| 1:58:30| So you have a legal contract that has been passed by an administrative board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7110)|
| 1:58:41| and the statute gives them the power to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7121)|
| 1:58:45| Like I said, if it weren't for the consent agreement, it wouldn't even be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7125)|
| 1:58:52| The only reason it's over here is because of the consent agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7132)|
| 1:58:56| And beyond that, it's before you to do as you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7136)|
| 1:59:04| But the effect of it is we have a contract on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7144)|
| 1:59:08| offered to a director of schools by the appropriate body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7148)|
| 1:59:12| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| I have an accounting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| For item number 14, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7160)|
| 1:59:24| in the event of such termination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| Knox County Board of Education shall pay to the superintendent his full salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7167)|
| 1:59:31| consistent with the terms of this contract from the actual date of termination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7171)|
| 1:59:35| established by the Knox County Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| through the expiration date of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7178)|
| 1:59:41| Now, under compensation, it says it shall be $227,256 on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7181)|
| 1:59:52| My question is how much has to be set aside to the unassigned balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7192)|
| 2:00:00| or reserve account to cover this obligation, and is that money available to do so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7200)|
| 2:00:08| Is that a question, Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| This is a question I guess that you're addressing to the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| Yes, sir, Bob Thomas, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7216)|
| 2:00:20| Commissioner, we at some point several years ago did put a reserve on that total amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7220)|
| 2:00:27| What I can't stand here and tell you tonight is that that reserve is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| Our fund balance situation, of course, we got down fairly close to the 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7231)|
| 2:00:37| So I'm going to have to check to be sure if that reserve is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7237)|
| 2:00:42| But we did it several years ago upon the advice of the county finance director at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7242)|
| 2:00:49| Where did that go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| Pardon me, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7251)|
| 2:00:52| Where did that go, the reserve that was there to cover that obligation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7252)|
| 2:00:56| The fund balance, it would just be a reserve, which is legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7256)|
| 2:01:00| makes it legally required to be used for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| So that would be the appropriate thing to do is to have a reserve in the amount of the full contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7264)|
| 2:01:09| because that's the liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7269)|
| 2:01:14| Mr. Caldwell, did you wish to give an opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7274)|
| 2:01:20| Chris Caldwell, front of Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7280)|
| 2:01:21| I don't know if I wish to opine, but I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7281)|
| 2:01:26| I'm looking at my handy-dandy smartphone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7286)|
| 2:01:30| In 2014, we did have $1 million set aside in committed fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7290)|
| 2:01:36| I can't sit here and tell you that was for that contract, but it was for some contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7296)|
| 2:01:42| That is not there in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| What is there basically is $2.4 million in what we call non-spendable fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7306)|
| 2:01:53| I know I'm boring you all to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| And then $240,000 in assigned and $13.3 in unassigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7315)|
| 2:02:03| The unassigned is the important piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| That's where the 3% has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| Here's what I would say, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7328)|
| 2:02:10| This is a large contract that is material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| And so once that contract is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7334)|
| 2:02:18| I would assume what we need to do is treat it like any other contract and encumber that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7338)|
| 2:02:25| and it be encumbered, and then each year it's brought down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7345)|
| 2:02:29| And so that's how, to me, the accounting of it should be treated, is to treat it as an encumbrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7349)|
| 2:02:37| But the funds are there to encumber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7357)|
| 2:02:41| Well, I don't know what the 3% number is, but there are funds there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7361)|
| 2:02:46| I thought you said there was $2.4 that was unassigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7366)|
| 2:02:50| No, I said $13.3 that's unassigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| Now, what amount of that is the 3%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7374)|
| 2:02:55| I want to think that the number was about $600,000 over the 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7375)|
| 2:03:01| That's what I want to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| And I think it might have finished a little stronger than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| but before the books closed and all, we were looking at $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| I think it maybe is around $900,000, $950,000, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7389)|
| 2:03:14| It went up just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7394)|
| 2:03:19| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7399)|
| 2:03:22| Has Commissioner Brown spoke on this before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7402)|
| 2:03:26| Commissioner Brown, I think, is going to call for the question, but I'm going to shortstop him here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| No, I'm going to ask for a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7410)|
| 2:03:35| That's always in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7415)|
| 2:03:37| I'll tell you why I asked that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7417)|
| 2:03:39| If you speak on a subject, everybody has to speak on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7419)|
| 2:03:43| or who wants to speak on it before it comes back to the person again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7423)|
| 2:03:48| It's in Robert's Rules of Order No. 49 in the document on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7428)|
| 2:03:52| So I'm just saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| And, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate you giving me this time, but, Ms. Sanger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7435)|
| 2:04:00| I want to tell you I would have voted for this contract if it had came over here in legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7440)|
| 2:04:08| It was asked by the board that you're on for a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| which would not have affected you all voting on it in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7453)|
| 2:04:19| yet it comes over here and we're having discussions on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7459)|
| 2:04:22| which we shouldn't have had because it's not in legal form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7462)|
| 2:04:26| and because I took an oath of office that says we have to vote or if we're going to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7466)|
| 2:04:32| and our law director gave us an opinion that it's not in legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7472)|
| 2:04:36| I can't vote on anything that's illegal, and this is not legal, so it must be illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7476)|
| 2:04:44| But, anyway, I guess I'm going to get an appointment by our law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7484)|
| 2:04:49| but that's the only reason I was saying that is that it was asked to be postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7489)|
| 2:04:54| and I would have rather had it over here in a good form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7494)|
| 2:04:58| I know I'm going to get spoke to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7498)|
| 2:05:03| I've never spoken to you that much before, so I'm excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7503)|
| 2:05:06| But I would just like to address that again, that our law director has said it is a legal document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7506)|
| 2:05:12| It is a legal document, but there is a question as to if something is of legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7512)|
| 2:05:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7521)|
| 2:05:22| It's a legal document before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| There are elements in it that may or may not be enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7524)|
| 2:05:28| Okay, and so let's say, for example, in 2013, the superintendent's contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7528)|
| 2:05:34| it said that to fire a superintendent, you had to have supermajority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7534)|
| 2:05:38| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7538)|
| 2:05:39| And then the attorney general came back and said that if that is not correct, it's five to four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7539)|
| 2:05:44| so that was not enforceable, but it was a legal document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7544)|
| 2:05:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7548)|
| 2:05:49| That's correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7549)|
| 2:05:50| Okay, I feel like I've gone to law school today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7550)|
| 2:05:52| Okay, so basically that's what this document is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7552)|
| 2:05:56| It is a legal document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| There may be a couple things in there when the attorney general, we're still waiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7557)|
| 2:06:01| it's been over 14 days since apparently we've asked for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7561)|
| 2:06:06| So if that, and it's over one word, over one word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7566)|
| 2:06:11| and that one word has actually been in all the other contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7571)|
| 2:06:16| and it will be interesting to see, too, because if that's overturned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| they're going to be, it may actually void most of the superintendent contracts in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7580)|
| 2:06:26| if it's that one word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| So, I mean, just think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| Like, I don't think, I think we're all focusing on the five to four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7590)|
| 2:06:33| and if people could vote or not vote, you know, coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7593)|
| 2:06:37| but really it is, it's just a legal document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| It's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7600)|
| 2:06:41| There are a couple things that may not be legal for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7601)|
| 2:06:44| I would suggest or hope that you vote to pass it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| because if and when we hear back from the attorney general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7607)|
| 2:06:51| it will still be a legal document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| One or two things may not be enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7615)|
| 2:06:56| That happens all the time in contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| I don't think that's uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| So I would hope that you will vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7626)|
| 2:07:07| Let me go back and let me see if I can explain this a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7627)|
| 2:07:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7631)|
| 2:07:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7632)|
| 2:07:13| I was there the night that, you know, it went on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| and it was requested to where they could look at it a little bit farther| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7636)|
| 2:07:21| because of that instance of a ruling by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7641)|
| 2:07:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7646)|
| 2:07:27| The law director gave an opinion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7647)|
| 2:07:31| We have a fiduciary responsibility to the county to look at certain things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7651)|
| 2:07:36| and ask questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| And my question is, with any contract that comes through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7658)|
| 2:07:42| is it in legal form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7662)|
| 2:07:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7665)|
| 2:07:46| The opinion of the law director, who I respect, says it's not in legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7666)|
| 2:07:53| Therefore, it has to do with monetary value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7673)|
| 2:07:58| and if it has to do with monetary value and it's not in legal form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7678)|
| 2:08:02| I don't see how we can vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7682)|
| 2:08:06| Because if it says, okay, the contract is null and void by the state attorney general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7686)|
| 2:08:15| then it's really not a contract, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| I mean, that's just the way I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| And I'm sorry, but I'm putting you on the spot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7699)|
| 2:08:23| Let me help you a little bit, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| Can you help me out a little bit here, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| The contract is not, because an element of the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7708)|
| 2:08:34| insert, let me rephrase this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| because something in the contract may or may not be enforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7717)|
| 2:08:41| there is what we call a severability clause or a saving clause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7721)|
| 2:08:45| that saves the contract in terms of its legality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7725)|
| 2:08:49| even if something within it is not enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| So, for example, if for some reason one of the issues is found to be unenforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7733)|
| 2:09:02| the rest of the contract as voted on is enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7742)|
| 2:09:06| The contract itself will still be a legal binding document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| but it's like Ms. Sanger brought out on the evaluation vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7750)|
| 2:09:16| the super majority evaluation vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7756)|
| 2:09:20| Attorney General Opine that that was not enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| Well, okay, so in that part of the contract it's not enforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7763)|
| 2:09:27| but the rest of Dr. McIntyre's contract was enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7767)|
| 2:09:31| And what we're saying to this board tonight is we have an ambiguity out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| that may or may not be enforceable that I can't say that's enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7775)|
| 2:09:39| We're waiting on an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| But that does not speak to the entirety of the contract being unenforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7781)|
| 2:09:47| The contract, we have a legal contract offer to Dr. McIntyre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7787)|
| 2:09:53| approved by the administrative board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| And beyond that, that's where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7796)|
| 2:10:00| and we're just waiting on an opinion about one element in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7800)|
| 2:10:04| to see if it in fact is enforceable as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7804)|
| 2:10:08| Once we know that, if not, then we'll probably go back to the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7808)|
| 2:10:11| and say we've got to just do something about it because it is a term issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7811)|
| 2:10:16| It's not just something that just falls off to the wayside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7816)|
| 2:10:19| But this is not void of contract is what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7819)|
| 2:10:24| Right, and Commissioner Bissell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7824)|
| 2:10:25| referring I think to the incident you were talking about at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| where there was an objection to the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| I mean, that actually took me a five-second Google to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7829)|
| 2:10:33| that you can only object to the question actually at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7833)|
| 2:10:36| And so that really should never even have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| And then we were given advice also about whether or not it was six votes to defeat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7838)|
| 2:10:43| but it's really six votes to sustain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| So, you know, that issue should never even have been an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7845)|
| 2:10:49| But, I mean, I agree with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| I think that what we've done is a legal document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| I hope that you all would go ahead and support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7855)|
| 2:10:59| Okay, thank you, Ms. Sanger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7863)|
| 2:11:04| Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7864)|
| 2:11:05| do you think it's possible we can get this opinion by next Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7865)|
| 2:11:10| I would say it's highly likely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| but I can't tell you what an attorney general is going to do or not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7872)|
| 2:11:15| And I'd like to make a substitute motion that we pass it on with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7875)|
| 2:11:20| That's the motion that's on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7880)|
| 2:11:24| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7884)|
| 2:11:27| That makes four, so you've got to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| The motion, the motion, excuse me, Commissioner Smith, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7889)|
| 2:11:36| Whose light's on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7896)|
| 2:11:38| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7898)|
| 2:11:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7904)|
| 2:11:45| As far as legal form, from what I'm hearing, we have a legal contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7905)|
| 2:11:50| We may not have legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7910)|
| 2:11:54| I think there's some elements where there is not legal form, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7914)|
| 2:11:57| But that does not void a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| It just puts you on notice that parts of the contract may or may not be enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7919)|
| 2:12:04| The bigger question I have about voting on this is I don't want to vote on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7924)|
| 2:12:08| until I have proof that we have the ability to encumber the funds to cover this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7928)|
| 2:12:16| I don't think the Board of Education's allowed to pass contracts for which they don't have the money to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7936)|
| 2:12:25| Now, seeing no further lights or requests for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7945)|
| 2:12:32| I would visit for just a second with Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7952)|
| 2:12:36| who has on the table a motion of no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7956)|
| 2:12:43| I believe that, no, I know that this Board has to vote tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7963)|
| 2:12:49| because we will not discuss this next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7969)|
| 2:12:53| We have to vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7973)|
| 2:12:55| So I would request that you withdraw or change or whatever the technical thing that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7975)|
| 2:13:02| You make a great point, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7982)|
| 2:13:03| I will change my vote that we vote to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7983)|
| 2:13:08| I'll change my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7988)|
| 2:13:10| Why do we have to vote on it tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7990)|
| 2:13:12| We cannot discuss it Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| We just talked about that at length last month, didn't we, Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| This is the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7998)|
| 2:13:19| So tonight is the night that we're—your light's not on and I'm not recognizing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=7999)|
| 2:13:26| Tonight is the night that we must, and we have, we've discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8006)|
| 2:13:32| We have discussed it at length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8012)|
| 2:13:36| Everyone has made up their mind about where we stand, which is not relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8016)|
| 2:13:46| The thing that is before us, as you may want to submit, is an invalid contract or a flawed piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8026)|
| 2:13:59| But it came from the elected Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8039)|
| 2:14:05| We have a right to discuss it tonight, and that's all the right we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8045)|
| 2:14:11| It is passed. It is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8051)|
| 2:14:14| Can I say that, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| Well, it's not an invalid contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8056)|
| 2:14:18| You have before you a valid contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8058)|
| 2:14:21| I stand corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8061)|
| 2:14:22| We have before us a valid contract approved by the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8062)|
| 2:14:29| and it is our duty come Monday to vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8069)|
| 2:14:33| It's our duty tonight to vote yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8073)|
| 2:14:38| Yes, she withdrew her second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| She approved the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8082)|
| 2:14:43| Yeah, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8083)|
| 2:14:44| She approved the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8084)|
| 2:14:45| My light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| Discussion has ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| Can I say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8089)|
| 2:14:50| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8090)|
| 2:14:51| Can I say discussion has ended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8091)|
| 2:14:59| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8099)|
| 2:15:02| I'll say it this way first, a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8102)|
| 2:15:04| We can suspend the rules any time we want to and go back on any particular subject we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8104)|
| 2:15:12| What is before us is a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8112)|
| 2:15:15| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8115)|
| 2:15:18| And you'll notice that, Amy, you're going to get to vote first, beginning in the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8118)|
| 2:15:25| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8125)|
| 2:15:28| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8128)|

| 2:15:32| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8132)|
| 2:15:34| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8134)|
| 2:15:35| You can go backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| McKenzie will be last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8137)|
| 2:15:38| I know you're so used to calling my name first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8138)|
| 2:15:43| Next time it will be Smith voting first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8143)|
| 2:15:49| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8151)|

| 2:15:54| Commissioner Ornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8154)|
| 2:15:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8155)|
| 2:15:56| Commissioner Ornby votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8156)|
| 2:15:57| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8157)|

| 2:16:20| Commissioner Brantley votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8180)|
| 2:16:22| You're not done yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8182)|
| 2:16:23| I'm not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| We're at Pam's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8185)|
| 2:16:26| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8186)|

| 2:16:28| Commissioner McKenzie votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| Do any of those that have passed wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8191)|
| 2:16:36| Commissioner Bessler or Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| Go down the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8198)|
| 2:16:39| Commissioner Bessler, do you wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8199)|
| 2:16:42| Do you wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8202)|
| 2:16:43| You wish to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8203)|

| 2:16:47| I just wish to pass the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8207)|
| 2:16:54| Mr. Thomas, may I have a point of order, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8214)|
| 2:17:06| Before the vote is announced, does anyone wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8226)|
| 2:17:14| Can I recognize him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8234)|
| 2:17:19| Okay, point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| I think point of order, the clarification is it doesn't matter how you vote tonight, it's on education consent and it's a yes vote Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8241)|
| 2:17:28| Thank you, that was my comments a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8248)|
| 2:17:35| Now then, to announce the vote, it's 6 aye, 3 no, 2 pass, motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8255)|
| 2:17:53| Madam Clerk, next item please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8273)|
| 2:18:00| Item 13 is a resolution authorizing the acceptance of grant funds for the Knox County Schools as shown on the attached list of grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8280)|
| 2:18:07| Resolution 203.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8287)|
| 2:18:11| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8291)|
| 2:18:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8292)|
| 2:18:13| There's a motion to approve and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| I see no lights, but I am the person that pulled that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8296)|
| 2:18:21| The reason being is you'll notice that it is a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8301)|
| 2:18:26| Okay, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8306)|
| 2:18:35| Have we got a motion and a second yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| No, certainly have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8317)|
| 2:18:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8318)|
| 2:18:39| I was trying to find it on my agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8319)|
| 2:18:44| What I would like to ask on this right here is what is the total funds that we are, that's on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8324)|
| 2:18:51| and will it require any additional hiring to administer these grants that we're approving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8331)|
| 2:19:01| It says grants right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| 13 is grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8344)|
| 2:19:07| Let me then back up and start where I was a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8347)|
| 2:19:11| You'll notice this is a change in the process by which we've been being presented authorization to accept funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8351)|
| 2:19:22| The Board of Education receives funding through grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8362)|
| 2:19:27| They now, I do not want to say lump them all together because they are individually listed in this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8367)|
| 2:19:37| and the resolution is to approve them all at one time as opposed to having several pages of paper taken up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8377)|
| 2:19:44| and listing all the grants, which could be of small values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8384)|
| 2:19:51| Now then, do you still have a question related to this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8391)|
| 2:19:57| All I question was the amount is, I know it's around $1,700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8397)|
| 2:20:04| Will there be any additional hiring required, or can it be handled in-house to handle these grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8404)|
| 2:20:12| Mr. Oaks, could you address, oh, excuse me, I see Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8412)|
| 2:20:17| All I need is a yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| And Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8421)|
| 2:20:22| Commissioner, the best I can remember from, I don't have the documentation that you're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8422)|
| 2:20:27| but best of my knowledge from what I remember from the board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8427)|
| 2:20:30| I do not believe those will take additional personnel to administer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| However, I would reserve the right to check, just to be sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| because I do not want to stand here and tell you something that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8439)|
| 2:20:43| But I will do that and have that information factual for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8443)|
| 2:20:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8446)|
| 2:20:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8455)|
| 2:20:56| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8456)|
| 2:20:57| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8457)|
| 2:20:58| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8458)|
| 2:21:00| Item number 14 is a resolution authorizing the acceptance of donations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| as shown on the attached list of donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8464)|
| 2:21:07| This is resolution 204.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8467)|
| 2:21:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8470)|
| 2:21:11| The motion is properly before us, properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8471)|

| 2:23:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8627)|
| 2:23:52| I need to ask a question of this particular contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8632)|
| 2:23:56| Other than it being recaptioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8636)|
| 2:23:59| what changes should we look for inside the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8639)|
| 2:24:05| Are there any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| There are none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8647)|
| 2:24:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8648)|
| 2:24:09| Mark Jones with Risk Management and Benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8649)|
| 2:24:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8651)|
| 2:24:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8652)|
| 2:24:13| What was the change in the caption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8653)|
| 2:24:14| I mean, what was the reason for the change in the caption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8654)|
| 2:24:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| Mr. Sturkey and the law department had gone over this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8661)|
| 2:24:25| We discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8665)|
| 2:24:26| We had a misunderstanding about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8666)|
| 2:24:29| I thought it was ready to go on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| and he didn't understand that that was what I'd asked to do, so it was late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8671)|
| 2:24:38| So it's my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8678)|
| 2:24:40| So it just didn't get on the agenda on time, so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8680)|
| 2:24:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8686)|
| 2:24:47| Motion to move with no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| Does the dollar amount include the option year or is just an annual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8691)|
| 2:24:57| It's an annual contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8697)|
| 2:24:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8699)|
| 2:25:00| And the same amount in the option year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8702)|
| 2:25:03| No, it's the premium increased significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8703)|
| 2:25:07| No, he's talking about in the option year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8707)|
| 2:25:08| Is it the same as the first year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8708)|
| 2:25:12| It can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8712)|
| 2:25:13| There can be an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| Your agent says no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| Well, we'll let Mr. Mann here discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8718)|
| 2:25:23| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8723)|
| 2:25:24| My name is Drew Mann, 12521 Mallard Bay Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8724)|
| 2:25:28| So I own a company called Trinity Benefit Advisors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8728)|
| 2:25:32| and we had been hired as a broker-slash-consultant to work with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8732)|
| 2:25:36| for the probably last three years, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8736)|
| 2:25:39| Probably three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8739)|
| 2:25:40| One of the things we do is acquire stop-loss insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8740)|
| 2:25:43| which is to cover the medical claims that we have in excess of a particular dollar number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8743)|
| 2:25:48| This contract will be above $450,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8748)|
| 2:25:51| And your question, Commissioner, was what happens next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8751)|
| 2:25:54| What that gives in this, we have a trigger in the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8754)|
| 2:25:57| is a maximum that they're allowed to raise our premium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8757)|
| 2:26:00| which is a protection for the county in case we end up with an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8760)|
| 2:26:05| who has an unbelievably catastrophic continuing ongoing issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8765)|
| 2:26:11| It gives you guys some protection against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| So we won't know until October or so of calendar year 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8774)|
| 2:26:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8779)|
| 2:26:20| I'd like to change my motion to a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8780)|
| 2:26:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8784)|
| 2:26:25| The second has to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| Well, I guess the only thing was that they also changed the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8787)|
| 2:26:30| Did you change the name of the outfit or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8790)|
| 2:26:33| There was a doing business as, it wasn't in the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8793)|
| 2:26:36| Is that germane to anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| Nothing was changed as far as the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8798)|
| 2:26:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8800)|
| 2:26:41| I'm just reading the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8801)|
| 2:26:42| Old caption is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8802)|
| 2:26:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8805)|
| 2:26:46| So I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8806)|
| 2:26:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8807)|
| 2:26:48| It's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8808)|
| 2:26:49| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8809)|
| 2:26:50| Second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8810)|
| 2:26:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8812)|
| 2:26:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8815)|
| 2:26:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8816)|
| 2:26:58| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8820)|
| 2:27:01| On page 10, item number 38 is a resolution adopting joint Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8821)|
| 2:27:07| Board of Education and Knox County Commission 2016 legislative priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8827)|
| 2:27:12| This is resolution 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8832)|
| 2:27:15| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8837)|
| 2:27:21| Board of Education member Amber Roundtree signed up for a public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8841)|
| 2:27:27| related to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8847)|
| 2:27:30| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8850)|
| 2:27:31| Amber Roundtree, 260 Ford Fisher Place, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8851)|
| 2:27:36| As you all probably know, this did pass our board unanimously, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8856)|
| 2:27:41| but I just wanted to come speak to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8861)|
| 2:27:44| I don't serve on the joint committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8864)|
| 2:27:46| and I just wanted to make sure that the commissioners had a real understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8866)|
| 2:27:51| of the legislative priority that was put on about charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8871)|
| 2:27:55| There are seven priorities on that list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8875)|
| 2:27:58| and I don't think it would hurt either of our bodies to remove this priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8878)|
| 2:28:03| and just have those six key priorities to focus on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8883)|
| 2:28:07| And I am really happy to see that committee continuing and working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8887)|
| 2:28:12| so we can work toward our goal of excellence for every child in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8892)|
| 2:28:17| And I do understand Ms. Bounds is on that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| and she said that some of the discussion was with regard to the state authorizer law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8900)|
| 2:28:27| and some concerns with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8907)|
| 2:28:29| But I just wanted to come and give you all a real world example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8909)|
| 2:28:32| When we had the Emerald Charter School come to us to ask for an approval of 30 additional students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8912)|
| 2:28:40| it was going to come with a price tag of $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8920)|
| 2:28:45| And so I think that, as a Board of Ed member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8925)|
| 2:28:49| I've done a fair amount of research regarding the financial costs to districts for charters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8929)|
| 2:28:56| And so the indirect costs are very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8936)|
| 2:28:59| And then when you look at the number of students that can be compounded out over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8939)|
| 2:29:05| if you just look in Nashville or Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8945)|
| 2:29:08| they're having definitely a lot of problems funding their school systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8948)|
| 2:29:12| because of the amount of money that they're sending to charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8952)|
| 2:29:17| The reality is when a student goes to a charter school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8957)|
| 2:29:20| Knox County does not get rid of one teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8960)|
| 2:29:23| We don't close one classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| We still have to pay our light bill every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8965)|
| 2:29:27| So I think that I just had some concerns with that remaining on our legislative priorities list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8967)|
| 2:29:35| And as I said, I don't serve on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| But I wanted to come and just share that with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8977)|
| 2:29:40| and urge you really to do some further research about charter schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8980)|
| 2:29:44| and how they can financially affect the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8984)|
| 2:29:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8987)|
| 2:29:49| In meeting with the legislative delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8989)|
| 2:29:51| the Board of Education has recommended that the two topics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8991)|
| 2:29:56| one topic be the BEP formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8996)|
| 2:29:58| and the other topic be technology and funding technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=8998)|
| 2:30:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9002)|
| 2:30:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9004)|
| 2:30:06| Those are two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9006)|
| 2:30:08| No, no, he's talking about their.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9008)|
| 2:30:10| That's their two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9010)|
| 2:30:11| Okay, with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9011)|
| 2:30:12| I thought he was talking about joint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9012)|
| 2:30:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9013)|
| 2:30:14| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9014)|
| 2:30:15| I believe that probably the chair was deciding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9015)|
| 2:30:18| But, yes, I know that we definitely want to talk about BEP funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9018)|
| 2:30:23| I just think out of that list of seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| my concern was with the language of the way it was written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9026)|
| 2:30:29| that both of our bodies support charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9029)|
| 2:30:33| I'm not sure that's the message we want to send to Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9033)|
| 2:30:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9038)|
| 2:30:39| Thank you, Ms. Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9039)|
| 2:30:40| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9040)|
| 2:30:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9044)|
| 2:30:45| It's strange that, I mean, I have to make the statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9045)|
| 2:30:50| This wasn't a joint education committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9050)|
| 2:30:53| You all voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9053)|
| 2:30:54| You voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9054)|
| 2:30:56| So I want to make sure that this didn't emanate from the joint education committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9056)|
| 2:31:01| It was presented to us, and we felt we could get behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9061)|
| 2:31:04| So I guess, of course, in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9064)|
| 2:31:06| this wasn't a document that we formed and crafted the language from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9066)|
| 2:31:10| So I just want to make sure that that's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9070)|
| 2:31:14| We were given this document, and we had a lot of synergy around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9074)|
| 2:31:19| Someone gave us a rock, but then subsequent to that, you all voted for it, 11-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9079)|
| 2:31:25| So I just find that strange that now there's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9085)|
| 2:31:28| But I guess my ‑‑ and I'll read you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9088)|
| 2:31:35| Has everyone read the statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| Okay, so if you read the statement, I don't mind to strike it at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9097)|
| 2:31:44| but what the committee did talk about was we wanted to have a document prepared prior to our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9104)|
| 2:31:53| And now if we vote to strike things and add things, we're not going to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9113)|
| 2:31:58| So that's, I guess, my concern is we vetted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9118)|
| 2:32:04| I brought it to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9124)|
| 2:32:05| We covered it last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9125)|
| 2:32:07| We looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9127)|
| 2:32:09| We vetted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9129)|
| 2:32:11| They presented it to the board, their last meeting, and it passed, 11-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9131)|
| 2:32:17| So now we're getting changes of heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9137)|
| 2:32:20| And while I don't disagree with any of it, once we vote, and that's my biggest problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9140)|
| 2:32:28| once we vote, it needs to mean something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9148)|
| 2:32:31| But that's for this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9151)|
| 2:32:33| I mean, you've got to vote your heart or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9153)|
| 2:32:36| But I guess my concern at this point is striking this means that it's not in alignment with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9156)|
| 2:32:49| And the school board voted unanimously that they're in alignment with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9169)|
| 2:32:53| And I guess that's my, at this point, I don't know what we would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9173)|
| 2:33:00| I don't mind to strike it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9180)|
| 2:33:01| We can strike it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9181)|
| 2:33:03| But in terms of we're going to only get so many minutes in front of the state delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9183)|
| 2:33:08| So if we spend time saying that, okay, well, school board voted for it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9188)|
| 2:33:13| We voted for it all, minus one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| It just muddies the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9195)|
| 2:33:17| To me, it would be good to give them a good, clean document that they can read, agree with, disagree with, and we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9197)|
| 2:33:25| Because as Commissioner Smith said, there are some other things that we want to talk about outside of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9205)|
| 2:33:31| So, again, my concern is not with whether we support charter schools or don't support charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9211)|
| 2:33:38| I think the majority of that statement talks about the issues with charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9218)|
| 2:33:44| But the first statement does say while we support charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9224)|
| 2:33:47| It went on to say some other things, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9227)|
| 2:33:51| But, again, I'm just concerned at this point that we can't put both of our seals to this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9231)|
| 2:34:03| Without, with a good, clean kind of vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9243)|
| 2:34:07| So that's my only concern with changing the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9247)|
| 2:34:15| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9255)|
| 2:34:16| I just wanted to, kind of along the lines of Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9256)|
| 2:34:20| We kind of met on these things and they presented them to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9260)|
| 2:34:23| But I'm really more concerned about the vouchers than I am the charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9263)|
| 2:34:28| I mean, I think these are some good legislative priorities to talk about and to strike up conversation with our delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9268)|
| 2:34:36| You know, I don't want vouchers going to private schools because I don't want the government telling private schools who and who they can't take in if they don't want to take somebody in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9276)|
| 2:34:42| So, you know, I don't want public dollars in private schools either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9282)|
| 2:34:46| But it's not for the reasons that somebody else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9286)|
| 2:34:49| But I think it's important that we do have this list of things that, you know, the teacher evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9289)|
| 2:34:55| I think we get a lot of flack about that, rightfully so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9295)|
| 2:34:59| And I think we get a lot of discussion about BEP, implementation of standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9299)|
| 2:35:04| I mean, so we can talk about charter schools and vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9304)|
| 2:35:09| But those should be the lowest things on the list for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9309)|
| 2:35:11| And, you know, this is not a – and I don't think this is in priority by number, but those are the bottom two things that I want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9311)|
| 2:35:18| I want to talk about BEP funding and teacher evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9318)|
| 2:35:21| And so I think that I support the document as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9321)|
| 2:35:25| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9325)|
| 2:35:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| No matter how you feel about charter schools, they are currently a part of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9329)|
| 2:35:34| And along with everything on this list, I think it's important we let our state legislators know how we feel about these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9334)|
| 2:35:40| And I think the main gist under this charter school section is local control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9340)|
| 2:35:47| So I don't have any objection to leaving this on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9347)|
| 2:35:52| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9352)|
| 2:35:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9354)|
| 2:35:55| I thought the original intent of this meeting on Thursday was that the Board of Education was going to submit a couple of their items that they want to have to talk to the legislature about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9355)|
| 2:36:09| And the Knox County Commission was going to submit a couple of items that were important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9369)|
| 2:36:14| And we'd only have a handful of things that we're going to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9374)|
| 2:36:18| Has that now changed from what the original intent was, or are these going to be seven items for the school, for the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9378)|
| 2:36:26| and Knox County Commission basically has zero then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9386)|
| 2:36:29| I was going to get to that in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9389)|
| 2:36:31| We're mixing apples and oranges, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9391)|
| 2:36:34| Yes, but it's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9394)|
| 2:36:36| These seven can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9396)|
| 2:36:37| We don't have to talk about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9397)|
| 2:36:39| We have our issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9399)|
| 2:36:40| They have their issues that they're going to bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9400)|
| 2:36:42| This is a document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9402)|
| 2:36:44| But I think it means something that we both support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9404)|
| 2:36:47| We don't have to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9407)|
| 2:36:49| But if we don't necessarily both support it, then that's a different question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9409)|
| 2:36:53| So I don't know if that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9413)|
| 2:36:56| And to more directly answer Commissioner Schoonmaker's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9416)|
| 2:37:00| as a part of the discussion we're having right now is to determine the two items that we want to discuss Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9420)|
| 2:37:06| Two items Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9426)|
| 2:37:08| That's also different from the document that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9428)|
| 2:37:15| I believe it's Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9435)|
| 2:37:18| I agree with that line of thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9438)|
| 2:37:21| And I think that we need to just take the Knox County Commission out of the header here because we're due our couple of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9441)|
| 2:37:30| And if we want to go on record to say we support most of these or whatever, however you want to say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9450)|
| 2:37:35| but there needs to be two separate items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9455)|
| 2:37:38| The document has nothing to do with Thursday's meeting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9458)|
| 2:37:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9461)|
| 2:37:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9462)|
| 2:37:43| This is just legislative priorities for the future, not Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9463)|
| 2:37:46| I mean, they can pass these out to all of them while they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9466)|
| 2:37:49| If they want to bring two other new ones for their two, you know, they can do that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9469)|
| 2:37:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9473)|
| 2:37:54| But I think this is a good, that this should be passed to them, but not necessarily, or it's coming from both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9474)|
| 2:38:05| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9485)|
| 2:38:08| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9488)|
| 2:38:09| Ms. Roundtree, when you all were discussing these in your board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9489)|
| 2:38:15| was there any particular two that you have more emphasis on, or are all of them, you want to lump all of them together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9495)|
| 2:38:22| And did you all realize that you have a certain length of time, and could you cover all these in that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9502)|
| 2:38:29| I think, if I could answer, I think it sounds like we're now talking about two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9509)|
| 2:38:35| Just to go back to Commissioner McKenzie's point, I believe when it was presented to our board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9515)|
| 2:38:40| that the legislative priorities were joint things that you all came up with that serve on that joint committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9520)|
| 2:38:48| I'm not sure who all the members are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9528)|
| 2:38:50| Maybe we should just raise your hand if you're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| But for me, I think that we need to focus on BEP funding and our teacher evaluation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9532)|
| 2:38:59| And my intent was not to come here tonight and take back my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9539)|
| 2:39:05| My intent was to come as a citizen of Knox County, and also as a board member, and also as a former educator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9545)|
| 2:39:11| to let our funding body know the reality of the financial impact of charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9551)|
| 2:39:17| I'm not questioning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9557)|
| 2:39:19| What I'm doing is I'm on the joint education committee, and I had a chance to take a vacation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9559)|
| 2:39:25| and I was gone that week, and I explained to the board I would be gone that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9565)|
| 2:39:29| And anyway, why I mention that is somebody else had to be gone a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9569)|
| 2:39:36| and they postponed that meeting to another week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9576)|
| 2:39:40| But I guess I wasn't that important, so that was going to be gone that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9580)|
| 2:39:43| But anyway, that's neither here nor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9583)|
| 2:39:45| My feelings are hurt a little bit by the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9585)|
| 2:39:48| So anyway, no, what it is is the way I understood it when we were talking about it at the meeting beforehand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9588)|
| 2:39:55| before we listed these, that we had only a certain length of time to discuss certain issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9595)|
| 2:40:01| I'm fine with going with all seven right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9601)|
| 2:40:04| I just want to get into hours so we can put hours out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9604)|
| 2:40:08| I think my understanding was, as a board member, is that we were supposed to come up with two topics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9608)|
| 2:40:15| and I don't know how many topics you all were coming up with to discuss at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9615)|
| 2:40:20| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9620)|
| 2:40:21| Okay, we each get two, even Stephen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9621)|
| 2:40:25| So all of these are not going to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9625)|
| 2:40:27| That's not to say that one of us personally couldn't discuss those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9627)|
| 2:40:30| I just, as I stated earlier, wanted to come here and just share information about that priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9630)|
| 2:40:36| And I'm just ready to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9636)|
| 2:40:37| Let's get our two subjects and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9637)|
| 2:40:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9639)|
| 2:40:41| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9641)|
| 2:40:43| Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9643)|
| 2:40:44| I just want to be perfectly clear, and Commissioner McKenzie can help me out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9644)|
| 2:40:48| This Board of Education-Knox County Commission Joint Committee with the legislative priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9648)|
| 2:40:53| is nothing that's going to be presented this Thursday at our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9653)|
| 2:40:56| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9656)|
| 2:40:57| Okay, just clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9657)|
| 2:40:58| They're going to have their own items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9658)|
| 2:40:59| We have our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9659)|
| 2:41:00| So we seem to be, like I think she said, we're combining two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9660)|
| 2:41:06| Okay, I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9666)|
| 2:41:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9667)|
| 2:41:08| Commissioner Ornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9668)|
| 2:41:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9673)|
| 2:41:15| Your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9675)|
| 2:41:19| We have completely clouded the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9679)|
| 2:41:22| We have before us a resolution, Item 38, from Commissioner McKenzie for approval by the Board of Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9682)|
| 2:41:31| We also have a discussion going on, taking place right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9691)|
| 2:41:35| about the two items that we, the Board of Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9695)|
| 2:41:39| are going to present at the Thursday legislative delegation discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9699)|
| 2:41:47| Now, I'm sorry that whenever we got into the discussion way back in setting the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9707)|
| 2:41:53| that I allowed these two to roll in together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9713)|
| 2:41:57| We have two separate things that we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9717)|
| 2:42:00| Now then, I wish to separate the question into a question and a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9720)|
| 2:42:10| The question is about this Resolution 901, which is before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9730)|
| 2:42:15| properly moved and seconded as presented by Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9735)|
| 2:42:21| I'm going to ask the same clarifying question that Bob asked earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9741)|
| 2:42:26| There's nothing in this resolution that says we have to present these things on at our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9746)|
| 2:42:32| So I want everybody to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9752)|
| 2:42:35| So all we're doing is saying that these are things that we both agree to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9755)|
| 2:42:41| But we're not talking about the legislative meeting with the delegation, not the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9761)|
| 2:42:49| Now, question, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9769)|
| 2:42:52| If we're going to vote on this, it's the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9772)|
| 2:42:55| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9775)|
| 2:42:56| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9776)|
| 2:42:57| I've got two lights over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9777)|
| 2:42:58| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9778)|
| 2:42:59| We'll get to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9779)|
| 2:43:00| We'll get to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9780)|
| 2:43:03| That was a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9783)|
| 2:43:06| I think the way this is written that that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9786)|
| 2:43:11| I'm looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9791)|
| 2:43:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9793)|
| 2:43:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9794)|
| 2:43:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9795)|
| 2:43:20| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9800)|
| 2:43:23| So then just for my clarification, the reason that we're voting on this list today is to not use it on Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9803)|
| 2:43:31| but send it on to the legislature because the next time we meet they would already be in session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9811)|
| 2:43:37| and it would be not relevant at that point then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9817)|
| 2:43:40| Is that the whole reason why we want to have this and send it on to them at whatever point Mr. McKenzie wants to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9820)|
| 2:43:48| What we have before us, resolution 901, item number 38, is a resolution presented by Mr. McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9828)|
| 2:43:56| Commissioner McKenzie, as a result of the discussions at the small joint committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9836)|
| 2:44:03| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9843)|
| 2:44:04| For our approval denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9844)|
| 2:44:10| It has nothing to do with the two items that we're going to subsequently discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9850)|
| 2:44:15| as the other part of the question in a moment, the two items that we will discuss Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9855)|
| 2:44:22| and the joint legislative meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9862)|
| 2:44:24| Could be two items that are on this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9864)|
| 2:44:26| It could be two completely different items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9866)|
| 2:44:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9869)|
| 2:44:30| We will discuss that when we're finished with this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9870)|
| 2:44:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9872)|
| 2:44:33| And if the resolution passes, you will forward this on to Representative Smith then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9873)|
| 2:44:40| The public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9880)|
| 2:44:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9884)|
| 2:44:49| Commissioner Odenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9889)|
| 2:44:52| The only reason I'm bringing this up is because I sit on that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9892)|
| 2:44:55| and our task was to come forth with two items that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9895)|
| 2:45:01| No, that's not what the joint committee is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9901)|
| 2:45:04| Can I speak please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9904)|
| 2:45:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9905)|
| 2:45:07| Our task was to come up with two things from the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9907)|
| 2:45:10| two things from the county commission that we could all go and talk about legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9910)|
| 2:45:14| If this is not even going to be brought up Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9914)|
| 2:45:16| I don't even know why we're even voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9916)|
| 2:45:18| It's irrelevant at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9918)|
| 2:45:20| It's a resolution properly before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9920)|
| 2:45:25| I mean, because there's nothing in here that has to do with commission at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9925)|
| 2:45:30| Then the things that we will discuss next are the two items that we will discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9930)|
| 2:45:35| with the legislative delegation Thursday in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9935)|
| 2:45:42| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9942)|
| 2:45:45| The more we talk about this, the more confusing it gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9945)|
| 2:45:50| This did not come to us as the recommendation had for those two and two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9950)|
| 2:45:57| to come from the joint committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9957)|
| 2:46:00| It came as a request from two from the school board, two from the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9960)|
| 2:46:04| That's the way it came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9964)|
| 2:46:06| If we vote on this right here as the way it's written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9966)|
| 2:46:10| you're voting totally on this one page right here, this 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9970)|
| 2:46:14| That's what you're voting on, not what's going to be presented on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9974)|
| 2:46:19| You're incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9979)|
| 2:46:21| No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9981)|
| 2:46:23| Let me, as the chair of commission, say you're incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9983)|
| 2:46:27| Mr. Law Director, I ask for opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9987)|
| 2:46:33| What's the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9993)|
| 2:46:36| I mean, you have a resolution before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9996)|
| 2:46:39| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=9999)|
| 2:46:41| I think this is from the joint board as educational priorities of both the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10001)|
| 2:46:48| and county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10008)|
| 2:46:52| But that is not what was asked of us in the Thursday meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10012)|
| 2:46:58| They're separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10018)|
| 2:46:59| Quit talking about them the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10019)|
| 2:47:02| This is totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10022)|
| 2:47:04| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10024)|
| 2:47:06| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10026)|
| 2:47:07| That's totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10027)|
| 2:47:08| Why am I wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10028)|
| 2:47:09| We're going to discuss the two items for the Thursday meeting in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10029)|
| 2:47:14| Well, you didn't hear my explanation then, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10034)|
| 2:47:18| You don't listen to me, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10038)|
| 2:47:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10039)|
| 2:47:20| Why do I talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10040)|
| 2:47:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10041)|
| 2:47:24| I'm getting tired of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10044)|
| 2:47:27| I apologize, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10047)|
| 2:47:30| What we have before us is a resolution presented by Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10050)|
| 2:47:36| It is in no way connected to the two items that we will discuss Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10056)|
| 2:47:41| unless you pick something out of these seven to present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10061)|
| 2:47:45| and it's the consensus of commission to present those Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10065)|
| 2:47:50| That's exactly what I said, and you told me I was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10070)|
| 2:47:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10073)|
| 2:47:56| The resolution is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10076)|
| 2:47:58| It's still got lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10078)|
| 2:47:59| Mr. Thomas, you wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10079)|
| 2:48:01| I know this meeting is going very quickly, so let me just say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10081)|
| 2:48:07| The commissioners that are on this joint committee can help me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10087)|
| 2:48:12| When is this document going to be used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10092)|
| 2:48:15| What's going to be happening with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10095)|
| 2:48:18| That's actually a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10098)|
| 2:48:19| I talked about it last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10099)|
| 2:48:23| As I look at the joint, I mean, it takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10103)|
| 2:48:26| So what our goal is is to say there's some things we can agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10106)|
| 2:48:31| There's a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10111)|
| 2:48:33| We talked about contracts that we're just not going to agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10113)|
| 2:48:36| We're going to end up on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10116)|
| 2:48:37| They're going to end up on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10117)|
| 2:48:39| What this is an attempt to do holistically is to put ourselves in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10119)|
| 2:48:45| that these things, state delegation, these things, not at the meeting on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10125)|
| 2:48:52| these things we agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10132)|
| 2:48:55| In principle, we agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10135)|
| 2:48:58| Not every person is going to agree with every word in every document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10138)|
| 2:49:01| You've got 20 folks you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10141)|
| 2:49:05| So everyone's not going to agree with every word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10145)|
| 2:49:08| But short snippets that say these are the type things as it relates to education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10148)|
| 2:49:15| that the school board and the commission can agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10155)|
| 2:49:19| And we feel that's powerful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10159)|
| 2:49:21| We feel this is a handy-dandy guy to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10161)|
| 2:49:24| when I'm wondering what Mike thinks or what Sam thinks or what Bob thinks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10164)|
| 2:49:29| okay, they've told me that in general they're not a big voucher fan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10169)|
| 2:49:33| or they're in favor of BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10173)|
| 2:49:36| That was the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10176)|
| 2:49:37| That's the whole point of this committee is to try to bring us closer together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10177)|
| 2:49:42| These things aren't controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10182)|
| 2:49:44| They really aren't controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10184)|
| 2:49:46| So, again, apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10186)|
| 2:49:49| Sandy tried, and we talked about it separating them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10189)|
| 2:49:52| We should have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10192)|
| 2:49:54| But let's get our minds away from that and say this is a document that has some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10194)|
| 2:49:58| things that we can in general agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10198)|
| 2:50:01| The school board voted 11-0 for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10201)|
| 2:50:03| I mean, 9-0 for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10203)|
| 2:50:05| If we can vote for it or against it, if we vote for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10205)|
| 2:50:09| then now the state delegation knows as it relates to education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10209)|
| 2:50:13| not the Thursday meeting, as it relates to education, these things, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10213)|
| 2:50:18| they kind of agree on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10218)|
| 2:50:19| It came out of committee, going to both bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10219)|
| 2:50:22| We thought that was the wise thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10222)|
| 2:50:32| The motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10232)|
| 2:50:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10245)|
| 2:50:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10246)|
| 2:50:47| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10247)|
| 2:50:52| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10252)|
| 2:50:56| If there be no objection, we've got one more item, 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10256)|
| 2:51:00| and then we'll have our discussion about the two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10260)|
| 2:51:04| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10264)|
| 2:51:05| We've got item 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10265)|
| 2:51:07| Item 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10267)|
| 2:51:08| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10268)|
| 2:51:10| This is a resolution approving a lease agreement with the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10270)|
| 2:51:14| for a satellite office space located at the Crossroads Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10274)|
| 2:51:16| in the Haas community for the Knox County Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10276)|
| 2:51:19| Knox County Trustee, and Knox County Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10279)|
| 2:51:21| This is resolution 9-0-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10281)|
| 2:51:24| I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10284)|
| 2:51:25| Mr. Arnett had to go present a eulogy at a funeral for some of their staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10285)|
| 2:51:29| and so I'd like to make a motion to be moved without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10289)|
| 2:51:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10292)|
| 2:51:35| Motion is properly before us, properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10295)|
| 2:51:37| Seeing no lights for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10297)|
| 2:51:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10301)|
| 2:51:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10302)|
| 2:51:43| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10303)|
| 2:51:45| That leaves us with the one discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10305)|
| 2:51:47| the two items that we would like to discuss with the joint delegation this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10307)|
| 2:51:54| coming Thursday at 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10314)|
| 2:51:56| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10316)|
| 2:51:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10318)|
| 2:52:00| Commissioners, just briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10320)|
| 2:52:03| some of the things that come to my mind that we would discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10323)|
| 2:52:07| and I think several of you probably may feel the same way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10327)|
| 2:52:12| the safety center, that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10332)|
| 2:52:15| we either have to move forward on it and get it done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10335)|
| 2:52:18| and one of these ways is to make sure the state is behind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10338)|
| 2:52:21| in funding maintaining this if we build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10341)|
| 2:52:25| We have to have state funds to make this happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10345)|
| 2:52:28| and I think we need to put it on our list of priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10348)|
| 2:52:33| And if that's all right with this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10353)|
| 2:52:36| I have asked Randy Nichols if he would be available to speak only for two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10356)|
| 2:52:40| minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10360)|
| 2:52:42| Impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10362)|
| 2:52:43| Tell him 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10363)|
| 2:52:46| So he says at our meeting on Thursday and be available to answer questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10366)|
| 2:52:52| if it is your decision to so let him do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10372)|
| 2:52:57| The other thing that I feel that would be important for the delegation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10377)|
| 2:53:02| know is one of the biggest problems we have here in Knox County is drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10382)|
| 2:53:07| Drugs affect every family probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10387)|
| 2:53:12| or every community at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10392)|
| 2:53:14| It's in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10394)|
| 2:53:16| It's in the workplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10396)|
| 2:53:17| It's at the detention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10397)|
| 2:53:20| We need to make sure that some of the way they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10400)|
| 2:53:27| it's legal drugs are prescribed and dispensed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10407)|
| 2:53:32| that we make sure that we have the laws in place that keep big quantities of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10412)|
| 2:53:44| these drugs being dispensed and that we have more control on how it's given to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10424)|
| 2:53:49| the people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10429)|
| 2:53:52| Thank you, Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10432)|
| 2:53:54| Commissioner Brown earlier tonight had a discussion item on that very subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10434)|
| 2:54:00| on the commission agenda and through talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10440)|
| 2:54:04| Let me just make a small comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10444)|
| 2:54:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10446)|
| 2:54:07| Bob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10447)|
| 2:54:09| I agree with you that that's top priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10449)|
| 2:54:12| but based on I've been working with Randy and the Sheriff the last two or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10452)|
| 2:54:17| three weeks on this thing and had we had his discussion today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10457)|
| 2:54:22| the state is already committed for, as he says, a substantial amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10462)|
| 2:54:28| So I think we might be wasting one of our projects we want to throw to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10468)|
| 2:54:34| because this one's already in the bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10474)|
| 2:54:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10477)|
| 2:54:38| I mean, that's just my opinion based on what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10478)|
| 2:54:40| Had he been here to do his presentation tonight, who came Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10480)|
| 2:54:46| And Commissioner Brown has him here Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10486)|
| 2:54:48| That's where I was headed to with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10488)|
| 2:54:51| And I need to back up and ask a question, Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10491)|
| 2:54:54| When you were saying using the word drugs, were you referring to prescription drugs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10494)|
| 2:54:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10499)|
| 2:55:00| Prescription drug problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10500)|
| 2:55:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10502)|
| 2:55:03| Now then, I've lost track of who was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10503)|
| 2:55:06| I'm going to go to Owenby this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10506)|
| 2:55:09| I think it was one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10509)|
| 2:55:10| No, Owenby's first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10510)|
| 2:55:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10512)|
| 2:55:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10513)|
| 2:55:17| I agree with Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10517)|
| 2:55:19| I don't want to waste this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10519)|
| 2:55:21| And I'm not saying waste it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10521)|
| 2:55:23| I mean, I think our time could be more valuably used on other issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10523)|
| 2:55:29| because I have been talking to Randy Nichols since last January about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10529)|
| 2:55:35| The state has come through and said, yes, they're going to fund it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10535)|
| 2:55:38| and it's a large amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10538)|
| 2:55:40| Now we're just trying to work on the city to pony up some too as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10540)|
| 2:55:46| I just think that we could find something else to use our time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10546)|
| 2:55:51| because this is something that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10551)|
| 2:55:54| It's just a matter of months of when it's going to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10554)|
| 2:56:00| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10560)|
| 2:56:01| I think I agree with Mr. Thomas's second item on the prescription drug use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10561)|
| 2:56:06| but I think another topic that we might want to discuss with him is road funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10566)|
| 2:56:13| It's a substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10573)|
| 2:56:15| Knox County has substantial projects in the queue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10575)|
| 2:56:19| I think the state's $6 billion in projects in the queue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10579)|
| 2:56:25| Any districts affected, Tazewell Pike, Alcoa Highway, Solway, Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10585)|
| 2:56:32| Pellissippi, I can't think of a district that's not been affected, North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10592)|
| 2:56:37| with the lack of highway funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10597)|
| 2:56:39| and I think it's imperative that they seek ways to increase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10599)|
| 2:56:44| I think it makes a big difference on our infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10604)|
| 2:56:47| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10607)|
| 2:56:48| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10608)|
| 2:56:51| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10611)|
| 2:56:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10613)|
| 2:56:55| Got me choked up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10615)|
| 2:56:56| I get to speak again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10616)|
| 2:56:58| No, I'm just teasing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10618)|
| 2:57:00| The biggest thing that we have that we've always talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10620)|
