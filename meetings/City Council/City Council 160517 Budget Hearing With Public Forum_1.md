| 1:32:36| service and there are several of these services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| out there so we're kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| evaluating those right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| this was a need that we hadn't really thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| about but was brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| to our attention and a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| cities and private institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| for that matter are dealing with this. We are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| generating a tremendous amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| of information on our Facebook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| feed, our Twitter feeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| both in what we post and then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| the responses that we get to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| from the public, all of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| are actually public record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| and they are publicly accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| I mean you can go on our Facebook page and just kind of go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| through the archive if you want to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| but if you've ever tried to find a Facebook post| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| from a year ago, you know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| those platforms are not really set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| up to do that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| thinking forward, say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| I mean we have a Mayor Madeline Rojero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| Facebook page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| well we all know that that Facebook page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| will essentially exist for another three and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| years and then we'll probably go dormant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| but that's a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| record and at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| some point in the future, either for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| legal reasons, historical reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| all sorts of potential reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| that'll be a matter of some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| interest, you know you think 50 years out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| from now it might be interesting to go back and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| what was on the Mayor's Facebook page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| in 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| if we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| take steps to preserve that ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| that's not going to be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| and this is true of a lot of digital media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| forums and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| people are starting to offer services to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| create permanent records of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| so that's the one new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| line item we've requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5651)|

| 1:34:19| Thanks Jesse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| when he made the statement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| during the legislative session things kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| picked up a little bit and were a little difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| that may be the understatement of the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| so far. We had a very very busy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| number of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| and we're glad that that's over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5673)|

| 1:44:49| right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6291)|
| 1:44:53| receiving those funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| can you speak to that Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| we did have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| federal monies for that program, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6303)|
| 1:45:05| what we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| was a program, a grant program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| that proved to be very successful to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| some of the things when we've spoken of safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| center, some of the functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| of taking people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| who would otherwise be sent to jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| for a subset of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| disorders and get them into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| assistance and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| directed toward either housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| or counseling of some sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| and we've got some, the grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| proved to be quite successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| and we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| right now, along with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| we have money which is under this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| general category that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| looking toward continuing that sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| activity, all the pieces are not put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| yet, but that's the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| is to continue diverting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| people at a level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| less than would be implied by a fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| funded safety center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| but that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| is, that's something we're working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| the money is set there for that, but it's not quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| in place yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| Michael, do you want to add anything to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| there's no agent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| so who will be in charge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| go ahead, excuse me Marshall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| I think we have the same question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| that has been in place is something that was funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| through SAMHSA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| which is the federal mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| and Helen Ross McNabb and KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| were working on that previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| and had a lot of success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| it's a pre-arrest diversion program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| that was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| program that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| ran out of funding, it was only for so many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| and it ran out of funding, but it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| something that they saw a great deal of success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| it accomplishes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| a piece of what's looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| when you talk about a safety center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| so we looked at this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| to put forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| some funding and the county has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| the county mayor has recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| a matching amount and so hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| that can be put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| in a way that we'll be able to extend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| program in the interim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| while other discussions go on for the broader safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| center concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| So will Helen Ross McNabb be running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| I don't think that's been officially determined yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| it's put in the budget to try and see if we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| figure out how to make it work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| What happens if the county doesn't match?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| The act yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| It's in their proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6443)|
| 1:47:25| budget and a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| of county commissioners are participating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| in the broader discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| so we're pretty confident that they will match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| but I would say it's just a little early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6453)|
| 1:47:35| otherwise that would stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| to be used once we did get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| a safety center concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| of some kind in place and we'd go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| to that so it's really for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| function and we think we have a good vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| but right now it's still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| a little early in the stage to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| all that put together because there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| have to be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| purchasing and procurement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| issues and others that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| have to be dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6481)|

| 1:48:11| up the aisle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| would you just briefly tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| there's several different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| flavors of folks that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| try to help in terms of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| and stabilization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| and we heard at last several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| meetings of some folks who claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| they're not eligible for housing because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| of felonies and what not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| Could you just tell us how that works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6511)|

| 1:48:35| and they go and get placed either through CARM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| or Salvation Army| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| Some folks don't want to live under a regime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| of discipline and might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| stay outside of those centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| Some folks apparently don't qualify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| because of, for public housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6527)|

| 1:48:51| because of some background issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| Could you just elaborate on that briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| Or Becky, I don't care whoever wants to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| Well, I can speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| to the felony issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| in public housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| there are certain felonies that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| restrict people from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| accessing public housing by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| federal law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| and some of those include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| sexual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6557)|

| 1:49:21| on children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| as well as violent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| drug-related felonies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| drug-related gun arrests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| there are other felonies that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| would put someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| off the eligible list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| but they could request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| and so they could present their case to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| for public housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| and indicate how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| they've improved, how their life has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| It might have happened 20 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| So it's not a straight line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| of all felonies keep you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| automatically out of public housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| forever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| I think it did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| and we had just heard that some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| said they could not get public housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| and I didn't understand at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| I think you and I had a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| to clarify so thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| Dan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| I wanted to ask a question about homeless veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| are there any special programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| that the city is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| budgeting for to contribute to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| for homeless veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| I don't think the city has a specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| veterans program that we're budgeting for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| but we are participating in some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| we've actually been working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| a regional homeless coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| on trying to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| veterans housed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| and that uses some VA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| funding that does not come through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| our office but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| Supportive Services for Veterans Families program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| and the HUD VASH program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6664)|
| 1:51:06| last year I think through that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| about 300 homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| veterans were housed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| most of those in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| and we are continuing to try to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| through that program to stay focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| on getting veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| Didn't Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| just open up a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| opened housing in two locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| apartments for permanent supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| housing for veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| and they also have a new grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| which is primarily focused on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| outreach to veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| to get them housed so all of that plays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6698)|
| 1:51:40| in this mix to stay focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| and last year's budget actually allocated some funds to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| Helen Ross McNabb with that veteran housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| so we did do that last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| I thought Flanagan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| doesn't Flanagan have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| homeless veterans? Flanagan has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| had a lot of homeless veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| they're not specifically veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6716)|
| 1:51:58| only but they do house a lot of folks there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| I want to just ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| we try to coordinate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| so that agencies don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| duplicate the same services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| is that part of the shtick of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| making it work better so to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| That's what my job is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| is trying to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| with all of the agencies, ministries, organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| and individuals who care about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| this issue to try to keep us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| focused on coordinating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| better, being more transparent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| like through this HMIS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6748)|

| 1:52:34| get people out of homelessness into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6754)|

| 1:53:24| to reuse and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| to stimulate them more economically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6806)|
| 1:53:28| in an area. With me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6808)|

| 1:53:38| so he's hit the ground running too and of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| our downtown coordinator Rick Emmett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| So we have several projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| Excuse me one second, what page are we on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6826)|

| 1:53:50| We're back to page one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| So although we go through these periods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6834)|
| 1:53:56| of disinvestment in some of these areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| it's very important for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| go through these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| with developers and put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| these investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| back into these areas and put these areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6846)|
| 1:54:08| back into reuse. Since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6848)|
| 1:54:10| I've been on board nine months as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| Director of Redevelopment we've also established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| a development team along with Bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| and Christy, Ann and myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| who evaluates with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| private developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| along with our agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| KCDC and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| CDIDB in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| establish some development assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| for them through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| pilots or TIFs. So we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| had several projects moving on as you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| know from the design stages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| into construction. Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| Ann's been a very, very, as you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| know, prominent project manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| on that. So we had phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| one going through with Cumberland, also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| going through phase two now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| and we have Sutry Landing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| Park as well as Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| Drive moving on in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| along the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| But we have other projects going through final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| design and right of way phases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| so what you see in your request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| will continue those movements on several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| projects in our redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| areas including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| Sevier Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| Magnolia Avenue and even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6912)|
| 1:55:14| worth mentioning new public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| restrooms coming downtown to Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| with that in mind, I have my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| team here if you have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| questions as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6924)|
| 1:55:26| move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6926)|
| 1:55:32| I guess I had a question on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| I think, I feel like I read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| I was told we're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| a consultant analyze the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| TIFs and Pilots. Can you talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| that decision, the pluses, the minuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6942)|
| 1:55:44| and any budget impacts it would have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| Sure. We're now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| in the process. We're putting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| together. We're not quite ready to announce it yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| but we're working on a reviving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| a little more formalized version of having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| a third party take a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| requests we have and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| working through KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| provide that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| to City Council and County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| and obviously to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| in reviewing the gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| that's there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| what assistance is in fact recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| So that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| something that once we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| receive the applications we would engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| that person to weigh in on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| Is that primarily being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6982)|
| 1:56:24| done to add transparency or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6984)|
| 1:56:26| just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6986)|
| 1:56:28| financial expert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| to analyze those numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| I'd say it's a little of both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| but more the latter. I think what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| really feel is we've got an increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| complexity of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| some of the most difficult things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| have been left out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| of development because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| they're so challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| and we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| feel there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| it would be a good thing for public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| confidence and for elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| confidence to know that when we bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| numbers that for complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| projects that go over a number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| an independent set of eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| has reviewed the gap and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| given us that information. As I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| we did employ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| a less formalized notion on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| project by project basis. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| assistance before found that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| we thought we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| could make those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| judgments after working with them pretty well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| on our own but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| we're reaching out further and reestablishing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7045)|
| 1:57:27| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| Don Michelle, I was just curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| as to are we about done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| with the apartments on Island Home Avenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| Yes we are. They're actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| going through their last phase right now. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| hope to be done with the apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| by the end of summer as we say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| they're working with plans review and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| inspections to formalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| and get their COs for occupancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| just to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| certain elements for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| prospective tenants that want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| to come in and view those project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| apartments. So it should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| be done by August? At least by the end of summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| and then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| Century Landing Park and Waterfront Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| which we began maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| 18 months ago should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| coming to completion in the summer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7089)|
| 1:58:11| Good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| Nick? Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| Yeah I was trying to understand on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| the south waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| are there new initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| in this year's budget or just continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| what we've been working on? I wasn't sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7105)|
| 1:58:27| two new initiatives over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| You have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| the Blount Avenue Streetscapes project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| which is part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7113)|
| 1:58:35| now CETA Blanche Calhoun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| commercial. They're moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| as you know with the redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| of the hospital site. Included with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| TIF is some public improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| that include the riverwalk and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| streetscape improvements to Blount Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| What you see in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| line item is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| the CI services and any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| contingencies that may fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| that's going to be the city's responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| to perform oversight while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| they do construction on that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| CI services? Construction, engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| and inspection services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| So that's done by an outside engineering firm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| We usually hire a third party consultant to oversee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| on the city's behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| And for Magnolia you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| what 4.7, 4.9 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| About 4.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| Is that in your budget or just in capital improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| That's in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| That's in our budget to oversee the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| construction. That includes some right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| easements as well and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| some CI services that's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| involved with that project as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| CI, I'm sorry. Construction, engineering and inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| And this might be for Jim but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| in the write up in the budget book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| it talked about that money being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| spent in the Magnolia Warehouse District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| but it's also along the corridor isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| I read that description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| the administration falls under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| policy and redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| but the specific money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| for the... Is it capital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| It's in the capital projects fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| And the project limits falls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7203)|
| 2:00:05| within the redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| And last question, downtown north, what's going to be happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| in the upcoming year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| Ann Wallace, would you like to speak on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7211)|
| 2:00:13| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7213)|
| 2:00:19| Good morning Vice Mayor, members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| I'm pleased to let you know that we are working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| towards the central streetscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| which is a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| that's been in the works for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| It really will actually encompass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| the area that was part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| open streets on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7233)|
| 2:00:35| Really from...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| Up to Woodland basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| Correct. From the northern limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7239)|
| 2:00:41| of the old city all the way up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7241)|
| 2:00:43| to Woodland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| We'll also have a separate project that's labeled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| the 200 block of North Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| that's directly adjacent to the White Lily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| building. There's a matter of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| some significant storm drainage issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| that need to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| along with our waterline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| that KEB identified as having been installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7259)|
| 2:01:01| in 1893.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| So it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| A little tuna?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| Quality services, it's provided a lifetime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| or several generations of lifetimes of water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| and so it's an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| to go ahead and get that service replaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| all the way from the railroad tracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| north to Woodland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| We anticipate that project going out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| for bid late this summer, early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| this fall and would be starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| construction towards the end of the year, first of next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| year and there's an estimated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7287)|
| 2:01:29| 12 to 15 month construction timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7289)|
| 2:01:31| for North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| We would have the 200 block running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| concurrently with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| the separate project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| The 200 block is separated out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| from the larger project because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| the complexity adjacent to the railroad and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| because it's a local street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| that could really benefit from just using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| local funds instead of getting into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| the federal process. So we're doing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| stormwater part and KEB is doing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| piping part? We're doing stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| KEB is doing the waterline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| replacement. The waterline itself. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| Which is all under the road I'm sure. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7321)|
| 2:02:03| How will that affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| the Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7325)|
| 2:02:07| Viaduct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| Excellent question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| We are continuing to work with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7331)|
| 2:02:13| partners at TDOT and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| our folks in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| real estate office have been closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7337)|
| 2:02:19| coordinating with TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| on the Broadway Viaduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| My understanding is that there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| not a set start date for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| Broadway Viaduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7347)|
| 2:02:29| project. There's been discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| of starting it this fall but that seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| to be a bit of a moving target because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7353)|
| 2:02:35| some of the right of way acquisition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| and some of the coordination with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| railroad that's outside the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| purview. So my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| understanding is that we will work to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| coordinate those and make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| that they are as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7367)|
| 2:02:49| limitedly impacting as they can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| but we also recognize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| this funding from TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7373)|
| 2:02:55| for Central Street has been in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7375)|
| 2:02:57| for a number of years and we need to move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| it and get it obligated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7379)|
| 2:03:02| for construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7382)|
| 2:03:04| so that there's no possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7384)|
| 2:03:06| recension of those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| Will you be running helicopter service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| from downtown to North Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| What's the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7392)|
| 2:03:14| It depends on what kind of training you want to pay for for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7394)|
| 2:03:16| What's the plan for Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7396)|
| 2:03:18| from the railroad track south to Summit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| as far as the streetscape?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| I will defer to Rick Emmett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7402)|
| 2:03:24| on that question. That's actually falling into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7404)|
| 2:03:26| the downtown core and the CBID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| so he's been coordinating that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7408)|
| 2:03:32| Thank you Rick Emmett, downtown coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7412)|
| 2:03:34| The part on Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7414)|
| 2:03:36| that we're talking about from the railroad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7416)|
| 2:03:38| tracks to Summit Hill is tricky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7418)|
| 2:03:40| and for the very reason that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| Councilman Del Vopi just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| spoke to and that is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7424)|
| 2:03:46| Gay Street or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7426)|
| 2:03:48| Gay Street Viaduct or the Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7428)|
| 2:03:50| Viaduct whenever it's closed. Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| certainly can't be closed at that same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| We haven't started the streetscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7434)|
| 2:03:56| through the old city yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| It's going to start late this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| That's going to be about a year project so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| probably talking a year or two before we can even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| start that project. So this year we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| work on a design and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| right-of-way acquisition. We found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| that's always a complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7450)|
| 2:04:12| and time-consuming matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| just to deal with right-of-way alone so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7454)|
| 2:04:16| we're going to concentrate the next little bit on trying to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7456)|
| 2:04:18| right-of-way acquired, see where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7458)|
| 2:04:20| the property lines are, get our surveys in, all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7460)|
| 2:04:22| kinds of things. So it's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| going to be a year or two out before we get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| But the design is going to start on that section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| this year. Once we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7468)|
| 2:04:30| the right-of-way determined and all those kinds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| of things, we've already had design money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| for Jackson all the way to Patton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| So this part of Central is the part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| that we have left to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| And that pretty much completes that whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7480)|
| 2:04:42| Central corridor is what we're trying to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| With Marble Alley, all the way to Woodland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7484)|
| 2:04:46| as Anne just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| With the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| 700 block still torn up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7490)|
| 2:04:52| do you know when that's going to be completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7492)|
| 2:04:54| So it's passable and open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| The 700 block, Jim Hagerman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| will be here later, but end of June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| is the latest that I heard the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| And then of course we do need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| we'll be working on those intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7504)|
| 2:05:06| because that's part of that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7506)|
| 2:05:08| to improve the intersections that are failing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7508)|
| 2:05:10| Church, not crosswalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7510)|
| 2:05:12| and stuff, but physical intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7512)|
| 2:05:14| Right, right. So that'll be the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| phase once the 700 block opens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7516)|
| 2:05:18| So there'll be some periodic closures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7518)|
| 2:05:20| and one-lane closures while we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7520)|
| 2:05:22| the work on those intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| But when Jim Hagerman's here later today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| he can give you details on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7526)|
| 2:05:28| Is the old new Sentinel site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7528)|
| 2:05:30| going to be developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7530)|
| 2:05:32| Not by us, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| Yeah, we have been approached by a private group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| that's interested in developing that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7536)|
| 2:05:38| and we're working with them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| It looks hopeful, but it's a tricky site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7540)|
| 2:05:42| That site's got some issues as many of you may know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| Underground issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7544)|
| 2:05:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7546)|
| 2:05:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7548)|
| 2:05:54| Any other questions for anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7554)|
| 2:05:56| in redevelopment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7556)|
| 2:05:58| If not, I think we can move on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7558)|
| 2:06:00| sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| Erin Gale is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7562)|
| 2:06:04| Sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7564)|
| 2:06:06| Good morning, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7566)|
| 2:06:08| Erin Gale, Director of the Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| of Sustainability. I hope by now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| you have a decent idea of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7572)|
| 2:06:14| I know sometimes that word is confusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7574)|
| 2:06:16| to folks, but the way that I explain it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7576)|
| 2:06:18| is that we try to work both internally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7578)|
| 2:06:20| to make our own operations more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7580)|
| 2:06:22| efficient and environmentally friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| while also thinking at the community level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7584)|
| 2:06:26| to say how can we help residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| how can we help businesses also make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| these own improvements in their own properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7590)|
| 2:06:32| Among the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7592)|
| 2:06:34| big picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7594)|
| 2:06:36| that I'll talk a few minutes about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7596)|
| 2:06:38| today, one of the things that I'm most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| proud of, we were crunching numbers recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7600)|
| 2:06:42| and I'm happy to report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| we have seen a 25%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| energy use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| intensity reduction since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7608)|
| 2:06:50| that's only between 2010 and 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| Citywide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7612)|
| 2:06:54| That's within our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7614)|
| 2:06:56| municipal buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| That really is a testament both to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7618)|
| 2:07:00| Amoresco improvements that we've invested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7620)|
| 2:07:02| several years ago as well as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7622)|
| 2:07:04| ongoing attention that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| we as Sustainability try to work with facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| but the good work that our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7628)|
| 2:07:10| is doing throughout city buildings to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7630)|
| 2:07:12| we are retaining those savings and delivering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7632)|
| 2:07:14| those cost improvements to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| Another, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7636)|
| 2:07:18| big achievement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7638)|
| 2:07:20| for the community in the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7640)|
| 2:07:22| was attracting the $15 million from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| TVA for the Knoxville Extreme Energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7644)|
| 2:07:26| Makeover Program or KEEM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| Hopefully you've had several residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| who maybe in your neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| have received these upgrades or are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7652)|
| 2:07:34| actually approaching about 600 homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7654)|
| 2:07:36| that have either been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| completed a retrofit or the retrofit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| is actively underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| The CAC has been a fantastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7662)|
| 2:07:44| leader of that. They are plowing through those homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7664)|
| 2:07:46| and I can say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7666)|
| 2:07:48| that at the regional scale Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| is getting a lot of really positive attention from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7670)|
| 2:07:52| TVA as well as the utility industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7672)|
| 2:07:54| as a whole for the innovation that we've been showing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| through that program. So I'm very excited about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7676)|
| 2:07:58| that. Our total budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| for this year I think came in at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| $311,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| just to give you a little bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| detail on that. More than 80% of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| is wrapped up within salaries and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| benefits as well as our ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| contractual obligations with Amoresco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7692)|
| 2:08:14| We're lean, we're green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7694)|
| 2:08:16| as I like to say. It's myself and Brian Blockman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7696)|
| 2:08:18| as well as we are very grateful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7698)|
| 2:08:20| for our AmeriCorps that you have funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7700)|
| 2:08:22| and Lauren| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7702)|
| 2:08:24| has been working with us over the last year. We'll have a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7704)|
| 2:08:26| one in the fall and they provide a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| tremendous amount of additional support for Brian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| and I as we try to keep on top of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7710)|
| 2:08:32| everything we've got going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7712)|
| 2:08:34| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7714)|
| 2:08:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7716)|
| 2:08:38| I saw and I don't know where it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7718)|
| 2:08:40| in this document now that I have in front of me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7720)|
| 2:08:42| there was an increase in the grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7722)|
| 2:08:44| to SEED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7724)|
| 2:08:46| Are they the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7726)|
| 2:08:48| ones that are helping you sign up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7728)|
| 2:08:50| folks for the TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| insulation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7732)|
| 2:08:54| energy efficiency work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7734)|
| 2:08:56| Does that come under your department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7736)|
| 2:08:58| in terms of administration? That grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7738)|
| 2:09:00| in particular does not. That's a community agency grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7740)|
| 2:09:02| I will say though that SEED has been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7742)|
| 2:09:04| fantastic partner to the sustainability office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7744)|
| 2:09:06| and that we have worked with them as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| helping them work with the CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7748)|
| 2:09:10| through KEEM to support that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| Jim, where is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| If you look on page 45| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7754)|
| 2:09:20| you'll see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7760)|
| 2:09:22| $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7762)|
| 2:09:24| that is proposed for SEED| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7764)|
| 2:09:28| and again last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| year that's under agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7772)|
| 2:09:34| it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7774)|
| 2:09:36| maybe what an inch or so down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7776)|
| 2:09:39| they're in alphabetical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=7779)|

| 2:16:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| I was just wondering I know we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| have big flat landmasses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8204)|
| 2:16:46| to market but how are we doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| in chasing suppliers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8208)|
| 2:16:50| to the automobile business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8210)|

| 2:16:54| growth area in Tennessee. I was just curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| whether Knoxville is getting some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8216)|
| 2:16:58| of that growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8218)|
| 2:17:00| We've seen probably as much growth Nick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8220)|
| 2:17:02| as in our existing industries. We have a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8222)|
| 2:17:04| of tier two automotive suppliers here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| in our area. We've seen several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8226)|
| 2:17:08| new companies come along. One of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8228)|

| 2:17:18| to have success with companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8238)|
| 2:17:20| like XE that continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8240)|

| 2:17:26| us. One of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8246)|
| 2:17:28| the areas that we're seeing a lot of activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8248)|
| 2:17:30| currently and we think this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8250)|
| 2:17:32| is a real future and potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| is in the advanced manufacturing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8254)|

| 2:17:54| going to happen in the next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8274)|
| 2:17:56| or is that further out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| The process is underway. The design plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| are working through that right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8280)|
| 2:18:02| now. Obviously Mayor Burchett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8282)|
| 2:18:04| stepped up and took the lead on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8284)|
| 2:18:06| this year and my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8286)|
| 2:18:08| answer to you would be yes, it's definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8288)|
| 2:18:10| going to happen. We also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8290)|

| 2:18:24| that's another opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8304)|
| 2:18:26| for us as far as a large industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8306)|

| 2:18:36| Knoxville Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| site? In other words, is the Chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8318)|
| 2:18:40| or Innovation Valley engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8320)|
| 2:18:42| in that or are you just in the background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8322)|

| 2:20:16| Do you get involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8416)|
| 2:20:18| with any of these corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8418)|
| 2:20:20| redevelopments? I mean the city is taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8420)|
| 2:20:22| the lead in doing infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| improvements and that kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8424)|
| 2:20:26| but in other words do you help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| solicit businesses to fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8428)|
| 2:20:30| in the blanks or is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8430)|
| 2:20:32| really not part of the function of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8432)|
| 2:20:34| organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8434)|
| 2:20:36| If there's a real estate opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8436)|
| 2:20:38| there then we certainly will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8438)|
| 2:20:40| You know, it just depends on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8440)|
| 2:20:42| They tend not to be large acreage but you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8442)|
| 2:20:44| parcels that might be underdeveloped or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8444)|
| 2:20:46| vacant and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| And doing things and working, like Aaron mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8448)|
| 2:20:50| on the sustainability efforts and stuff like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8450)|
| 2:20:52| that's a really crucial part of what we're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8452)|
| 2:20:54| in some of these areas in redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8454)|
| 2:20:56| so we partner with them like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8456)|
| 2:20:58| And Councilman Della Voca, we do meet with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8458)|
| 2:21:00| regularly. We meet with them every other week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8460)|
| 2:21:02| and probably talk at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8462)|
| 2:21:04| probably more times than Rhonda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8464)|
| 2:21:06| wants to talk per week. But we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| are in constant communication with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8468)|
| 2:21:10| and we do tell them if we have new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8470)|
| 2:21:12| initiatives going on and we communicate about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8472)|
| 2:21:14| what's happening or thoughts or ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8474)|
| 2:21:16| or concepts for redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8476)|
| 2:21:19| So they're definitely a part of the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| and very involved in helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| guide those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8483)|
| 2:21:25| Well I know they gather and put together information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8485)|
| 2:21:27| packets and stuff to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| potential employers or businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| understand what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| the opportunities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| Exactly, they understand those and so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| talk about the real estate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| and the places that might be available for those opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8499)|
| 2:21:43| And just to continue on that with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| Christy, I mean it's, you know, when we sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| together and talk, it's a great opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| for us to look at, you know, the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| the corridors as a whole and what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| going to grow and continue from that growth around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| Sharing any love with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| Swan Bakery on Magnolia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8517)|
| 2:22:01| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8521)|
| 2:22:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8523)|
| 2:22:09| This is really for, I guess, Bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8529)|
| 2:22:11| or maybe Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8531)|
| 2:22:13| It's on the TVA towers. Does that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8533)|
| 2:22:15| represent any opportunity for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8535)|
| 2:22:17| in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8537)|
| 2:22:19| that was in the news recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8539)|
| 2:22:21| about their plans to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8541)|
| 2:22:23| vacate those buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8543)|
| 2:22:25| Yes, definitely. Christy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8545)|
| 2:22:27| and I both were on a conference call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| about ten days ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| and we're going to be involved regularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8551)|
| 2:22:33| as that transitions. They've got a real estate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8553)|
| 2:22:35| firm helping them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| market those and we're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| in conversations, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| as to what the use is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8561)|
| 2:22:43| and do all we can to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| it's in the city's interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8565)|
| 2:22:47| They're open to various proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8567)|
| 2:22:49| from mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8569)|
| 2:22:51| They're not certain they can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8571)|
| 2:22:53| all office but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8573)|
| 2:22:55| we'll see what comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8575)|
| 2:22:57| and there are all kinds of possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8577)|
| 2:22:59| with even the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8579)|
| 2:23:01| and how it faces Market Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8581)|
| 2:23:03| and everything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8583)|
| 2:23:05| I'm really pleased to say we had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8585)|
| 2:23:07| positive conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8587)|
| 2:23:09| and we'll be in that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8589)|
| 2:23:11| as we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| with the transition from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8593)|
| 2:23:15| ownership by TVA into whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8595)|
| 2:23:17| happens next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8597)|
| 2:23:19| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8599)|
| 2:23:21| Bill, while you're up there, you want to just brief us on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| the state Supreme Court site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8603)|
| 2:23:25| Right, we're getting, we're very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8605)|
| 2:23:27| close to putting out an RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| so that should be happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8611)|
| 2:23:33| in the next few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| weeks I would think. We'll give you more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| information as that happens. We've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| through a number of iterations on that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8619)|
| 2:23:41| as many of you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| The economy probably safely killed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8623)|
| 2:23:45| one of them and others just didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8625)|
| 2:23:47| work out even though we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| committed to public involvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| in it because when you're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8631)|
| 2:23:53| about a critical site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| with whatever public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| with the interest in the convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8637)|
| 2:23:59| center, with downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| with addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| streets appropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8643)|
| 2:24:05| all the factors that we have heard and we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| we want to make sure are part of that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8647)|
| 2:24:09| we think we're very close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8649)|
| 2:24:11| but yes, we're about to move, about to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| become very active on that very shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8657)|
| 2:24:19| Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| Ready for Charles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| The law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| Mr. Law Director, if you'll come to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8665)|
| 2:24:27| podium please, Charles Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8667)|
| 2:24:29| This is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| on page 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8671)|
| 2:24:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8673)|
| 2:24:35| Page 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8675)|
| 2:24:37| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8677)|
| 2:24:39| I'm Charles Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8679)|
| 2:24:41| I'm honored to represent the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8681)|
| 2:24:43| department and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8683)|
| 2:24:45| our budget stays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| pretty much the same from year to year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| as it has again this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| If you have questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8691)|
| 2:24:53| about what's in our same old budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8693)|
| 2:24:55| then I'd be glad to answer them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| but while you're thinking about what those questions are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8697)|
| 2:24:59| let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8699)|
| 2:25:01| tell you a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8701)|
| 2:25:03| one of our lawyers that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| particularly proud of to have up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| and that's Allison Dyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| and you don't hardly ever see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| Allison Dyer except at beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| meetings and so what you may think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8713)|
| 2:25:15| is that her primary responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8715)|
| 2:25:17| is to handle the beer board meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8717)|
| 2:25:19| and beer board issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8719)|
| 2:25:21| and disciplinary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| actions related to the beer board but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| just a very small part of Allison's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| practice. She represents the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| fire department on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| daily basis. You'd be surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8731)|
| 2:25:33| at how many contracts there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8733)|
| 2:25:35| necessary in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| operate our fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8737)|
| 2:25:39| department. You'd be surprised at how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8739)|
| 2:25:41| employee issues, labor and employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| issues that come up as a result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8743)|
| 2:25:45| of having to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8745)|
| 2:25:47| handle legal issues for the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8747)|
| 2:25:49| She is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| in charge of handling our South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8751)|
| 2:25:53| redevelopment issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8753)|
| 2:25:55| down there and she does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| a great job with that as well and there's a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8757)|
| 2:25:59| of contractual issues and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8759)|
| 2:26:01| things associated with building the new park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8761)|
| 2:26:03| over there and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8763)|
| 2:26:05| South Knoxville development issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8765)|
| 2:26:07| and on top of all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8767)|
| 2:26:09| she is the lawyer in the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8769)|
| 2:26:11| department who is responsible for major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8771)|
| 2:26:13| contracts. So if we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| just a huge contract that's sort of out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| of the ordinary, Allison is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| the first go-to person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8779)|
| 2:26:21| that we look to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| prepare the language that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8783)|
| 2:26:25| in our major contracts. For example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| all of this redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| where the old Baptist hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8789)|
| 2:26:31| site was that you probably heard something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| about already this morning. Allison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| has been very much involved in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| contractual negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| associated with that. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| I just wanted you to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| how much and how busy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| these lawyers are up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| We have seven and a half lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| in the law department. I only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| count as a half because I used to be a lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| back when I represented you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| but these days I am a professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| attender of meetings rather than a real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| lawyer. So I count at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| for a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| So I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8823)|
| 2:27:05| proud of the work that they do up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| there and how much work they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| and how efficiently they do the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| and how competently they do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| It just astounds me to see how well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| they do. So I like to tell you about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| when I get the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| Now, are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| Mr. Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8841)|
| 2:27:24| Mr. Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| How are we doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| on reducing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| any backlog of back taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8850)|
| 2:27:32| I know that we have a full-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8852)|
| 2:27:34| lawyer down there doing a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8854)|
| 2:27:36| but how are we doing on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| Doug Gordon is working on that. You're always going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8858)|
| 2:27:40| some backlog of back taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8860)|
| 2:27:42| but it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8862)|
| 2:27:44| slowly and surely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8864)|
| 2:27:46| coming down. It's headed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8866)|
| 2:27:48| the right direction. Probably Jim can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8868)|
| 2:27:50| tell us, give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8870)|
| 2:27:52| more exact figures than I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8872)|
| 2:27:54| but Doug does a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8874)|
| 2:27:56| great job of making sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8876)|
| 2:27:58| when folks unfortunately go bankrupt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8878)|
| 2:28:00| he files the necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8880)|
| 2:28:02| claims over in the bankruptcy court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8882)|
| 2:28:04| and he makes sure that we follow up on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| and he's very diligent about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| collecting our taxes. He's also been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| diligent not only in collecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8890)|
| 2:28:12| property taxes but also in collecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8892)|
| 2:28:14| personal property taxes and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| other taxes and fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8896)|
| 2:28:18| that the city requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8898)|
| 2:28:20| Does he get involved with blighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8900)|
| 2:28:22| properties and trying to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8902)|
| 2:28:24| those in a tax sale or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8904)|
| 2:28:26| cleaned up somehow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8906)|
| 2:28:28| He regulates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| the tax sale. Jim, you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8910)|
| 2:28:32| to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| We have policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8914)|
| 2:28:36| on what we put in tax sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8916)|
| 2:28:38| We cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8918)|
| 2:28:40| direct or target| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8920)|
| 2:28:42| specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8922)|
| 2:28:44| properties because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8924)|
| 2:28:46| we want them to fall under our criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| I don't want to say you're penalizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8928)|
| 2:28:50| a person for a variety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8930)|
| 2:28:52| of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8932)|
| 2:28:54| It has to be at least three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| in arrears? It has to be three. That's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8936)|
| 2:28:58| minimum threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8938)|
| 2:29:00| We obviously can't get everybody in the sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| but we try and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8942)|
| 2:29:04| be very objective about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| properties. We do put in tax sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8946)|
| 2:29:08| so again we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| be accused of targeting somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| for political purposes or other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8952)|
| 2:29:14| reasons and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8954)|
| 2:29:16| are very careful to that. What we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8956)|
| 2:29:18| seen and again we keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8958)|
| 2:29:20| creeping up on what we're doing in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8960)|
| 2:29:22| initial years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8962)|
| 2:29:24| I will say that again Doug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8964)|
| 2:29:26| and the rest of the staff down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| we've done pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8968)|
| 2:29:30| We used Doug on hotel-motel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| tax last year and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| probably cranked in an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8974)|
| 2:29:36| $180,000 in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8976)|
| 2:29:38| back hotel-motel taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8978)|
| 2:29:40| this current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8980)|
| 2:29:42| So we've kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8982)|
| 2:29:44| expanded the scope. Now sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8984)|
| 2:29:46| he may not like it or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8986)|
| 2:29:48| we may not like it but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8988)|
| 2:29:50| again we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| really focus on those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8992)|
| 2:29:54| that become delinquent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8994)|
| 2:29:56| because delinquencies penalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8996)|
| 2:29:58| the rest of the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=8998)|
| 2:30:00| and it's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9000)|
| 2:30:02| not fair to the people that do pay their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9002)|
| 2:30:04| taxes on time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9004)|
| 2:30:06| to have people delinquent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9006)|
| 2:30:08| But again I've been very pleased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9008)|
| 2:30:10| with what we're doing in terms of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9010)|
| 2:30:12| and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9012)|
| 2:30:14| it may take us a while but typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| we're going to get about 99| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| plus percent of all the taxes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9018)|
| 2:30:20| are ever levied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9020)|
| 2:30:22| and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9022)|
| 2:30:24| Some people seem to want to game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9024)|
| 2:30:26| the system by just coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9026)|
| 2:30:28| the third or fourth year and paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9028)|
| 2:30:30| one year's taxes and slipping off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9030)|
| 2:30:32| the list. Is there any answer to any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9032)|
| 2:30:34| We, well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9034)|
| 2:30:36| the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9036)|
| 2:30:38| remedy would be at the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9038)|
| 2:30:40| and again we keep trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| but as you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9042)|
| 2:30:44| there's a kind of reluctance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9044)|
| 2:30:46| at the state, at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9046)|
| 2:30:48| at some levels of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9048)|
| 2:30:50| to assist us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9050)|
| 2:30:52| in doing that. What we would really like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9052)|
| 2:30:54| is if you go delinquent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9054)|
| 2:30:56| and we put you in a tax sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9056)|
| 2:30:58| we believe that you should make up all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9058)|
| 2:31:00| of your taxes and not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9060)|
| 2:31:02| enough to buy you out of the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9062)|
| 2:31:04| The other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9064)|
| 2:31:06| thing that we have done again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9066)|
| 2:31:08| and we continue to do this, I'm pleased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9068)|
| 2:31:10| that we work with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9070)|
| 2:31:12| we tend to stagger sales so that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| you know, to try and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9074)|
| 2:31:16| help people from gaming the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9076)|
| 2:31:18| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9078)|
| 2:31:20| if you try and buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9080)|
| 2:31:22| out of ours you may get caught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9082)|
| 2:31:24| in the county's tax sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9084)|
| 2:31:26| six months later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9086)|
| 2:31:28| and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9088)|
| 2:31:30| our practice is if you're delinquent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9090)|
| 2:31:32| on sales tax, I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9092)|
| 2:31:34| property taxes in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9094)|
| 2:31:36| or the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9096)|
| 2:31:38| you can't buy out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9098)|
| 2:31:40| you have to buy out of both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9100)|
| 2:31:42| in order to get out of the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9102)|
| 2:31:44| You cannot play one against the others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9104)|
| 2:31:46| Let me point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9106)|
| 2:31:48| that's a really foolish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9108)|
| 2:31:50| economic game to play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9110)|
| 2:31:52| because it's really expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9112)|
| 2:31:54| because of the interest rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9114)|
| 2:31:56| that we're authorized to charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9116)|
| 2:31:58| and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9118)|
| 2:32:00| if somebody's trying to game the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9120)|
| 2:32:02| in that direction they're gaming themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9122)|
| 2:32:04| out of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9124)|
| 2:32:06| a really foolish thing to do economically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9126)|
| 2:32:08| but people try to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9128)|
| 2:32:10| How much is owed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9130)|
| 2:32:12| How much is owed in back taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9132)|
| 2:32:14| I don't know Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9134)|
| 2:32:16| I don't know off the top of my head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9136)|
| 2:32:18| several million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9138)|
| 2:32:20| we're going to collect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9140)|
| 2:32:22| it's going to take us a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9142)|
| 2:32:24| but again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9144)|
| 2:32:26| if you just want to look at our revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9146)|
| 2:32:28| what we collect in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9148)|
| 2:32:30| delinquent taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9150)|
| 2:32:32| on just real property loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9152)|
| 2:32:34| is around three million dollars a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9154)|
| 2:32:36| and that's our revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9156)|
| 2:32:38| to the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9158)|
| 2:32:40| we prefer obviously to get it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9160)|
| 2:32:42| in the first year so we don't have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9162)|
| 2:32:44| focus on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9164)|
| 2:32:46| the unfortunate reality is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9166)|
| 2:32:48| we won't get 100%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9168)|
| 2:32:50| but again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9170)|
| 2:32:52| we're getting about three million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9172)|
| 2:32:54| a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9174)|
| 2:32:56| just delinquent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9176)|
| 2:32:58| real property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9178)|
| 2:33:01| money in delinquent personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9181)|
| 2:33:03| and a little bit in delinquent public utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9183)|
| 2:33:05| there's not as much there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9185)|
| 2:33:07| Marshall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9187)|
| 2:33:09| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9189)|
| 2:33:11| I guess I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| and I think this is your department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| it was a particularly rough year at the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9195)|
| 2:33:17| the loss of the hall revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9197)|
| 2:33:19| and annexation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9199)|
| 2:33:21| and there may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| political forces beyond our control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9203)|
| 2:33:25| but I guess have we thought anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9205)|
| 2:33:27| about redoing or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| rethinking our lobbying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9209)|
| 2:33:31| structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9211)|
| 2:33:33| or our lobbying game plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9213)|
| 2:33:35| it just seems like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9215)|
| 2:33:37| from my perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9217)|
| 2:33:39| that we're just getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9219)|
| 2:33:41| slaughtered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9221)|
| 2:33:43| I have to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9223)|
| 2:33:45| we have a team approach to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9225)|
| 2:33:47| lobbying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9227)|
| 2:33:49| we have Bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9229)|
| 2:33:51| gets involved in lobbying, Christy gets involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9231)|
| 2:33:53| in lobbying, the mayor gets involved in lobbying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| then of course we have Tony Thompson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9235)|
| 2:33:57| who is the lobbyist that we pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9237)|
| 2:33:59| over in Nashville to be involved in our lobbying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9239)|
| 2:34:01| we also have Jane Alvis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9241)|
| 2:34:03| who is the lobbyist for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9243)|
| 2:34:05| the big four cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9245)|
| 2:34:07| and we have a very very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9247)|
| 2:34:09| active lobbying presence and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9249)|
| 2:34:11| a very effective lobbying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9251)|
| 2:34:13| presence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9253)|
| 2:34:15| Let me jump in on that Charles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9255)|
| 2:34:17| I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9257)|
| 2:34:19| there were some failures that we all hated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9259)|
| 2:34:21| to see with legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9261)|
| 2:34:23| I can assure you that everybody made those points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| very strongly but there was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| firmly, there were firm disagreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| among the majority there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9269)|
| 2:34:31| but we were very successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9271)|
| 2:34:33| a number of us went over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9273)|
| 2:34:35| Nashville and got with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9275)|
| 2:34:37| other cities on the de-annexation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9277)|
| 2:34:39| which would have been really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9279)|
| 2:34:41| a very unsatisfactory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| outcome for us and even more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| so from other cities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9285)|
| 2:34:47| that was a very successful effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9287)|
| 2:34:49| and the lobbyists were very heavily involved with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9289)|
| 2:34:51| along with mayors and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9291)|
| 2:34:53| people from all over the state and what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9293)|
| 2:34:55| found from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9295)|
| 2:34:57| and I guess Jesse is not here, he was there too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9297)|
| 2:34:59| he and I were there with Mayor Rojero that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9299)|
| 2:35:01| was the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9301)|
| 2:35:03| to bring mayors to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9303)|
| 2:35:05| hearings on some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9305)|
| 2:35:07| on some of the pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9307)|
| 2:35:09| of legislation did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9309)|
| 2:35:11| have an impact so now we delayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9311)|
| 2:35:13| that bill who knows it may be back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| and sometimes that's all we can do but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| it's very much of a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9317)|
| 2:35:19| and we're all very involved in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9319)|
| 2:35:21| and I think given the context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9321)|
| 2:35:23| where we've had some successes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9323)|
| 2:35:25| which there were more but we're going to keep at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9325)|
| 2:35:27| As Mr. Pavlis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9331)|
| 2:35:33| you can be as effective a lobbyist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9333)|
| 2:35:35| as you can possibly be, you can only be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9335)|
| 2:35:37| as good as the legislature will allow you to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9337)|
| 2:35:39| and frankly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9339)|
| 2:35:41| the mood of the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9341)|
| 2:35:43| is not particularly sympathetic to municipal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9343)|
| 2:35:45| interest at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9345)|
| 2:35:47| That has nothing to do with the lobbying effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9347)|
| 2:35:49| Right, right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9349)|
| 2:35:51| I was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9351)|
| 2:35:53| wondering if we're trying to rethink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9353)|
| 2:35:55| or try a different strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9355)|
| 2:35:57| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9357)|

| 2:36:03| Thank you, I just wanted to echo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9363)|
| 2:36:05| briefly what Charles said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9365)|
| 2:36:07| you know I felt after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9367)|
| 2:36:09| serving on council for a year I was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9369)|
| 2:36:11| overwhelmed with what all the city actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| does, all the different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9373)|
| 2:36:15| the services that it provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9375)|
| 2:36:17| Working with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9377)|
| 2:36:19| I've been overwhelmed with what all they actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9379)|
| 2:36:21| do with not a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9381)|
| 2:36:23| of people, I mean the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9383)|
| 2:36:25| attorneys and the staff there are all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9385)|
| 2:36:27| great people, good to get along with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9387)|
| 2:36:29| they really know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9389)|
| 2:36:31| their areas of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9391)|
| 2:36:33| the law and working with the different entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9393)|
| 2:36:35| that deal with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9395)|
| 2:36:37| and I just wanted council to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9397)|
| 2:36:39| that everyone there is really, really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9399)|
| 2:36:41| good to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9401)|
| 2:36:43| and they do a fine job with not a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9403)|
| 2:36:45| Yeah, if I could just add to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9405)|
| 2:36:47| I have to add kudos, Allison's helped me a ton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9407)|
| 2:36:49| too on the South Waterfront and Regal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9409)|

| 2:36:53| Charles is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9413)|
| 2:36:55| Thank you Mr. Frost, I'll be glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9415)|
| 2:36:57| I'll certainly pass that on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9417)|
| 2:36:59| the folks who do the work up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9419)|
| 2:37:01| Nick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9421)|
| 2:37:03| Yeah, I just want to very briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9423)|
| 2:37:05| weigh in on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9425)|
| 2:37:07| the lobbying team in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9427)|
| 2:37:09| because I am there three to four days a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9429)|
| 2:37:11| every week turn session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9431)|
| 2:37:13| and I will assure you they work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9433)|
| 2:37:15| so tirelessly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9435)|
| 2:37:17| and endlessly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9437)|
| 2:37:19| and I never, never will get involved in the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9439)|
| 2:37:21| business down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9441)|
| 2:37:23| but I can certainly be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9443)|
| 2:37:25| and I do monitor and I do watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9445)|
| 2:37:27| and you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9447)|
| 2:37:29| when things come up I let Madeline know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9449)|
| 2:37:31| or Bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9451)|
| 2:37:33| that our antennas are up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9453)|
| 2:37:35| but a delay is a win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9455)|
| 2:37:37| and we got a big win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9457)|
| 2:37:39| in the annexation part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9459)|
| 2:37:41| but bills that are down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9461)|
| 2:37:43| like the Hall Income Tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9463)|
| 2:37:45| this bill has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9465)|
| 2:37:47| volleyed back and forth for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9467)|
| 2:37:49| and eventually and under the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9469)|
| 2:37:51| makeup of the General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9471)|
| 2:37:55| it just comes a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9475)|
| 2:37:57| when it's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9477)|
| 2:37:59| and they've delayed it for years and years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9479)|
| 2:38:01| and years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9481)|
| 2:38:03| so they really do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9483)|
| 2:38:05| a really good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9485)|
| 2:38:07| Tony, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9487)|
| 2:38:09| I know both of them but I know Tony better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9489)|
| 2:38:11| and he is very respected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9491)|
| 2:38:13| and accepted in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9493)|
| 2:38:15| General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9495)|
| 2:38:17| and really has done a very good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9497)|
| 2:38:19| representing us as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9499)|
| 2:38:21| and then Jane is the big four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9501)|
| 2:38:23| so gosh I'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9503)|
| 2:38:25| I'd be real leery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9505)|
| 2:38:27| just from my perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9507)|
| 2:38:29| of changing that around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9509)|
| 2:38:31| they do a good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9511)|
| 2:38:33| Tarden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9513)|
| 2:38:35| Thank you, Dan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9515)|
| 2:38:37| I want to ask you, I'm just curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9517)|
| 2:38:39| I think I've heard you talk about it before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9519)|
| 2:38:41| but when you hire outside counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9521)|
| 2:38:43| do you just need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9523)|
| 2:38:45| special expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9525)|
| 2:38:47| maybe that your department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9527)|
| 2:38:49| doesn't cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9529)|
| 2:38:51| could you talk about that a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9531)|
| 2:38:53| Yeah, we hire outside counsel in cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9533)|
| 2:38:55| where there may be a conflict of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9535)|
| 2:38:57| and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9537)|
| 2:38:59| civil rights cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9539)|
| 2:39:01| where there is a potential conflict of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9541)|
| 2:39:03| between an individual police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9543)|
| 2:39:06| and the actual city's position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9546)|
| 2:39:08| in a case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| that's mostly where we hire outside counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9550)|
| 2:39:12| on the federal lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9552)|
| 2:39:14| the civil rights lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| in federal court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9556)|
| 2:39:18| and so we hire people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9558)|
| 2:39:20| for that who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9560)|
| 2:39:22| a great deal of expertise in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9562)|
| 2:39:24| who have been doing it for a bunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9564)|
| 2:39:26| of years and have been very successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9566)|
| 2:39:28| on behalf of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9568)|
| 2:39:30| in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9570)|
| 2:39:32| we hire very little outside counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9572)|
| 2:39:34| beyond that, but when we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9574)|
| 2:39:36| we hire them based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9576)|
| 2:39:38| based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9578)|
| 2:39:40| what their experience is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9580)|
| 2:39:42| and what their particular expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9582)|
| 2:39:44| is in the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9584)|
| 2:39:46| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9586)|

| 2:39:54| and what a pleasure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9594)|
| 2:39:56| but also just her expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9596)|
| 2:39:58| in the whole signed ordinance situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9598)|
| 2:40:00| was really extremely beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9600)|
| 2:40:02| and just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9602)|
| 2:40:04| say thanks again for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9604)|

| 2:40:08| I really think Krista| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9608)|
| 2:40:10| is a fabulous addition to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9610)|
| 2:40:12| law department, but right now she's gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9612)|
| 2:40:14| on vacation so I'm mad at her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9614)|
| 2:40:16| I don't see anything else good about her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9616)|
| 2:40:18| She got food trucks taken care of before she left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9618)|
| 2:40:20| She's earned that vacation this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| That's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9622)|
| 2:40:24| Any other questions from counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9624)|

| 2:41:38| as Charles said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9698)|
| 2:41:40| she's the attorney for the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9700)|
| 2:41:42| and she's been in that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9702)|
| 2:41:44| ever since I've been chief and before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9704)|
| 2:41:46| and she's been a great adviser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| to me. Anytime there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| even a hint of a legal question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9710)|
| 2:41:52| I get on the phone and give her a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9712)|
| 2:41:54| and if she doesn't know the answer and she doesn't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9714)|
| 2:41:56| she knows where to find it and does the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9716)|
| 2:41:58| necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9718)|
| 2:42:00| I'll jump on that bandwagon too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9720)|
| 2:42:02| she really has been very beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9722)|
| 2:42:04| for the fire department and therefore for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9724)|

| 2:42:14| questions as we go along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9734)|
| 2:42:16| I'd like to talk a few minutes at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9736)|
| 2:42:18| about some of our capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9738)|
| 2:42:20| requests and kind of describe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9740)|

| 2:42:30| $44.6 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9750)|
| 2:42:32| that's an increase of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9752)|
| 2:42:34| 3.3 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9754)|
| 2:42:36| or 1.4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9756)|
| 2:42:38| over this year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9758)|
| 2:42:40| a very small amount of that increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9760)|
| 2:42:42| is for increased cost of supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| that category includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9764)|

| 2:43:00| increase is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9780)|
| 2:43:02| increases in personal services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9782)|
| 2:43:04| that's basically salaries and benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9784)|
| 2:43:06| and that category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9786)|
| 2:43:08| accounts for 69 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9788)|
| 2:43:10| of our overall budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9790)|
| 2:43:12| most of the remaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9792)|
| 2:43:14| increase in the budget is due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9794)|
| 2:43:16| higher risk management costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9796)|

| 2:43:28| costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9808)|
| 2:43:30| if you all recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9810)|
| 2:43:32| last year we installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9812)|
| 2:43:34| computers or mobile data terminals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9814)|
| 2:43:36| on all of our firetrucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9816)|
| 2:43:38| that finally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9818)|
| 2:43:40| brought us into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9820)|
| 2:43:42| computer age as far as the firetrucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9824)|
| 2:43:46| those provide improved information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9826)|
| 2:43:48| to all our firefighters in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9828)|
| 2:43:50| but there are some ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9830)|
| 2:43:52| costs associated with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9832)|
| 2:43:54| it's mostly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9834)|
| 2:43:56| associated with the link| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9836)|

| 2:44:00| the computer in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9840)|
| 2:44:06| are there any questions so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9846)|
| 2:44:08| about the operating budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9848)|
| 2:44:10| I'd like to go over some of the capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9850)|
| 2:44:12| requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9852)|
| 2:44:14| alright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9854)|

| 2:44:18| chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9858)|
| 2:44:20| I remember you telling us that you had a fairly large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9860)|
| 2:44:22| class of trainees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9862)|
| 2:44:24| do you plan to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9864)|
| 2:44:26| larger number at the end of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9866)|
| 2:44:28| in the fire department than we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9868)|
| 2:44:30| at the beginning of the year now that we're starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9870)|
| 2:44:32| no we've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9872)|
| 2:44:34| graduated that class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9874)|
| 2:44:36| at the end of this last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9876)|
| 2:44:38| year and it brought us to full staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9878)|
| 2:44:40| we've already had some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9880)|
| 2:44:42| retirements since then so we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9882)|
| 2:44:44| down about 4 or 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9884)|
| 2:44:46| at the moment and we actually planned ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9886)|
| 2:44:48| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9888)|
| 2:44:50| requisitioned some extra ones so that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9890)|
| 2:44:52| have some in case some didn't make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9892)|
| 2:44:54| through we had one who didn't make it through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9894)|
| 2:44:56| but all the rest of them did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9896)|
| 2:44:58| but as of right now we're down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9898)|
| 2:45:00| I think it's 5 as of right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9900)|
| 2:45:02| due to just retirements over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9902)|
| 2:45:04| few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9904)|
| 2:45:06| yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9906)|
| 2:45:08| what's the normal age of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9908)|
| 2:45:11| retirement? Is it the 55ish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9911)|
| 2:45:13| years? No generally it's older| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9913)|
| 2:45:15| than that although you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9915)|
| 2:45:17| retire with 25 years and 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9917)|
| 2:45:19| years of age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| but most people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| work until the 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9923)|
| 2:45:25| years and so it's more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9925)|
| 2:45:27| like it seems like the common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9927)|
| 2:45:29| is around 60 or 62| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9929)|
| 2:45:31| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9931)|
| 2:45:33| one of the reasons is that way they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9933)|
| 2:45:35| start drawing social security benefits at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9935)|
| 2:45:37| point so most of them that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9937)|
| 2:45:39| are 50 or even 55| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9939)|
| 2:45:41| retire at that age they retire a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9941)|
| 2:45:43| bit beyond that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| we do have 10 that are on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9945)|
| 2:45:47| drop plan right now so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9947)|
| 2:45:49| as far as we know we have 10 that will be retiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9949)|
| 2:45:51| within the next 2 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9951)|
| 2:45:55| alright thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9955)|
| 2:45:57| and we'll be planning accordingly obviously we're down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9957)|
| 2:45:59| 5 we've got 10 leaving in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9959)|
| 2:46:01| 2 years so we'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9961)|
| 2:46:03| gearing up for another academy within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9963)|
| 2:46:05| the next year so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9965)|
| 2:46:07| does it lower your costs any as people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9967)|
| 2:46:09| rotate out? Yes it does because of the lower cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9969)|
| 2:46:11| of the starting levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9971)|
| 2:46:13| you start at what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9973)|
| 2:46:15| 315 or something like that? That's about right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9975)|
| 2:46:17| yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| I know there's a lot of talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9979)|
| 2:46:21| or at least in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9981)|
| 2:46:23| I always hear minority recruitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9983)|
| 2:46:25| at KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9985)|
| 2:46:27| do you all jointly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9987)|
| 2:46:29| or what is your plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9989)|
| 2:46:31| for minority recruiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9991)|
| 2:46:33| We do have several things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9993)|
| 2:46:35| that we have been working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9995)|
| 2:46:37| on and we have some new ideas that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9997)|
| 2:46:39| just starting to work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9999)|
| 2:46:41| we in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10001)|

| 2:47:09| East High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10029)|
| 2:47:11| amongst some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10031)|
| 2:47:13| things so yeah we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10033)|
| 2:47:15| actively recruiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10035)|
| 2:47:17| and we are about to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10037)|
| 2:47:19| try and borrow some of the ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10039)|
| 2:47:21| from Fred Kimber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10041)|
| 2:47:23| also and work with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10043)|
| 2:47:27| I guess I've got one more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10047)|
| 2:47:29| since we're not on the capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10049)|
| 2:47:31| budget part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10051)|
| 2:47:33| on the operational cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10053)|
| 2:47:35| we learned this morning that the city has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| about 1.8 million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10057)|
| 2:47:39| in longevity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10059)|
| 2:47:41| expenses each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10061)|
| 2:47:43| and I know that police and fire have the bulk of the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10063)|
| 2:47:45| how do you see that being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10065)|
| 2:47:47| in your department in other words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10067)|
| 2:47:49| we have this classification system where you move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10069)|
| 2:47:51| through the different grades and steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| how do you use the longevity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10073)|
| 2:47:55| pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10075)|
| 2:47:57| to supplement your system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10077)|
| 2:48:01| I'm not quite sure I understand your question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| Nick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10083)|
| 2:48:05| what's the function in the organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10085)|
| 2:48:07| in other words you can move a person up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10087)|
| 2:48:09| by steps or by changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10089)|
| 2:48:11| their title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10091)|
| 2:48:13| or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10093)|
| 2:48:15| and the longevity is simply based on your years of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10095)|
| 2:48:17| that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10097)|
| 2:48:19| longevity pay that we receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10099)|
| 2:48:21| is it a recruiting tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10101)|
| 2:48:23| how do you use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10103)|
| 2:48:25| I see what you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10105)|
| 2:48:27| that along with a lot of other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10107)|
| 2:48:29| one of the tools that we can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10109)|
| 2:48:31| not so much recruiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10111)|
| 2:48:33| but retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10113)|
| 2:48:35| because each year you keep getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10115)|
| 2:48:37| a greater longevity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10117)|
| 2:48:39| pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10119)|
| 2:48:41| an increased longevity pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10121)|
| 2:48:43| so that is one of the tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10123)|
| 2:48:45| we can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10125)|
| 2:48:47| as is the pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10127)|
| 2:48:49| to help retain good employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10129)|
| 2:48:51| from Jim York| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10131)|
| 2:48:53| does that increase the base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10133)|
| 2:48:55| for the pension cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10135)|
| 2:48:57| you keep growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10137)|
| 2:48:59| the base that you apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10139)|
| 2:49:01| whatever formulas you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10141)|
| 2:49:03| pension is covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10143)|
| 2:49:05| on your base salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10145)|
| 2:49:07| plus longevity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10147)|
| 2:49:09| those two get added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10149)|
| 2:49:11| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10151)|
| 2:49:13| we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10153)|
| 2:49:15| very good in our pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10155)|
| 2:49:17| I know everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10157)|
| 2:49:19| hears about pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10159)|
| 2:49:21| and how people try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10161)|
| 2:49:23| and manipulate the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10163)|
| 2:49:25| overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10165)|
| 2:49:27| and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10167)|
| 2:49:29| but we've been very good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10169)|
| 2:49:31| at controlling that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10171)|
| 2:49:33| and there are very few things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10173)|
| 2:49:35| that are used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10175)|
| 2:49:37| that pension is calculated on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10177)|
| 2:49:39| base salary plus longevity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10179)|
| 2:49:41| so that you're prevented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10181)|
| 2:49:43| from gaining it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10183)|
| 2:49:45| that's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10185)|
| 2:49:47| there was one other question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10187)|
| 2:49:49| for the chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10189)|
| 2:49:51| one of the entries under the firefighting division says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10191)|
| 2:49:53| if you're out of fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10193)|
| 2:49:55| you probably can't leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10195)|
| 2:49:57| is there any way to control those costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10197)|
| 2:49:59| there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10199)|
| 2:50:01| but Jim always likes to chime in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10201)|
| 2:50:03| there's some built in costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10203)|
| 2:50:05| that can't be avoided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10205)|
| 2:50:07| due to FLSA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10207)|
| 2:50:09| requirements for the fire service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10209)|
| 2:50:11| I don't know Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10211)|
| 2:50:13| if you want to talk about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10213)|
| 2:50:15| and again this is kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10215)|
| 2:50:17| maybe exotic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10217)|
| 2:50:19| but it was a big number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10219)|
| 2:50:21| if you work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10221)|
| 2:50:23| under FLSA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10223)|
| 2:50:25| if you work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10225)|
| 2:50:27| more than 212| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10227)|
| 2:50:29| I think it's 212 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10229)|
| 2:50:31| in a 28 day cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10231)|
| 2:50:33| you must be paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10233)|
| 2:50:35| overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10235)|
| 2:50:37| the way the fire department schedule works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10237)|
| 2:50:39| you're either going to work 216| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10239)|
| 2:50:41| in a 28 day cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10241)|
| 2:50:43| or 240 hours in a cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10243)|
| 2:50:45| so you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10245)|
| 2:50:47| if you just show up for work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10247)|
| 2:50:49| overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10249)|
| 2:50:51| just because you exceed that 212 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10251)|
| 2:50:53| in that 28 day period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10253)|
| 2:50:55| we have to provide you overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10255)|
| 2:50:57| so you talk about the 600,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10257)|
| 2:50:59| probably most of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10259)|
| 2:51:01| is actually just in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10261)|
| 2:51:03| overtime that comes naturally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10263)|
| 2:51:05| because they work their shifts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10265)|
| 2:51:07| they work their shifts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10267)|
| 2:51:09| and federal law says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10269)|
| 2:51:11| after a certain number of hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10271)|
| 2:51:13| you have to kick in time and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10273)|
| 2:51:15| and then there's other types of overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10275)|
| 2:51:17| you know has to work two shifts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10277)|
| 2:51:19| or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10279)|
| 2:51:21| I would say that probably the bulk of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10281)|
| 2:51:23| overtime is just that natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10283)|
| 2:51:25| piece that just falls based on when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10285)|
| 2:51:27| your shift hits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10287)|
| 2:51:29| Dan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10289)|
| 2:51:31| Chief I wanted to ask you about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10291)|
| 2:51:33| under the arson investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10293)|
| 2:51:35| there was several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10295)|
| 2:51:37| fires set recently at Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10297)|
| 2:51:39| College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10299)|
| 2:51:41| how's that investigation going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10301)|
| 2:51:43| without going into too much details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10303)|
| 2:51:46| they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10306)|
| 2:51:48| still following leads on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10308)|
| 2:51:50| it has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10310)|
| 2:51:52| in the media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10312)|
| 2:51:54| they think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10314)|
| 2:51:56| just kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10316)|
| 2:51:58| that are doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10318)|
| 2:52:00| just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10320)|
