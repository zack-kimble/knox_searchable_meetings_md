| 2:52:19| so my support of modifications of this has nothing to do with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10339)|
| 2:52:23| but I do think that there's improvements with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10343)|
| 2:52:26| To the actual item before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10346)|
| 2:52:30| I don't quite understand, Mr. Marlow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10350)|
| 2:52:35| what the recommendation is for the modification to table 12-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10355)|
| 2:52:44| Could you clarify on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10364)|
| 2:52:47| I'd have to see table 12-2 to refresh my recollection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10367)|
| 2:52:50| but I'm thinking this is arising out of a rezone request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10370)|
| 2:52:55| that I brought forward last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10375)|
| 2:52:58| 50-foot deep lot, 148 feet long or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10378)|
| 2:53:02| that I wanted CN and got CN| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10382)|
| 2:53:05| for the purposes of being able to do seven townhomes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10385)|
| 2:53:08| This buffer yard, I'll have to get a VZA variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10388)|
| 2:53:11| because simply to get the depth of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10391)|
| 2:53:14| with the 50 feet and the 20-foot buffer zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10394)|
| 2:53:17| like you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10397)|
| 2:53:19| and I don't think I can put a driveway in that buffer zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10399)|
| 2:53:21| creates a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10401)|
| 2:53:23| In my case, I'm envisioning grade change, retaining wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10403)|
| 2:53:26| and then put a solid fence above it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10406)|
| 2:53:28| and the 30% as allowed now seems somewhat arbitrary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10408)|
| 2:53:32| and doesn't allow much more use of the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10412)|
| 2:53:35| I just picked 70. I can come down on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10415)|
| 2:53:38| And then kind of the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10418)|
| 2:53:42| if you're using CN to use townhomes to up density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10422)|
| 2:53:47| why do we even need the buffer yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10427)|
| 2:53:50| when it's residential versus residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10430)|
| 2:53:53| There it's kind of a driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10433)|
| 2:53:55| just like your neighbor could have a driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10435)|
| 2:53:57| at a zero lot line if it's R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10437)|
| 2:54:00| Why does the rule change if the driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10440)|
| 2:54:02| is serving a CN zone piece of paper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10442)|
| 2:54:05| I mean, a CN zone parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10445)|
| 2:54:08| because to me that's nothing more than a color on a map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10448)|
| 2:54:11| like the practical effect is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10451)|
| 2:54:13| we've got a building that people live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10453)|
| 2:54:15| I think that this whole issue surrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10455)|
| 2:54:17| and we need to prioritize people living in houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10457)|
| 2:54:20| not in travel trailers, vans, and under bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10460)|
| 2:54:25| So I don't believe that this is in the scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10465)|
| 2:54:31| of what city council recently requested to be reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10471)|
| 2:54:38| and so I do think that pushing this into a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10478)|
| 2:54:43| that would have us taking a closer look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10483)|
| 2:54:47| would be very beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10487)|
| 2:54:49| So I'll let someone else speak for a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10489)|
| 2:54:54| but I do think that I would like to send this to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10494)|
| 2:54:59| I think that I would want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10499)|
| 2:55:01| some modifications to it beforehand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| but I would also like to hear what other commissioners have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10503)|
| 2:55:07| Commissioner Schill, so I agree that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10507)|
| 2:55:13| when it's residential next to residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10513)|
| 2:55:16| it makes sense to have lower buffer yards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10516)|
| 2:55:18| but the way that this is currently written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10518)|
| 2:55:20| it seems that this would apply to if commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10520)|
| 2:55:22| were next to residentials, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10522)|
| 2:55:25| And so I did not spend the time to write up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10525)|
| 2:55:28| an alternative code for this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10528)|
| 2:55:32| Maybe since you know so much about it, Logan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10532)|
| 2:55:35| if we postponed it, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10535)|
| 2:55:38| So I would like to have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10538)|
| 2:55:42| Yeah, I would make a motion to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10542)|
| 2:55:48| We've got a motion to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10548)|
| 2:55:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10551)|
| 2:55:52| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10552)|
| 2:55:53| Okay, so motion by Commissioner Schill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10553)|
| 2:55:56| so seconded by Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10556)|
| 2:56:00| Seeing no other likes, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10560)|
| 2:56:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10563)|
| 2:56:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10564)|
| 2:56:06| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10566)|
| 2:56:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10567)|
| 2:56:10| Let's take a 10, 12-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10570)|
| 2:56:17| Here for the applicant, Timothy Neal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10577)|
| 2:56:24| Do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10584)|
| 2:56:26| We do have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10586)|
| 2:56:27| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10587)|
| 2:56:29| I'll defer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10589)|
| 2:56:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10590)|
| 2:56:31| Okay, would the opposition like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10591)|
| 2:56:44| Hello, my name is Wendell Chittum, address is 117 Neals Landing Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10604)|
| 2:56:50| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10610)|
| 2:56:54| I oppose this today because my property is being flooded now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10614)|
| 2:57:02| The new development, as you can scan up, 203, right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10622)|
| 2:57:11| 203 all the way up to 227, 243.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10631)|
| 2:57:16| In that range right there, all of that land right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10636)|
| 2:57:19| the grade was raised 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10639)|
| 2:57:23| Took dirt from the left side of the creek, put it to the right side of the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10643)|
| 2:57:27| That was a flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10647)|
| 2:57:29| Nobody really realized that, but it was a flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10649)|
| 2:57:32| That being said, once that happened, all the water that used to go there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10652)|
| 2:57:37| backed up into my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10657)|
| 2:57:40| So as of right now, down by the creek last night, it was probably seven feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10660)|
| 2:57:50| It's like a lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10670)|
| 2:57:52| So my concern is if this land is developed, the land will become impervious to rainfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10672)|
| 2:58:03| It's going to run into the creek, further flooding my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10683)|
| 2:58:08| So, you know, a good decision needs to be made here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10688)|
| 2:58:15| I mean, eventually we get five, six inches of rain around here like we usually do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10695)|
| 2:58:20| and my house is going to be flooded, and that's right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10700)|
| 2:58:24| So I'll just leave it up to you guys, but I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10704)|
| 2:58:30| Hope you make a good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10710)|
| 2:58:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10711)|
| 2:58:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10712)|
| 2:58:41| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10721)|
| 2:58:43| I do appreciate Mr. Chittum's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10723)|
| 2:58:45| I did look at the YouTube videos and the pictures he had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10725)|
| 2:58:48| and he certainly does have a flooding problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10728)|
| 2:58:51| and I can certainly appreciate why he would be concerned about additional development in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10731)|
| 2:58:56| but we can't control what runoff may be coming from the property upstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10736)|
| 2:59:01| Right now the property is zoned PR-12, dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10741)|
| 2:59:05| and any residential development in that regard would also, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10745)|
| 2:59:10| raise the same concerns that we would have for the commercial zoning that we're seeking here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10750)|
| 2:59:15| What we do know is that, you know, this zoning is consistent with the adjacent CA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10755)|
| 2:59:23| It's consistent with the sector plan that's in place now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10763)|
| 2:59:25| It's consistent with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10765)|
| 2:59:28| It's in the urban growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10768)|
| 2:59:29| I mean, this highway is, you know, it's, you know, this corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10769)|
| 2:59:34| this entire corridor is a mixed-use corridor with the general development trend being commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10774)|
| 2:59:38| and Nashville highway and residential off of the side streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10778)|
| 2:59:42| and, you know, this is just going to help kind of continue out this zone split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10782)|
| 2:59:45| It's owned by the same property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10785)|
| 2:59:47| It's going to kind of finish out that commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10787)|
| 2:59:50| and allow a more meaningful commercial zone there, commercial development in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10790)|
| 2:59:57| and, you know, when we get to the point where we're developing it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10797)|
| 3:00:02| we'll have to have our engineers, you know, do a stormwater study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10802)|
| 3:00:06| They're going to have to work with Jim and Steve over here and his crew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10806)|
| 3:00:09| to make sure that the post-flow developments are, you know, equal to or less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10809)|
| 3:00:15| and certainly can't exceed what's there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10815)|
| 3:00:17| Now, we can't necessarily make Mr. Chittum's issue better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10817)|
| 3:00:22| but they're not going to let us build if we're going to make it worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10822)|
| 3:00:26| and that's really what we're looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10826)|
| 3:00:28| So staff has recommended approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10828)|
| 3:00:31| You know, this is basically a small commercial node,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10831)|
| 3:00:35| and it meets all the long-range planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10835)|
| 3:00:38| So I would respectfully request that you approve per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10838)|
| 3:00:44| Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10844)|
| 3:00:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10846)|
| 3:00:48| Mr. Elliott, Mr. Snowden, addressing Mr. Chittum there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10848)|
| 3:00:54| is there, you know, the elevation that got changed, can you comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10854)|
| 3:01:00| Yes, the launch back there did get filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10860)|
| 3:01:03| This is not a mapped FEMA flood zone, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10863)|
| 3:01:06| so that there was no restrictions upon them placing that field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10866)|
| 3:01:10| We did ask this developer of the Nils Landing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10870)|
| 3:01:13| to verify that the water they were adding would not flood any houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10873)|
| 3:01:18| and we will ask whoever develops this land to do the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10878)|
| 3:01:21| to do a study to prove to us that it won't cause any additional flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10881)|
| 3:01:28| At what point is he getting flooded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10888)|
| 3:01:31| I don't believe his structure's ever flooded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10891)|
| 3:01:34| but his backyard floods up close to his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10894)|
| 3:01:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10900)|
| 3:01:42| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10902)|
| 3:01:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10905)|
| 3:01:46| Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10906)|
| 3:01:47| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10907)|
| 3:01:49| Because of the comments that the county just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10909)|
| 3:01:54| and I would agree with the applicant that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10914)|
| 3:01:58| if this was owned agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10918)|
| 3:02:01| if there wasn't commercial in front of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10921)|
| 3:02:03| that the sector plan would support, I could see maybe a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10923)|
| 3:02:08| But at 12 for the acre, that's going to be just as intense as anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10928)|
| 3:02:13| and that CA probably is going to give a little more depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10933)|
| 3:02:16| to make a better commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10936)|
| 3:02:19| instead of just kind of fragmented small depths off of asphalt highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10939)|
| 3:02:23| So I would make a recommendation that we approve CA per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10943)|
| 3:02:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10949)|
| 3:02:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10950)|
| 3:02:31| We have a motion to approve per staff recommendation of Vice Chair Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10951)|
| 3:02:34| seconded by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10954)|
| 3:02:36| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10956)|
| 3:02:38| If not, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10958)|
| 3:02:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10960)|
| 3:02:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10961)|
| 3:02:42| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10962)|
| 3:02:45| Agenda item 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10965)|
| 3:02:47| Applicant, CMH Homes, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10967)|
| 3:02:49| Location, southeast side of Tipton Station Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10969)|

| 3:02:57| Approximate size of track, 20.67 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10977)|
| 3:03:00| Present zoning agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10980)|
| 3:03:02| Zoning requested plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10982)|

| 3:03:13| Staff recommendation, approve the PR zone up to five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10993)|
| 3:03:17| because it is compatible with surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10997)|
| 3:03:20| and supported by close proximity to community facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11000)|
| 3:03:24| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11004)|
| 3:03:26| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11006)|
| 3:03:27| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11007)|
| 3:03:30| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11010)|
| 3:03:32| We do have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11012)|
| 3:03:35| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11015)|
| 3:03:36| We have Spencer Proctor and Patricia Hooper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11016)|
| 3:03:42| And is it Sherry or Sherry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11022)|
| 3:03:46| Sherry Jockwa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11026)|
| 3:03:47| Sherry Jockwa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11027)|
| 3:03:48| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11028)|
| 3:03:49| Did I say it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11029)|
| 3:03:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11030)|
| 3:03:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11031)|
| 3:03:52| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11032)|
| 3:03:53| I'll defer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11033)|
| 3:03:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11034)|
| 3:03:56| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11036)|
| 3:03:59| My name is Spencer Proctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11039)|
| 3:04:00| I live at 2122 Tipton Station Road, the two acres there right behind the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11040)|
| 3:04:05| And first of all, thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11045)|
| 3:04:07| I know this is a long meeting so far, so I appreciate your attention to these matters and our city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11047)|
| 3:04:15| As we built there, you can imagine that the initial opposition came from a desire from a homeowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11055)|
| 3:04:21| to not have 65 homes, as Clayton has proposed, in front of my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11061)|
| 3:04:28| And then as I dug deeper into the research, I actually decided to dig my heels in a little bit deeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11068)|
| 3:04:33| because the research I'm doing doesn't support this development for a lot of reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11073)|
| 3:04:38| and it's not simply that I don't want houses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11078)|
| 3:04:41| So, first of all, I want to acknowledge that growth, as we've seen throughout this entire meeting, growth is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11081)|
| 3:04:47| It's a needed thing in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11087)|
| 3:04:49| We're under-housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11089)|
| 3:04:50| I understand that completely, and I empathize with the difficulty that you guys have of dictating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11090)|
| 3:04:56| That's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11096)|
| 3:04:58| But in this specific instance, I believe that being between two school zones of the high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11098)|
| 3:05:04| and Bonnie Kate Elementary really creates a lot of significant issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11104)|
| 3:05:09| So, for instance, per Tennessee Department of Transportation and coupling that with the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11109)|
| 3:05:16| there would be a 36% traffic increase with these 65 homes or this approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11116)|
| 3:05:22| along with the 33 that you see there above it that is later in this meeting, I believe, already approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11122)|
| 3:05:28| and it's in the site plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11128)|
| 3:05:30| So, 33 homes are already going in above us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11130)|
| 3:05:33| This one is going to be another at least 65, up to 103, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11133)|
| 3:05:37| and that creates a 36% traffic increase on a two-lane road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11137)|
| 3:05:43| and the only exit from that neighborhood would be through a school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11143)|
| 3:05:47| You cannot avoid a school zone exiting that neighborhood, no matter which direction or how you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11147)|
| 3:05:52| No side streets, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11152)|
| 3:05:55| Through the morning, I thought of going and videoing, but you can imagine that that close, about a half a mile apart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11155)|
| 3:06:01| we have schools, so the traffic is already horrible right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11161)|
| 3:06:05| So that's probably the main reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11165)|
| 3:06:08| In addition to that, if you look through even the staff report, again, I appreciate that they look at the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11168)|
| 3:06:16| It aligns with the growth plan in the South County sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11176)|
| 3:06:20| It aligns with the density of other neighborhoods there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11180)|
| 3:06:23| So I, again, empathize with that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11183)|
| 3:06:25| However, that sector plan also prescribed in 2012 when it was written a five-year plan and 15-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11185)|
| 3:06:34| with a lot of checkboxes of things that would be developed in an infrastructure around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11194)|
| 3:06:39| Greenways, I think there was about five greenways that were supposed to have been done within the 15-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11199)|
| 3:06:44| were four years from that 15-year plan having expired, and no ground has been broken on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11204)|
| 3:06:50| After conversations with the school zone or the school board, Bonnie Kate Elementary is almost at capacity as it sits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11210)|
| 3:06:58| and I know that they are already looking for a South County, Knox County solution to fix the schooling issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11218)|
| 3:07:06| and that's as it sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11226)|
| 3:07:08| So if we add children, now, again, the staff report says that approximately 22 children for this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11228)|
| 3:07:14| and then I can't remember the number of the other one, 33 homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11234)|
| 3:07:17| but I think that number is based on average per house added, this many kids per house that we build in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11237)|
| 3:07:25| I think that's going to be elevated in between school zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11245)|
| 3:07:28| because typically if you're going to purchase a home in such a school-heavy area, a kid-friendly area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11248)|
| 3:07:34| I think that that average is going to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11254)|
| 3:07:36| So we're adding more kids, and then you start to get into the conversation of transportation and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11256)|
| 3:07:42| Around every school, as you probably know, there's a one-mile buffer zone that is the parent responsibility zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11262)|
| 3:07:48| so there are no buses, which means that the sidewalks that we do have, which it's great to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11268)|
| 3:07:53| but those will be traversed by increasing number of students, 36 percent more traffic, thus more danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11273)|
| 3:08:01| So after seeing the zoning sign go up, you can see, yeah, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11281)|
| 3:08:07| If you go to the right, so the school is right there, and you scan back the other direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11287)|
| 3:08:12| you'll see the farmhouse that is in question, the blue house and the farmhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11292)|
| 3:08:16| And since that sector plan of 2012, there have been a handful of neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11296)|
| 3:08:21| hundreds and hundreds of homes already added, and none of the rest of the sector plan for our county beyond sewer that has been added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11301)|
| 3:08:29| and then Alcoa Highway is obviously under construction for all of our lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11309)|
| 3:08:34| So that's happening, and we appreciate the work there, but in our specific zone, between these school zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11314)|
| 3:08:40| nothing has been done to improve the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11320)|
| 3:08:43| The schools cannot handle that many more children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11323)|
| 3:08:46| There are plans for a new Hopewell school that are going to be 1,000 students per Christy Christy on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11326)|
| 3:08:53| However, ground has not been broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11333)|
| 3:08:55| They don't even know for sure where that will be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11335)|
| 3:08:58| Also in the sector plan was a community center that was going to be for the benefit of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11338)|
| 3:09:06| Mr. Proctor, you're out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11346)|
| 3:09:09| We've got, how many others do we have to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11349)|
| 3:09:13| We've got two others to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11353)|
| 3:09:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11356)|
| 3:09:17| And commission, how do you want to handle this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11357)|
| 3:09:20| You want to give each of them three minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11360)|
| 3:09:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11364)|
| 3:09:25| Please be aware when we have multiple speakers, try to share time as best you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11365)|
| 3:09:30| Anyway, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11370)|
| 3:09:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11371)|
| 3:09:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11372)|
| 3:09:35| Let's go three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11375)|
| 3:09:44| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11384)|
| 3:09:45| My name is Patricia Hooper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11385)|
| 3:09:47| I own property at 2130 Tipton Station and 2128.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11387)|
| 3:09:51| I am opposed to rezoning of the Loveless property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11391)|
| 3:09:54| I agree with the objections voiced in person recently at the Stock Creek Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11394)|
| 3:09:59| and the objections detailed on the public comments section of the Planning Commission website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11399)|
| 3:10:04| This is an immensely complicated issue for this entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11404)|
| 3:10:08| I come here today as one individual landowner to focus on one specific aspect of this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11408)|
| 3:10:14| I hold an enforceable joint permanent right-of-way easement that protects my physical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11414)|
| 3:10:18| and utility access to my property and which I share with Rosemary Loveless through her property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11418)|
| 3:10:24| My house is located on six-tenths of a mile off of Tipton Station at the end of Gravel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11424)|
| 3:10:29| This Gravel Road is where the joint permanent right-of-way easement runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11429)|
| 3:10:33| Three other landowners access their property and have utilities along this same easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11433)|
| 3:10:38| I have learned with recent professional research assistance in examining my property deeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11438)|
| 3:10:43| and previous deeds that this particular easement attached to my current deed has been in effect since 1916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11443)|
| 3:10:51| It has been conveyed as a right-of-way access easement continuously since 1916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11451)|
| 3:10:56| I am very concerned about what will happen with my property access and utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11456)|
| 3:11:00| if this property is developed by CMH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11460)|
| 3:11:04| My understanding is that this easement is permanent and cannot be removed by any other action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11464)|
| 3:11:08| except an imminent domain action from a governmental entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11468)|
| 3:11:12| I cannot be denied my right to use this easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11472)|
| 3:11:16| Neither can my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11476)|
| 3:11:18| No one from CMH has attempted to contact me about this crucial legal access to my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11478)|
| 3:11:24| Maybe CMH thinks this will just sort of work itself out after they take possession of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11484)|
| 3:11:29| Contacting me and the three other property owners directly affected by this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11489)|
| 3:11:33| would have certainly been a conciliatory action from CMH at the outset before the rezoning signs went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11493)|
| 3:11:40| The Planning Commission has mentioned my easement in their report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11500)|
| 3:11:43| under the section referencing the Knox County Zoning Ordinance, Article 6.30.01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11503)|
| 3:11:49| The following conditions must be met for all rezonings, must meet all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11509)|
| 3:11:55| And I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11515)|
| 3:11:56| The proposed amendment shall not adversely affect any other part of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11516)|
| 3:12:00| nor shall any direct or indirect adverse effects result from such amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11520)|
| 3:12:05| Paragraph 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11525)|
| 3:12:07| Continuing to quote from the planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11527)|
| 3:12:10| It is noteworthy that a joint permanent right-of-way easement runs through the subject property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11530)|
| 3:12:14| providing five parcels to the south with access to Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11534)|
| 3:12:19| This is an important consideration that would be incorporated into the development plan review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11539)|
| 3:12:24| providing additional assurance that the easement be maintained and improved upon as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11544)|
| 3:12:30| I'm glad to see this section in the Planning Commission's staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11550)|
| 3:12:34| It does acknowledge that an easement runs through the Loveless property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11554)|
| 3:12:37| and that it is an important consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11557)|
| 3:12:39| I think that is quite an understatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11559)|
| 3:12:41| I believe this is a crucial and legal matter for the CMH group to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11561)|
| 3:12:45| not just an important consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11565)|
| 3:12:47| I'm almost done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11567)|
| 3:12:49| I have questions that need to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11569)|
| 3:12:51| They're phrasing from the Planning Commission that the development plan review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11571)|
| 3:12:56| would provide additional assurance that the easement be maintained and improved upon as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11576)|
| 3:13:02| It is, in my opinion, an easy generic placeholder in this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11582)|
| 3:13:06| This does not address the certain upheaval that would occur in construction of this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11586)|
| 3:13:11| and the interruption of access and utility service to my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11591)|
| 3:13:15| I am not here just to say I don't want to be inconvenienced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11595)|
| 3:13:18| Rumors abound in situations like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11598)|
| 3:13:21| I've been told that CMH said that the easement road might have to be relocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11601)|
| 3:13:25| Ms. Hooper, we need to wrap up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11605)|
| 3:13:27| I'm almost done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11607)|
| 3:13:29| That would mean resurveying where the road is and drawing up new deeds for all affected landowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11609)|
| 3:13:34| to guarantee continued joint permanent right-of-way of easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11614)|
| 3:13:37| So this easement is as important to me in infrastructure as it is with all the remaining concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11617)|
| 3:13:43| that have been addressed relating to traffic safety, flooding, demands on schools, and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11623)|
| 3:13:48| So I do bring my concern to the hearing today as it appears that the overall impact of this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11628)|
| 3:13:55| and proposed development will have a direct or indirect adverse effect on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11635)|
| 3:14:00| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11640)|
| 3:14:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11642)|
| 3:14:04| Ms. Jacqua.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11644)|
| 3:14:13| Hi. My name is Cherie Jacque, and I live at 7630 Racing Run Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11653)|
| 3:14:18| So if you look close, right on that edge is my house, and I'm going to say selfishly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11658)|
| 3:14:24| I would love for my children to still be able to see the horses that are outside the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11664)|
| 3:14:29| I understand that there is progress to be had, and we have to develop homes somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11669)|
| 3:14:34| and I understand that it might not be a beautiful green pasture for forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11674)|
| 3:14:39| But in understanding what development is going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11679)|
| 3:14:45| it's been explained to me that CMA is developing with Clayton Mobile Homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11685)|
| 3:14:51| and I think there's a major issue in doing an entire development of mobile homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11691)|
| 3:15:01| They're unlike structures. They're not like any other of the developments around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11701)|
| 3:15:06| And according to HUD, most mobile homes only have a 30 to 50-year lifespan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11706)|
| 3:15:13| even if they're well-developed and maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11713)|
| 3:15:16| So what happens to all the surrounding neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11716)|
| 3:15:19| Do you have a neighborhood of haves and have-nots right next to a school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11719)|
| 3:15:24| I think that creates a terrible environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11724)|
| 3:15:26| I understand that there has to be homes that go in somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11726)|
| 3:15:29| Knoxville is getting bigger, and there's more people that want to come here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11729)|
| 3:15:33| and I completely understand that, but we have to be responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11733)|
| 3:15:38| The current traffic that's going on between the two school zones that have already been discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11738)|
| 3:15:43| creates a major issue as it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11743)|
| 3:15:47| and I'm very concerned about emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11747)|
| 3:15:49| If there's any moment that is during school drop-off or pickup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11749)|
| 3:15:56| there's no way that they could get through, and that's as-is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11756)|
| 3:16:00| That's forgetting about all of the development that's going to continue to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11760)|
| 3:16:04| So I just really want you guys to be responsible in the way that it happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11764)|
| 3:16:08| and choosing developers that are going to be responsible in the homes that they put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11768)|
| 3:16:14| I don't think mobile homes with a $300,000 price tag is affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11774)|
| 3:16:22| That sounds like a cycle of poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11782)|
| 3:16:25| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11785)|
| 3:16:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11787)|
| 3:16:28| If there's anyone else that wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11788)|
| 3:16:32| Is that all that has spoken? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11792)|
| 3:16:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11794)|
| 3:16:35| Councilor Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11795)|
| 3:16:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11797)|
| 3:16:48| Raise that podium if you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11808)|
| 3:16:51| That button on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11811)|
| 3:16:52| I probably need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11812)|
| 3:16:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11816)|
| 3:16:57| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street here for CMH Homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11817)|
| 3:17:00| appreciate the concerns that have been raised from the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11820)|
| 3:17:06| Just to touch briefly, Michelle did a very good job outlining staff's report on Tuesday's agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11826)|
| 3:17:14| so I don't want to plow that ground again too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11834)|
| 3:17:18| but staff's recommended approval for the five dwelling units and acre that we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11838)|
| 3:17:23| This is a rezoning only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11843)|
| 3:17:24| There will have to be a development plan come back through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11844)|
| 3:17:27| and I think that's something that people that are in opposition might not be fully aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11847)|
| 3:17:34| that a lot of the details as to how we're going to address the joint permanent easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11854)|
| 3:17:38| how many units we're actually going to be able to develop in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11858)|
| 3:17:42| what type of housing is going to go in, and how does that fit in with the rest of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11862)|
| 3:17:47| that's something that gets back before this body for a development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11867)|
| 3:17:51| and they'll have a full opportunity to look at what we're actually proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11871)|
| 3:17:55| and address additional concerns there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11875)|
| 3:17:58| So I want to touch on a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11878)|
| 3:18:00| The traffic issue, 36% increase in traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11880)|
| 3:18:03| I appreciate it sounds like he's done some research and is very well informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11883)|
| 3:18:08| I haven't seen his math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11888)|
| 3:18:10| I don't know where that number came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11890)|
| 3:18:12| We do know what an estimate is for the number of roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11892)|
| 3:18:15| but with five units an acre, if we were to develop that out, even at three-quarters density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11895)|
| 3:18:22| there would be a traffic impact analysis, a full traffic impact analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11902)|
| 3:18:25| and if there are improvements that need to be made because of the impact this development is causing to the road there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11905)|
| 3:18:32| we would have to share our proportion of those improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11912)|
| 3:18:38| whether that's additional greenways, whether that's additional sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11918)|
| 3:18:41| whether it's widening the road to some degree or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11921)|
| 3:18:45| That's something that will, again, come back before this body if a traffic impact analysis is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11925)|
| 3:18:52| But we don't know that yet at the rezoning because we don't know how many units we can develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11932)|
| 3:18:57| This property does have some environmental constraints, which is why PR is the perfect type of zone for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11937)|
| 3:19:03| I mean, there's a blue line stream on it, so we've got some, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11943)|
| 3:19:07| obviously there's some stormwater issues that will need to be addressed at the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11947)|
| 3:19:12| We'll need to address the access and the joint permanent easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11952)|
| 3:19:19| But, again, with the traffic, when you have a development next to a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11959)|
| 3:19:24| you hope that a lot of that traffic is alleviated, the school traffic at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11964)|
| 3:19:27| because you're in the parental responsibility zone and you can have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11967)|
| 3:19:31| access along sidewalks and even sidewalks, internal sidewalks of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11971)|
| 3:19:36| That will come forward, again, with the future development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11976)|
| 3:19:40| On the school capacity, I appreciate Ms. Portier's point that she made during development review that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11980)|
| 3:19:47| you know, this is something that goes to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11987)|
| 3:19:50| They're aware of this, and I'm sorry if I said it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11990)|
| 3:19:56| I keep trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11996)|
| 3:19:58| But it does go to the school board, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=11998)|
| 3:20:01| and if there is an issue whether or not they can address the additional school children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12001)|
| 3:20:07| that will be caused from this development, they have a chance to weigh in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12007)|
| 3:20:11| The estimate of 22 students, that comes from numbers that they put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12011)|
| 3:20:16| Actually, they're the ones that kind of estimate what kind of impact is from a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12016)|
| 3:20:22| But whenever you're dealing with that, you know, I think, and this is in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12022)|
| 3:20:28| student yields from a new development do not reflect a net addition of children in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12028)|
| 3:20:32| Additions occur incrementally over the build-out period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12032)|
| 3:20:35| New students may replace current population that ages through the system or moves from the attendance zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12035)|
| 3:20:41| So we don't know exactly when these students are going to be moving into the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12041)|
| 3:20:46| We don't know how many students are going to be matriculating out that they're going to be taking the place of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12046)|
| 3:20:50| You know, so that's really an unknown, and it's good information to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12050)|
| 3:20:56| and I do hope that they figure out, you know, where they're going to put the new school soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12056)|
| 3:21:01| because I know that's been mentioned before and that is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12061)|
| 3:21:04| But the impact from this development right now is not going to be significant on the student yield at 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12064)|
| 3:21:12| which is the best numbers that we do have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12072)|
| 3:21:18| The type of housing, it's not going to be a trailer park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12078)|
| 3:21:22| PR doesn't allow mobile homes or trailer parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12082)|
| 3:21:26| You know, there will have to be some development plan moving forward for the type of housing it's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12086)|
| 3:21:32| and the character of the communities is something that the PR zone does take into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12092)|
| 3:21:38| But, you know, at the zoning phase, we're looking at what zone is appropriate and what density is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12098)|
| 3:21:43| And here we have what is unique, and you have a very large undeveloped agricultural parcel next to a high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12103)|
| 3:21:51| That's not only next to a high school, but it's next to other public amenities because there are existing greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12111)|
| 3:21:57| There is a library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12117)|
| 3:21:58| There's an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12118)|
| 3:22:00| There's existing sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12120)|
| 3:22:02| The roads could be wider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12122)|
| 3:22:05| There's a 40-foot right-of-way, so there's room to widen those roads potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12125)|
| 3:22:09| But the infrastructure in place is there to support the zoning that we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12129)|
| 3:22:13| This is in the planned growth area of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12133)|
| 3:22:16| and the sector plan allows for medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12136)|
| 3:22:21| and the five units and acres is within what that 2012 plan has identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12141)|
| 3:22:29| And I think, and Commissioner Adams, you always do a great job mentioning this and bringing this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12149)|
| 3:22:34| and I think it's very important to remember here is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12154)|
| 3:22:37| we're looking at not the end user or what they're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12157)|
| 3:22:41| We're looking at the zone, whether it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12161)|
| 3:22:43| And so, you know, the density for the PR zone needs to be appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12163)|
| 3:22:47| whether it's CMH or whether it's somebody else that would come in and develop the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12167)|
| 3:22:53| And you also, I believe it was Commissioner Adams raised the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12173)|
| 3:22:59| it says we calculated the build-out of the PR zones around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12179)|
| 3:23:04| I mean, there's a wide range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12184)|
| 3:23:05| There's six different PR zones from five dwelling units an acre to the east of South Doyle High,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12185)|
| 3:23:12| and you've got one to three kind of to the northwest and across the road, one to four and one to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12192)|
| 3:23:18| So, again, we're at that, in that range between three and five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12198)|
| 3:23:26| We don't know if we'll be able to build out five dwelling units an acre once we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12206)|
| 3:23:29| That's what we're asking for, so it gives us the flexibility to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12209)|
| 3:23:33| how are these environmental constraints going to affect what we can actually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12213)|
| 3:23:37| It's very likely a development plan, even if it's zoned five units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12217)|
| 3:23:41| may come back at, you know, three or four or 3.8 or whatever the math comes down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12221)|
| 3:23:47| So the five units an acre is consistent with the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12227)|
| 3:23:50| and it just allows us some flexibility to do our engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12230)|
| 3:23:53| and figure out what works best with all these considerations in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12233)|
| 3:23:57| And, again, there will be review for these neighbors to come back and look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12237)|
| 3:24:02| and see what we're actually proposing at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12242)|
| 3:24:05| And so, you know, we will – I'll give everybody my information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12245)|
| 3:24:10| I know there was a very well-attended neighborhood meeting on August 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12250)|
| 3:24:15| I couldn't be there. I was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12255)|
| 3:24:18| But we did have representatives there that answered questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12258)|
| 3:24:21| And there will be additional neighborhood engagement between now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12261)|
| 3:24:25| and county commission meeting and more engagement between the final rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12265)|
| 3:24:31| and the development plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12271)|
| 3:24:33| So we'll continue to be in contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12273)|
| 3:24:35| If we haven't spoken to anybody as much as we need to, we'll make sure we correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12275)|
| 3:24:39| And we'll be back here in front of you again to tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12279)|
| 3:24:42| So with that, I would appreciate if you would follow staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12282)|
| 3:24:46| and approve this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12286)|
| 3:24:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12288)|
| 3:24:49| Thank you. Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12289)|
| 3:24:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12292)|
| 3:24:54| I've said it before, in fact, earlier, that I don't like to see us –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12294)|
| 3:24:59| when, you know, farmland gets turned into housing, it's less than ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12299)|
| 3:25:06| Or, well, no, when farmland gets developed a lot of times, you know, and wildlife areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12306)|
| 3:25:11| But I look at this and I see an existing infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12311)|
| 3:25:17| I see that it's right next to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12317)|
| 3:25:23| And, you know, I don't know how many people have had the opportunity as kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12323)|
| 3:25:30| to walk to school from where you lived or had friends that lived near school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12330)|
| 3:25:35| But I do think that if we're going to add housing, then putting it near resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12335)|
| 3:25:40| is just really a good way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12340)|
| 3:25:45| And, you know, there was mention of the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12345)|
| 3:25:47| And I was actually thinking that if there wasn't a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12347)|
| 3:25:52| that this wouldn't be very appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12352)|
| 3:25:54| But there's a direct path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12354)|
| 3:25:57| You know, there's a sidewalk that gets kids right to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12357)|
| 3:26:00| And I know this isn't going to be all kids and families living here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12360)|
| 3:26:05| but it creates an opportunity for people to live near the resources that they will depend on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12365)|
| 3:26:13| So I think that any time we can get developments near other uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12373)|
| 3:26:21| near existing infrastructure, I think it's the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12381)|
| 3:26:24| So I make the motion to approve for staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12384)|
| 3:26:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12389)|
| 3:26:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12390)|
| 3:26:31| We've got Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12391)|
| 3:26:34| Yeah, I was going to second that motion as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12394)|
| 3:26:36| But I am pretty familiar with the area in the sense that my mother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12396)|
| 3:26:42| and grandmother grew up out there on Twin Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12402)|
| 3:26:45| And I don't mean Twin Creek, the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12405)|
| 3:26:47| I mean Twin Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12407)|
| 3:26:49| So, you know, we spent a lot of time out there as children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12409)|
| 3:26:53| You know, that was probably back in the 40s and 50s when they were raised out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12413)|
| 3:26:58| I mean, beautiful area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12418)|
| 3:27:00| But it has grown significantly since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12420)|
| 3:27:04| You know, there's a public dump right down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12424)|
| 3:27:07| There is the Pinkston Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12427)|
| 3:27:09| It does have walking trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12429)|
| 3:27:11| As Commissioner Higgins mentioned, there's sidewalks all the way over to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12431)|
| 3:27:16| You know, I think it's a very appropriate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12436)|
| 3:27:20| Now, I agree with the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12440)|
| 3:27:22| and it's always a difficult discussion about how many more cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12442)|
| 3:27:26| when people are going to be walking and or driving in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12446)|
| 3:27:32| And that's a tough one because we have to still make decisions looking into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12452)|
| 3:27:38| But I think they are looking into the future with the addition of a new school going in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12458)|
| 3:27:45| So it's on the radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12465)|
| 3:27:48| And I think the folks in the area need to be prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12468)|
| 3:27:50| because when I drove out there to look at it, goodness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12470)|
| 3:27:52| I bet I saw four or five or six for sale signs with acreage tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12472)|
| 3:27:58| So, I mean, it's becoming a growth area in itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12478)|
| 3:28:03| But it is very well located, got good quality public schools that are within walking distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12483)|
| 3:28:10| So I'm very much in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12490)|
| 3:28:13| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12493)|
| 3:28:16| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12496)|
| 3:28:18| I concur with the placement here being beside a school, walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12498)|
| 3:28:24| It really does seem like if we're going to put residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12504)|
| 3:28:31| it's got things connecting that it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12511)|
| 3:28:35| But what doesn't make sense to me is that if there was a meeting with the developer and the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12515)|
| 3:28:42| there were over 80 comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12522)|
| 3:28:45| Ninety-six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12525)|
| 3:28:47| My math is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12527)|
| 3:28:48| I said over 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12528)|
| 3:28:49| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12529)|
| 3:28:50| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12530)|
| 3:28:51| It's 88 opposed and 84.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12531)|
| 3:28:53| I've read those, and many of them were talking about the type of home that would be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12533)|
| 3:29:01| Today, that sounds like that's not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12541)|
| 3:29:03| But there's obviously a lot of misinformation that is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12543)|
| 3:29:07| I don't know what happened at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12547)|
| 3:29:09| But before, I'd just like to say typically when there's a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12549)|
| 3:29:13| while there still may be a disagreement about the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12553)|
| 3:29:17| you might see a community saying we're not against this, we just like lower density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12557)|
| 3:29:21| or there's something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12561)|
| 3:29:23| This community seems to still be very much taken aback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12563)|
| 3:29:26| So that's not a good sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12566)|
| 3:29:29| I would like to hear if you were at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12569)|
| 3:29:32| Yes, I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12572)|
| 3:29:34| At that meeting, last I heard 140 to 150 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12574)|
| 3:29:38| I did not personally hear of anyone for this decision at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12578)|
| 3:29:42| So my curiosity would obviously be that at what point does the entire community coming against something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12582)|
| 3:29:48| make a difference in the decisions that are made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12588)|
| 3:29:51| So the uniqueness to me in those meetings and so on is that we were spoken to by Clayton at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12591)|
| 3:29:57| They seemed to have more information than implied here today that they wanted to do 65 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12597)|
| 3:30:03| My sentiment would be that if they're asking for five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12603)|
| 3:30:06| it will seem like a compromise when they come down to three point something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12606)|
| 3:30:10| But really, that was their plan all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12610)|
| 3:30:12| And 65 homes is still a lot of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12612)|
| 3:30:15| So the growth makes sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12615)|
| 3:30:17| But you mentioned, Commissioner, that there's properties all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12617)|
| 3:30:21| They're a large acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12621)|
| 3:30:23| These are between two school zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12623)|
| 3:30:24| So even at that meeting, it was addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12624)|
| 3:30:27| Why there and not even just a mile down the road on an 80-acre lot that's just down Tipton Station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12627)|
| 3:30:33| where the traffic can at least have an exit that is not in a school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12633)|
| 3:30:37| So it seems to me there's plenty of development opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12637)|
| 3:30:40| And no one's opposed to the development of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12640)|
| 3:30:43| We understand that that's inevitable and necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12643)|
| 3:30:46| But to do it in this exact spot is difficult on the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12646)|
| 3:30:51| Again, I understand the sidewalks and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12651)|
| 3:30:54| But that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12654)|
| 3:30:56| There hasn't been improvement since those were put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12656)|
| 3:30:58| Schools are already overloaded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12658)|
| 3:31:00| There's nowhere else to put anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12660)|
| 3:31:03| So that's the difficulty that I'm seeing is, like, I understand the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12663)|
| 3:31:06| Put it a mile that way, somebody's upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12666)|
| 3:31:10| There's always somebody upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12670)|
| 3:31:11| But it is much different to go just down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12671)|
| 3:31:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12674)|
| 3:31:15| Let's move along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12675)|
| 3:31:17| Anything else, Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12677)|
| 3:31:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12681)|
| 3:31:22| Seeing no other lights, we have a motion and a second to approve staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12682)|
| 3:31:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12688)|
| 3:31:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12689)|
| 3:31:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12690)|
| 3:31:32| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12692)|
| 3:31:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12693)|
| 3:31:35| Agenda item 25, applicant Chad Willight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12695)|
| 3:31:38| Location, east side of Childress Road, north of Pettigo Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12698)|
| 3:31:41| Approximate size, .89 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12701)|
| 3:31:43| Present zoning agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12703)|
| 3:31:45| Zoning requested, general residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12705)|
| 3:31:47| Existing land use, single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12707)|
| 3:31:50| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12710)|
| 3:31:51| We have staff recommendation, deny the general residential zone because it is inconsistent with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12711)|
| 3:31:58| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12718)|
| 3:32:00| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12720)|
| 3:32:01| My name is Chad Ward, 667 Maynardville Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12721)|
| 3:32:06| I'm the surveyor and representing both the applicant and the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12726)|
| 3:32:12| And this is oversight on our part, but we did not realize at the time we applied for this that the growth policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12732)|
| 3:32:19| the growth policy shows growth out to Pettigo Road, which is just to our east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12739)|
| 3:32:26| But the low density residential zoning comes all the way out and encompasses Childress Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12746)|
| 3:32:31| that large PR zoning you see to our northwest there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12751)|
| 3:32:35| To me, it seems like those two maps are out of sync with each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12755)|
| 3:32:38| like perhaps one got, you know, overlooked when they were updating the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12758)|
| 3:32:43| But our main reason for requesting the RB, the client would like to put two duplexes in there, four dwelling units total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12763)|
| 3:32:51| If we could do that with RA zoning, that would require subdividing the property into two separate lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12771)|
| 3:32:57| and possibly situating the two duplexes so that one would be shifted solid back and solid tucked in behind the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12777)|
| 3:33:03| which would not be as aesthetically pleasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12783)|
| 3:33:06| You'd still have four dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12786)|
| 3:33:08| We would prefer to put them in like a fourplex, four townhouses side by side where you have zero lot lines between them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12788)|
| 3:33:15| The rest of the property would remain undeveloped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12795)|
| 3:33:17| and you would end up with a more aesthetically pleasing use of the property for the same end result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12797)|
| 3:33:23| I don't know that it's within your power to do RB to go against the growth policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12803)|
| 3:33:27| I'm not sure what your abilities are in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12807)|
| 3:33:30| If you can do that, we would ask for the RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12810)|
| 3:33:32| If you cannot, then we would ask that you step back and give us RA, which would allow us to ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12812)|
| 3:33:39| it's currently zoned agricultural, which ties our hands completely, but water and sewer are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12819)|
| 3:33:45| So we would at the least like to have RA so that we can actually develop this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12825)|
| 3:33:50| And once again, housing is needed, and this is yet another place where we can put some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12830)|
| 3:33:55| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12835)|
| 3:33:57| Failed to ask about opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12837)|
| 3:33:59| Seeing no opposition, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12839)|
| 3:34:01| Mr. Reynolds, would you like to comment on the RA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12841)|
| 3:34:07| Well, as the applicant mentioned, the issue is the growth policy plan and the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12847)|
| 3:34:14| It only allows consideration of the agricultural zone or the planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12854)|
| 3:34:19| It does not allow consideration of the RA zone or the RB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12859)|
| 3:34:25| So from a staff perspective, we cannot recommend the RB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12865)|
| 3:34:30| The maximum allowed for planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12870)|
| 3:34:33| the maximum density allowed by the growth policy plan is three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12873)|
| 3:34:38| If a traffic impact letter is provided, two dwelling units per acre without one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12878)|
| 3:34:47| And one further comment, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12887)|
| 3:34:49| The PR zone, we did look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12889)|
| 3:34:51| Due to the ‑‑ even if you reduce the peripheral setbacks to the absolute minimum allowed by the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12891)|
| 3:34:57| that would be 15 feet all the way around both edges and the rear of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12897)|
| 3:35:01| which, once again, effectively eliminates the possibility of doing four units on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12901)|
| 3:35:10| Whereas RA, we do meet the ‑‑ and I understand, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12910)|
| 3:35:14| we're sort of caught in purgatory there between the growth policy and what the sector plan shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12914)|
| 3:35:20| But at RA zoning, we do meet the space and area requirements for dwelling units under RA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12920)|
| 3:35:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12932)|
| 3:35:33| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12933)|
| 3:35:41| I could ask one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12941)|
| 3:35:42| Mr. Reynolds, what is the process to change that growth policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12942)|
| 3:35:49| How long is that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12949)|
| 3:35:52| We are currently in the process of updating the county's land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12952)|
| 3:35:57| which also includes an update to the growth policy land map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12957)|
| 3:36:00| That's currently underway right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12960)|
| 3:36:02| Any timeframe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12962)|
| 3:36:04| My clients are going to ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12964)|
| 3:36:05| I might as well ask you while I've got you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12965)|
| 3:36:08| It still has to go before this body and the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12968)|
| 3:36:12| and that's intended to happen this fall, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12972)|
| 3:36:15| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12975)|
| 3:36:17| Commissioner Midas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12977)|
| 3:36:19| I guess I was just going to ask Mike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12979)|
| 3:36:21| can you talk a little bit about what he would need to do then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12981)|
| 3:36:24| in order to either allow this or go ahead and rezone it to RB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12984)|
| 3:36:38| So we have plan recommendations, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=12998)|
| 3:36:45| I guess it's up to planning commission and ultimately county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13005)|
| 3:36:48| whether or not they're going to stay consistent with the plan recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13008)|
| 3:36:54| As the applicant mentioned, we are in kind of a weird spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13014)|
| 3:36:56| where land use plan section plan recommends low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13016)|
| 3:37:00| In the low-density residential land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13020)|
| 3:37:02| RB can be considered as another zone to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13022)|
| 3:37:05| It's not one of the primary zones to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13025)|
| 3:37:10| As we mentioned, the crux of the problem is the rural area and the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13030)|
| 3:37:15| There's really no way to amend that other than, as Director Brooks mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13035)|
| 3:37:21| it's already going through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13041)|
| 3:37:25| This fall, hopefully, it will be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13045)|
| 3:37:27| I don't know what this particular property shows on that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13047)|
| 3:37:34| One other quick point, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13054)|
| 3:37:36| There's a large subdivision behind us that's already zoned RB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13056)|
| 3:37:39| that's been there for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13059)|
| 3:37:42| At some point in time, I've got to get control of this meeting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13062)|
| 3:37:46| I've let it go way too long, and that's my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13066)|
| 3:37:49| Once we get it here, just so everybody understands the procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13069)|
| 3:37:52| once we get it here and list your address, we keep it right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13072)|
| 3:37:55| until we either accept, deny, or make some modifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13075)|
| 3:38:00| I'm sorry, but let's keep it in discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13080)|
| 3:38:04| Yeah, I was just trying to figure out a way that you could get that without having to go through a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13084)|
| 3:38:10| I think that's a reasonable question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13090)|
| 3:38:13| How are we best helping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13093)|
| 3:38:15| That's what this commission, I think, wants to know from staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13095)|
| 3:38:20| What's its best option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13100)|
| 3:38:24| Well, the planned residential zone is allowed by both policy plan and by the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13104)|
| 3:38:33| The three dwelling units per acre max by the rural area would not get three dwelling units on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13113)|
| 3:38:39| because I think the property is about .9 acres, somewhere around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13119)|
| 3:38:44| So to get two units, you need 2.25 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13124)|
| 3:38:48| The three dwelling units per acre does not get you a third unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13128)|
| 3:38:51| So you're really just looking at two units under the planned residential at three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13131)|
| 3:38:57| Even at five dwelling units per acre, you're probably still not getting four in the planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13137)|
| 3:39:05| Is RA an option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13145)|
| 3:39:11| No, it's not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13151)|
| 3:39:14| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13154)|
| 3:39:16| If this is rolling out in a couple of months, is it advisable or possible to postpone until that time when this may become a moot issue and it's addressed in another way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13156)|
| 3:39:30| I can't speak specifically to this parcel at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13170)|
| 3:39:35| We could take a look at it if you all want to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13175)|
| 3:39:38| I don't know that the revisions will include this particular parcel, but we can look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13178)|
| 3:39:43| Because of these kind of inconsistencies, I guess we still have the authority to recommend something that might be yet inconsistent with the growth policy plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13183)|
| 3:39:57| That is within your purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13197)|
| 3:39:59| As staff, we would not recommend that you take that path, but yes, it's within your purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13199)|
| 3:40:08| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13208)|
| 3:40:10| Is this not recommended to light or not recommended to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13210)|
| 3:40:16| I know what you're asking. Is this a soft denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13216)|
| 3:40:19| We recommend that you follow the plans that are currently in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13219)|
| 3:40:26| I guess I make a motion to approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13226)|
| 3:40:46| Is there any advantage to tabling it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13246)|
| 3:40:49| I'm just trying to think about the applicant and helping them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13249)|
| 3:40:54| If this was to change, would they be allowed to come back and try again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13254)|
| 3:41:00| If it's denied at this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13260)|
| 3:41:03| If you all want us to take a closer look and see where things might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13263)|
| 3:41:07| We can't predict. Obviously, it still needs to go through a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13267)|
| 3:41:11| I don't anticipate that process to be complete until after the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13271)|
| 3:41:15| But you also could postpone this and we could take a closer look to see if it might even be a remote possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13275)|
| 3:41:23| If it was denied, it's a year before they could try again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13283)|
| 3:41:35| Commissioner Midas, your motion was to approve per staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13295)|
| 3:41:41| but I think you probably meant to say deny per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13301)|
| 3:41:45| I just need to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13305)|
| 3:41:47| They recommended to deny it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13307)|
| 3:41:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13309)|
| 3:41:51| It is a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13311)|
| 3:41:53| I'm up to removing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13313)|
| 3:41:57| Would it be something you would want to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13317)|
| 3:42:05| I would like to ask if you would consider amending your motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13325)|
| 3:42:10| Yes, I would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13330)|
| 3:42:12| Okay, so we have a motion to postpone for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13332)|
| 3:42:15| Well, are we going to wait until it would be the first of the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13335)|
| 3:42:20| You were going to give just a quick assessment of it that might give a little more light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13340)|
| 3:42:24| We would need to take a look and see where the draft map is and how this parcel is impacted by that draft map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13344)|
| 3:42:32| Would 30 days be an adequate amount of time for us to take a look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13352)|
| 3:42:35| For us to take a look, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13355)|
| 3:42:37| I make a motion that we postpone it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13357)|
| 3:42:40| And I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13360)|
| 3:42:41| All right, we have a motion to postpone by Commissioner Minus, seconded by Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13361)|
| 3:42:46| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13366)|
| 3:42:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13368)|
| 3:42:49| Any opposed? Motion carries. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13369)|
| 3:42:51| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13371)|
| 3:42:53| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13373)|
| 3:42:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13376)|
| 3:42:58| Mr. Forrester, would you like to come before the podium here and make a request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13378)|
| 3:43:02| Yes, on agenda item 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13382)|
| 3:43:04| And I know it's out of term, but I've got to get to a previously scheduled Board of Mayor and Aldermen meeting in Fairgate at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13384)|
| 3:43:09| And so we'd ask that it be postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13389)|
| 3:43:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13392)|
| 3:43:13| Agenda item 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13393)|
| 3:43:14| I think it's 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13394)|
| 3:43:15| Agenda item 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13395)|
| 3:43:17| 8A23R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13397)|
| 3:43:20| Do we need to make a motion to take it out of order or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13400)|
| 3:43:28| Okay, so could I get a motion to address this item 32 out of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13408)|
| 3:43:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13416)|
| 3:43:37| Okay, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13417)|
| 3:43:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13418)|
| 3:43:41| Okay, Commissioner Levinson made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13421)|
| 3:43:45| Who made the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13425)|
| 3:43:46| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13426)|
| 3:43:47| Okay, Commissioner Schell, so with a second, seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13427)|
| 3:43:50| You may have some opposition to the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13430)|
| 3:43:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13432)|
| 3:43:53| All right, bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13433)|
| 3:43:54| Can we get clarification on what item 32 is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13434)|
| 3:43:57| To postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13437)|
| 3:43:59| But which item is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13439)|
| 3:44:01| It's Amy Sherrill is the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13441)|
| 3:44:03| It's 8-A-23-UR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13443)|
| 3:44:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13445)|
| 3:44:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13446)|
| 3:44:07| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13447)|
| 3:44:09| All in favor to postpone for 30 days, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13449)|
| 3:44:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13451)|
| 3:44:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13452)|
| 3:44:13| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13453)|
| 3:44:14| All right, let's get back to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13454)|
| 3:44:18| Number 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13458)|
| 3:44:20| Applicant Samuel Harward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13460)|
| 3:44:22| Location, north side of River Drive at Birchfield Drive, .76 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13462)|
| 3:44:28| Present zoning, RAE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13468)|
| 3:44:30| Zoning requested, RA, low density residential, existing land use, single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13470)|
| 3:44:36| And we have a staff recommendation, deny the RA, low density residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13476)|
| 3:44:41| because it is inconsistent with the surrounding developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13481)|
| 3:44:45| The applicant available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13485)|
| 3:44:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13486)|
| 3:44:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13487)|
| 3:44:48| So I'm Samuel Harward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13488)|
| 3:44:49| I live at 8117 River Drive, so the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13489)|
| 3:44:56| My goal is to add a detached garage next to my house and put a guest house above that garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13496)|
| 3:45:04| And so I started by getting a septic permit and was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13504)|
| 3:45:10| Then I got architectural plans and requested from planning a EMS address for the guest house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13510)|
| 3:45:21| Got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13521)|
| 3:45:23| But then when it went to permitting, the fact that this is RAE was flagged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13523)|
| 3:45:28| And evidently in an RAE zone, a second dwelling is not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13528)|
| 3:45:36| So my request is to change this from RAE to RA, which still does not automatically grant the guest house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13536)|
| 3:45:46| but it would be use on permit or use on approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13546)|
| 3:45:52| I'm not sure what the term is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13552)|
| 3:45:54| Use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13554)|
| 3:45:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13555)|
| 3:45:56| Use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13556)|
| 3:45:59| I think that it is consistent with other zoning in the area, because if you look on my same street, there is an RA there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13559)|
| 3:46:06| And the closest subdivision, if you zoom out a little bit more, is across Pellissippi Parkway on Jolly Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13566)|
| 3:46:12| And that's also RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13572)|
| 3:46:17| I love my neighborhood for its quietness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13577)|
| 3:46:20| So I don't love it for the narrow roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13580)|
| 3:46:25| And I think that this change would not necessarily increase density in the neighborhood or cause a problem with the narrow roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13585)|
| 3:46:35| Because every time that somebody wanted to increase density by putting a guest house or something, would be on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13595)|
| 3:46:49| I talked with Bobby Fox, who left the public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13609)|
| 3:46:53| I also spoke with several other neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13613)|
| 3:46:56| Everyone was in approval of the idea, with the exception of Bobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13616)|
| 3:47:02| And his concern was he didn't want the density of the neighborhood to increase, but he did like the idea of building the guest house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13622)|
| 3:47:11| And he had not understood that there is actually a septic permit in place, so he was fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13631)|
| 3:47:17| That was his other part to the comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13637)|
| 3:47:19| So my question is, can we approve this as RA and then approve it use on review because it is consistent with the other houses in the neighborhood and it doesn't increase density to a bad level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13639)|
| 3:47:35| Or is there another way to achieve this building that everyone in the neighborhood is in favor of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13655)|
| 3:47:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13668)|
| 3:47:56| Commission, let's go with Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13676)|
| 3:48:00| I may have noticed that I'm in favor of ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13680)|
| 3:48:04| So I just want to ask staff about this, to kind of speak to the RA, the recommendation to deny, and if there is any other alternative options for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13684)|
| 3:48:26| I think the main reason to deny was just there haven't been any large changes in this area in decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13706)|
| 3:48:38| That was the first criteria for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13718)|
| 3:48:42| That was essentially the main reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13722)|
| 3:48:46| And I don't think that, I think RA is a very similar zone, so I don't have terrible concern about that, but I just couldn't recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13726)|
| 3:49:04| And a use on review would come back to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13744)|
| 3:49:08| You can't do that all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13748)|
| 3:49:10| Sorry, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13750)|
| 3:49:12| I'm not asking for an exception there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13752)|
| 3:49:15| I'd like to make a motion that we go against staff's recommendation and approve it, if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13755)|
| 3:49:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13762)|
| 3:49:24| Make a motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13764)|
| 3:49:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13766)|
| 3:49:28| Against staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13768)|
| 3:49:30| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13770)|
| 3:49:32| Make sure we've got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13772)|
| 3:49:34| Is that a satisfactory motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13774)|
| 3:49:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13776)|
| 3:49:38| We got a motion by Commissioner Higgins, seconded by Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13778)|
| 3:49:42| And let's see, I guess we need to give some reason maybe that it is similar and it's not that different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13782)|
| 3:49:53| Give me something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13793)|
| 3:49:55| That would be my reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13795)|
| 3:49:57| If you'd like to articulate the rationale for your motion, that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13797)|
| 3:50:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13801)|
| 3:50:03| Because the RA zoning is not very different from the RAE, and I think it would fit in with the rest of the neighborhood and surrounding zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13803)|
| 3:50:20| All right, so we've got a motion, a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13820)|
| 3:50:25| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13825)|
| 3:50:26| So is the use permitted on review the garage apartment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13826)|
| 3:50:30| Is that what this would qualify as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13830)|
| 3:50:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13833)|
| 3:50:35| Okay, so, and this is in the county, so we could do a condition where the garage apartment is the only use permitted on review for this RA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13835)|
| 3:50:47| The only additional use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13847)|
| 3:50:49| Is that what you're getting at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13849)|
| 3:50:51| Yes, the only additional use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13851)|
| 3:50:52| So, and that might alleviate concerns in the future for duplexes, group daycare, you know, all these other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13852)|
| 3:50:59| So if you're open to a friendly amendment, I think it, since we're trying to accommodate, I think that would be a good condition to add that the only use permitted on review are garage apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13859)|
| 3:51:14| I'll amend my motion to include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13874)|
| 3:51:22| As a use on review garage apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13882)|
| 3:51:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13886)|
| 3:51:28| As the only additional use from RAE would be that garage apartments would be permitted still as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13888)|
| 3:51:41| The only additional use on review permitted on this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13901)|
| 3:51:47| I still second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13907)|
| 3:51:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13909)|
| 3:51:50| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13910)|
| 3:51:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13913)|

| 3:51:55| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13915)|
| 3:51:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13916)|
| 3:51:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13917)|
| 3:51:58| Where are we going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13918)|

| 3:52:01| 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13921)|
| 3:52:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13922)|
| 3:52:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13925)|

| 3:52:19| 26.2 acres, zoning plan residential, existing land use, agricultural, forestry, vacant land, proposed use attached, attached, residential, subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13939)|
| 3:52:30| Number of lots, 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13950)|
| 3:52:32| Subdivision variances, we have one, we have alternative design standards, and what else do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13952)|
| 3:52:45| And then the staff recommendation is we're going to have looks like three motions on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13965)|
| 3:52:54| The first one is to approve the requested variance and alternative design standards based on the justification provided by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13974)|
| 3:53:01| Motion two, approve the concept plan subject to six conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13981)|
| 3:53:06| Motion three, approve the development plan for residential subdivision with up to 57 attached dwellings on individual lots, as shown on the plan, subject to two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13986)|
| 3:53:16| Applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13996)|
| 3:53:18| Yes, Drew Statton, PO Box 11315, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=13998)|
| 3:53:23| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14003)|
| 3:53:25| Seeing no opposition, please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14005)|
| 3:53:28| I respectfully request the approval per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14008)|
| 3:53:31| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14011)|
| 3:53:33| Make a motion to approve per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14013)|
| 3:53:36| We've got a motion by Commissioner Barger to approve per staff recommendation, seconded by Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14016)|
| 3:53:44| Commissioner Schell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14024)|
| 3:53:46| In looking at the site plan, I was asking about parking and if there were sidewalks on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14026)|
| 3:53:53| If people are parking on the street and walking to, where's the mailbox location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14033)|
| 3:54:01| Is it in the other section of the subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14041)|
| 3:54:06| I guess what I'd be concerned about is are cars parked on the street that's curved, people walking to go get their mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14046)|
| 3:54:14| and people driving in and hitting the people walking on the street because there are no sidewalks, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14054)|
| 3:54:22| It's just guest parking, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14062)|
| 3:54:24| It's just guest parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14064)|
| 3:54:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14066)|
| 3:54:31| Well, the motion's made, so I'll just cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14071)|
| 3:54:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14075)|

| 3:54:40| Commissioner Higgins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14080)|
| 3:54:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14082)|

| 3:54:56| That's the motion that had been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14096)|
| 3:55:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14100)|

| 3:55:30| Her motion was with regard to the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14130)|
| 3:55:32| We can do them in either order, but I just want to clarify that that was her motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14132)|

| 3:55:57| Subject to six conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14157)|
| 3:55:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14158)|
| 3:55:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14159)|
| 3:56:00| We've got a motion to approve the concept plan subject to six conditions by Commissioner Levinson, seconded by Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14160)|
| 3:56:05| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14165)|

| 3:56:08| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14168)|
| 3:56:09| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14169)|
| 3:56:10| Chair will entertain a motion on the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14170)|
| 3:56:14| I make a motion on the development plan per staff's recommendation to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14174)|
| 3:56:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14180)|
| 3:56:21| We have a motion by Commissioner Barger to approve the development plan for residential subdivision up to 57 attached dwellings on individual lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14181)|
| 3:56:33| subject to the two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14193)|
| 3:56:37| And it was seconded by Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14197)|
| 3:56:40| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14200)|
| 3:56:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14202)|

| 3:56:46| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14206)|
| 3:56:47| I don't think I have 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14207)|
| 3:57:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14238)|
| 3:57:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14242)|
| 3:57:23| Is item 37 replat of Lantern Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14243)|
| 3:57:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14274)|
| 3:58:20| So item 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14300)|
| 3:58:23| Recommendation is the concept plan indicating the overall layout design for this plat was approved on 2-10-2022 as planning case 1SB-22C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14303)|
| 3:58:33| Subdivision regulations section 2.08.A and 2.10.F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14313)|
| 3:58:41| Final plat must be in substantial conformance with the approved concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14321)|
| 3:58:45| Planning staff affirms that this plat is in substantial conformance with the concept plan and recommends approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14325)|
| 3:58:51| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14331)|
| 3:58:52| I am Ben Mellons, 550 West Main Street, here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14332)|
| 3:58:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14336)|
| 3:58:57| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14337)|
| 3:58:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14338)|
| 3:58:59| Do you want to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14339)|
| 3:59:01| I'll proceed briefly and then defer or reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14341)|
| 3:59:07| The only issue here before the board is whether or not the final plat substantially complies with the approved concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14347)|
| 3:59:15| I have not heard any arguments that it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14355)|
| 3:59:17| Staff has recommended and affirmed I think twice now it was administratively approved previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14357)|
| 3:59:25| and then realized that there was a change in the law and can no longer be administratively approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14365)|
| 3:59:30| So we're coming now before this body as the statute requires us to to have it approved by the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14370)|
| 3:59:37| But it does comply substantially with the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14377)|
| 3:59:40| We'd ask you to follow staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14380)|
| 3:59:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14382)|
| 3:59:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14385)|
| 3:59:46| Opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14386)|
| 3:59:49| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14389)|
| 3:59:50| Matthew Brooks on behalf of Massey Creek HOA 12067 Salt Creek Lane 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14390)|
| 3:59:58| Our attorney, Daniel Sanders, wasn't able to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14398)|
| 4:00:02| He sent a letter in on the public comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14402)|
| 4:00:04| I'm going to read a little bit from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14404)|
| 4:00:08| Mr. Sanders represents Massey Creek HOA in opposition to the above final plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14408)|
| 4:00:16| This subdivision is the subject of two separate lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14416)|
| 4:00:19| The preliminary approval of this subdivision is being litigated in Knox County Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14419)|
| 4:00:26| The patently illegal administration approval of a final plat by staff on June 13th is the subject of a second lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14426)|
| 4:00:35| Approval of the final plat before you now will likely be the subject of a third suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14435)|
| 4:00:41| We ask that you defer consideration of the application for at least 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14441)|
| 4:00:47| Approval is violating subdivision regulations and the administrative rules by considering the plat at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14447)|
| 4:00:55| Pursuant to the administrative rules, the application deadline for Planning Commission's August 10th meeting was June 26th, 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14455)|
| 4:01:05| The Lantern Park final plat application was submitted on July 7th and accompanied by a filing fee of $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14465)|
| 4:01:13| The submission was more than one week after the application deadline, four days after the extended double fee deadline of June 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14473)|
| 4:01:22| Furthermore, records will show that the application was incomplete when it was submitted and remained so after the final plat corrections deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14482)|
| 4:01:30| At a minimum, the application fee of $250 was insufficient for a final plat of 28 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14490)|
| 4:01:36| Additionally, the final plat uploaded to the webpage on August 1st fails to affix any of the required certifications with signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14496)|
| 4:01:45| There are likely other aspects of the final plat that were incomplete, such as to prohibit consideration at your August meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14505)|
| 4:01:51| While we object to your consideration of the final plat because it violates your own rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14511)|
| 4:01:56| it is your duty as commissioners to ensure that plats under your consideration are in proper form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14516)|
| 4:02:01| We request that you defer consideration of the final plat until it meets the requirements of your own administrative rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14521)|
| 4:02:08| As Mr. Sanders later very quickly, from my standpoint at the HOA, the concept plan is in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14528)|
| 4:02:18| We are awaiting judgment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14538)|
| 4:02:22| They tried to push through a final plat administratively, which is against state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14542)|
| 4:02:27| We filed a lawsuit on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14547)|
| 4:02:29| Once it was brought up in court, it was pushed through on this meeting past deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14549)|
| 4:02:34| So I ask that you deny it or consider postponement until we can get judgment on the concept plan or until proper filings are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14554)|
| 4:02:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14565)|
| 4:02:52| Thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14572)|
| 4:02:53| I understand the administrative rules are something that can be suspended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14573)|
| 4:02:58| or exceptions can be made by this body under certain circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14578)|
| 4:03:03| We are not the only final plat that got caught up in the change in the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14583)|
| 4:03:09| This was submitted for administrative approval before the statute changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14589)|
| 4:03:16| but it was not approved until June after the statute became in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14596)|
| 4:03:20| and that was where some of the confusion came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14600)|
| 4:03:23| We weren't trying to circumvent the system or do anything illegal with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14603)|
| 4:03:27| but there was a filing fee paid for the final plat when it was reviewed administratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14607)|
| 4:03:32| When it was approved administratively, we had all the signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14612)|
| 4:03:35| There's not a change in the final plat that was reviewed then and what's before the body now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14615)|
| 4:03:39| It's just we're correcting the error in where the law had changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14619)|
| 4:03:43| where now this body has to review these types of final plats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14623)|
| 4:03:47| So the administrative rules can be suspended by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14627)|
| 4:03:54| In fact, the next seven final plats are in a similar situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14634)|
| 4:04:00| The only issue is it doesn't have the history behind this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14640)|
| 4:04:07| Now, this was something that was approved by this body in February 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14647)|
| 4:04:11| The Board of Zoning Appeals approved it in March 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14651)|
| 4:04:15| It is being litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14655)|
| 4:04:16| We're waiting on a decision, but the concept plan is legal until the courts tell us it's not legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14656)|
| 4:04:22| and so we are entitled to move forward with the final plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14662)|
| 4:04:25| And, again, the only consideration for this board is does the final plat substantially comply with the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14665)|
| 4:04:31| and it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14671)|
| 4:04:33| There's not an argument that has been advanced that it hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14673)|
| 4:04:36| One more thing I want to point out, really, how would an objecting neighbor be aggrieved over the filing fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14676)|
| 4:04:48| How would they be aggrieved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14688)|
| 4:04:50| They have notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14690)|
| 4:04:51| They have opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14691)|
| 4:04:53| There was an attorney here, I guess, like Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14693)|
| 4:04:55| He had to be somewhere else, couldn't stay this long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14695)|
| 4:04:57| They did have another attorney here earlier, Mr. Alan Rawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14697)|
| 4:05:00| He actually asked for this to be taken off of the consent list, I believe, in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14700)|
| 4:05:05| They were aware of this before it was refiled before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14705)|
| 4:05:11| In fact, we told their attorney after they filed the lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14711)|
| 4:05:15| we are going to refile it so we will get it approved the way the statute reads now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14715)|
| 4:05:20| So there's no prejudice to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14720)|
| 4:05:23| There's no harm to them for this body hearing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14723)|
| 4:05:26| And so we'd ask that you follow staff's recommendation and approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14726)|
| 4:05:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14729)|
| 4:05:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14730)|
| 4:05:31| Director Brooks, would you like to add any comments to this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14731)|
| 4:05:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14737)|
| 4:05:38| I'd be happy to address some of the concerns that were raised about this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14738)|
| 4:05:46| As you all know, and Mr. Mullins also alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14746)|
| 4:05:49| so once we were made aware of this change in state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14749)|
| 4:05:52| we added all the plats that were affected that were currently in queue for 26 or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14752)|
| 4:06:01| You all are well aware of this because we talked about it on several different occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14761)|
| 4:06:05| and we had a special called meeting to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14765)|
| 4:06:08| And so the reason that we went ahead and added them is because we wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14768)|
| 4:06:13| in good faith effort, honor the process that we had been using to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14773)|
| 4:06:19| So all of the plats that are on your agenda that have been pulled off consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14779)|
| 4:06:25| they were noticed properly by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14785)|
| 4:06:29| They needed 15 days and we made sure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14789)|
| 4:06:32| But, yes, all of them, they were taken in after the official filing date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14792)|
| 4:06:38| But, again, we had been taking all of these plats in previously as administrative plats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14798)|
| 4:06:43| so they wouldn't have had to follow that specific deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14803)|
| 4:06:46| but they did meet the noticing requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14806)|
| 4:06:51| I'm not going to spend any time talking about the specifics of this final plat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14811)|
| 4:06:55| because it had already been certified and filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14815)|
| 4:07:00| But I will touch on the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14820)|
| 4:07:02| So we didn't process this as a final plat because that had already been done previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14822)|
| 4:07:08| Our fees are the same regardless of whether or not they are administrative or a final plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14828)|
| 4:07:16| This was taken in as an amended plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14836)|
| 4:07:21| So the $250 that was charged was applicable to what's called a corrected plat, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14841)|
| 4:07:28| because it didn't need to go through the process of addressing any lot lines were changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14848)|
| 4:07:35| and that it didn't need to go through closure again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14855)|
| 4:07:42| So with the two things that changed were there were two notes that were changed on the plat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14862)|
| 4:07:50| to reflect parcel numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14870)|
| 4:07:52| So when we looked at it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14872)|
| 4:07:54| we realized that staff had overlooked that there were common areas that were given lot numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14874)|
| 4:07:59| and that was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14879)|
| 4:08:00| We had them remove those so those couldn't be considered lots in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14880)|
| 4:08:04| And then there was a second note that was revised just to provide the date of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14884)|
| 4:08:10| So those were the revisions that took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14890)|
| 4:08:13| As was mentioned in the correspondence that was submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14893)|
| 4:08:17| the signatures that they were not on the plats prior to submittal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14897)|
| 4:08:23| they don't require signatures prior to you all reviewing these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14903)|
| 4:08:26| because there is a chance that you will not approve them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14906)|
| 4:08:29| and we don't want applicants to be going through the process of getting all the signatures needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14909)|
| 4:08:34| because you all haven't actually approved the plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14914)|
| 4:08:38| So that happens after planning commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14918)|
| 4:08:41| I'm happy to try to answer any additional questions you have about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14921)|
| 4:08:46| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14926)|
| 4:08:48| So I guess this just gets back into all the confusion, the challenging things we've had today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14928)|
| 4:08:53| But I don't think this one is that much confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14933)|
| 4:08:57| I mean, it's the whole horse got out of the barn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14937)|
| 4:09:00| and then when the county was notified that we were doing it incorrectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14940)|
| 4:09:06| we adjusted it, had special meetings, voted on it, kind of put the horse back in the barn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14946)|
| 4:09:12| And now they're trying to say it's back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14952)|
| 4:09:17| I guess what I'm hearing is we've done everything properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14957)|
| 4:09:22| and heard the legal way to do it, unless I'm hearing something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14962)|
| 4:09:27| I mean, this plat was approved and recorded, it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14967)|
| 4:09:32| I mean, it was recorded at the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14972)|
| 4:09:35| And then when we were made aware that, okay, you're doing this incorrectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14975)|
| 4:09:41| that's what I'm saying, it reversed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14981)|
| 4:09:44| and then we're just putting the horse back where it belongs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14984)|
| 4:09:49| So I think it's pretty cut and dry to just move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14989)|
| 4:09:54| So I'd be in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14994)|
| 4:09:57| So should our motion be that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=14997)|
| 4:10:02| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15002)|
| 4:10:03| I was just going to say a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15003)|
| 4:10:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15005)|
| 4:10:06| All right, we've got a motion to approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15006)|
| 4:10:10| Yes, as read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15010)|
| 4:10:11| Commissioner Higgins, seconded by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15011)|
| 4:10:14| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15014)|
| 4:10:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15016)|
| 4:10:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15017)|
| 4:10:18| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15018)|
| 4:10:20| For the purposes of these next items, 38, 39, 41, 42, and 43,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15020)|
| 4:10:27| those were all taken off consent because they followed the exact same procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15027)|
| 4:10:32| that this item 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15032)|
| 4:10:36| So I just want to point that out to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15036)|
| 4:10:40| We can take them up one at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15040)|
| 4:10:42| or because they had previously been on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15042)|
| 4:10:45| you can determine in your discretion, Mr. Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15045)|
| 4:10:48| I think if you want to try to group them subject to what you all decide to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15048)|
| 4:10:54| But ultimately the reason those were taken off consent is because it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15054)|
| 4:10:57| exactly the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15057)|
| 4:11:00| Okay, so we're going to be, I guess, deliberating on a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15060)|
| 4:11:06| in the same manner as we had just a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15066)|
| 4:11:09| I'm going to recommend that we group them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15069)|
| 4:11:12| So we're going to take 38, 39, 41, 42, and 43 as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15072)|
| 4:11:18| One vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15078)|
| 4:11:20| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15080)|
| 4:11:22| Too soon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15082)|
| 4:11:23| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15083)|
| 4:11:24| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15084)|
| 4:11:25| My mind's catching up with the motions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15085)|
| 4:11:28| Okay, so we've got a motion to approve the group that I just referenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15088)|
| 4:11:34| for staff recommendation by Commissioner Higgins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15094)|
| 4:11:37| seconded by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15097)|
| 4:11:40| Seeing only one like, no likes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15100)|
| 4:11:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15104)|
| 4:11:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15106)|
| 4:11:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15107)|
| 4:11:48| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15108)|
| 4:11:49| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=15109)|
