| 0:03:48| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=228)|

| 0:03:50| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| Mayor's report, just a couple of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| I want to remind everybody about the Marty Growl Dog Parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| Bring your dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| This Saturday, February 2nd, at 10 a.m., it's going to begin on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| There's prizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| There's early registration, which ends already over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| You missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| You could have saved five bucks, but the day of registration is $8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| and the proceeds are benefiting the Young-Williams Animal Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| So your extra $3 is going to a good cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| Does anybody have any wire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| Every registrant receives a doggy bag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| and you get to see the future side of the downtown dog park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| and there's lots of awards and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| and I'm all choked up at the thought about the dog parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| Also, I think you all got the notice we're going to finally be opening the skate park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| hopefully, this Thursday at 4 o'clock down at Tyson Park at the new site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=295)|
| 0:05:03| Unfortunately, there's a prediction of rain that afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=303)|
| 0:05:09| so if it rains because the site's already fairly muddy, we might postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| We hope not to because it's ready to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| and lots of people are already ready to skate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| so we'd love to get that open and ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| But, again, that's Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| If we postpone it, we will put an announcement on the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| and we will let all of you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| We'll do that by tomorrow once we get a last look at the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| I want to make one more announcement for Mayor's Report before our law director doesn't kill me for doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=332)|
| 0:05:40| but he'll be embarrassed, but this is Morris Kaiser's last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| and I do want to stop and make he's mad at me for doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| but I want to stop and make recognition of him because he has served our city in an outstanding way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| and I think everybody that's associated with him would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| I've been dealing with lawyers for a while now in lots of different contexts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| and I've learned that there's good lawyers and some not so good lawyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| and good lawyers know the legal arguments inside and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| They know the law behind what they're arguing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| and they also know the argument behind the other side's argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| They know the law of the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| so they're prepared and understand the pros and cons of their argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| and they can help you in any circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| but there's some great lawyers who can go beyond that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| because sometimes the law doesn't spell out for you clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| and sometimes it's just judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| so at the end of a long legal discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| a lot of times I find myself saying, so what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| I hear all that, but what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| And a great lawyer can help you because they not only know the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| but they have great judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| but then beyond that there's some outstanding lawyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| and they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| They know the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| They have great judgment, but they're also just good people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| and so at the end of the day, I can say, I understand the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| I understand, but is this the right thing to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| And Morris Kaiser is somebody that knows the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| has great judgment, and is a good person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| and if he tells you, hey, this is the right thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| he means it legally, you know, with wisdom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| and also because he's just a person of high character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| So Morris has come and served the city for four-plus years now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| at some personal cost to himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| and he has been outstanding in every way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| And, Morris, on behalf of the entire city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| I want to thank you for an incredible four years of serving our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=445)|
| 0:07:39| You'll never forgive me for doing that, but I thought it was important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| I'm going to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| Should we, in his honor, have a really long meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| He promises he'll be watching this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| We can work on that, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=472)|

| 0:09:45| Dr. Fox knows as much about the state's economy as anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| We're fortunate that he happens to be, his office is a mile away from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| and he's agreed to come give us a little outlook on the state's economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| and spend some time, but he's got class that begins at 945 or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=595)|

| 0:15:14| But as we always talk about, whenever we do a rezoning, it sticks with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| property, you know, even if it would change hands in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| And is the C4, is that the district that allows for the outdoor display of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=921)|
| 0:15:28| merchandise and boats and cars and stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| But without looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| And so I just wanted to bring it up and be able to talk about it publicly a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| I'd have to ask Mr. Dawson to run down a list for me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| But I do know, I know where this piece of property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| It used to be an old Fisher Tire store where they sold Fisher Tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| It was there for many, many years, right next to or across the street from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| Pizza Palace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| I think it's appropriate for that particular building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| I can't comment on the plans coming out of the architectural study because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| they haven't come out yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| But I do think that this would be consistent with that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| and what's been its historic use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| I'm going to go to Mr. Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Okay, Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| Well, I think one possibility, and I know I talked to Mr. Donaldson about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| this, is that what often comes out of one of these planning processes is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| recommendation for a new zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| So one possibility, I would say at least a moderately likely possibility, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| there will be a general rezoning along Magnolia for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| Right now, to do the business that they want to do there, they need the C4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| because it does involve auto stuff outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| My hope would be within another year or two when the plan is finished, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| going to change that somehow to get the whole of Magnolia zoned the way it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| Mr. Holquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| I guess not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| This is second reading, so a lot of times they're not here for second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| Well, I agree with Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| And I think, you know, council would just sort of keep this in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| It's one block away from the Chihuly Park and the fairgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| So I think we'll all remember more or less where it is in that last block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| And when we get to that point, general rezoning, you know, my thinking is we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| rezoning this for now, but with the understanding that we may come back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| address it comprehensively like Mr. Becker is saying in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| Yeah, my concern with that, though, is, you know, if council has in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| philosophically a general rezoning of segments of Magnolia and we have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| established business here that needs a C4 for the outdoor display of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| merchandise, you know, how do you handle that and be fair to the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| Do you rezone what grandfather in that business for the life of that business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| and then when they sell or move on, then it goes to the preferred zone that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| look at in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| I don't know if this is for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| In the event that we do rezone this area with a form-based-like code, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1077)|
| 0:18:08| particular building is one of the models for developing that form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| It is consistent with the other shapes of buildings, setbacks of buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| size of buildings that are currently along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| So it fits very well with what we're thinking might be the ultimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| dimensional requirements for a new district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| And as you recall, if we do shift to a form-based code, there's much less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| emphasis on uses and more emphasis on form and shape and scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1113)|
| 0:18:40| So we don't care as much about the outdoor display as long as they follow all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| of the design criteria that's in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| Okay, I can live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| Mr. Becker, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| I guess the other thing to remember is we've made a request to MPC to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| all the commercial zones and actually came over the controversy up at the old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| Kmart on Clinton Highway over a C4 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| And one of the things we want to look at is I think these very sort of rigid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| if you're doing outdoor stuff, we've got a zone that allows everything possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| outdoors, look for some more planning that would even go into a C4 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| So I think we're modifying our zoning code to deal with a lot of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| that you're bringing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| And I think we're doing it for all the right reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| So that's out there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| Mr. Donaldson, assuming, and it's probably a safe assumption to say that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| property owner doesn't intend to demolish the present building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| but assuming that that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| some of those property owners that have properties that have the kinds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| buildings that we think we're wanting to encourage anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| would it be appropriate in the interim to look at perhaps an overlay to get an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| extra level of review as far as demolition goes like in C1 until we're to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| point that you're referring to as far as a new code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1202)|
| 0:20:10| You know, if we're doing C4, we could end up with car lots is where I'm going with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| It would take us as long to prepare an overlay as a new form district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| And we're actually quite a ways through that planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| So we know the DNA of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| and it's just a matter of drafting the code and getting it out for public reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1226)|
| 0:20:33| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1240)|

| 0:21:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| Ms. Terry Faulkner has signed up to speak in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| If anybody would, Ms. Terry, I think I saw you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| And I believe also the developers are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| They might want to make their comments first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| My name is Chris Martin, 408 Sundown Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| I'm the attorney for the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| and actually the members of the developers are right back behind me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| We have put on each council member's desk a packet that looks like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1294)|
| 0:21:42| And if the members of council recall, this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| we refer to the zoning request here as the hole in the donut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| We are completely surrounded by commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| and what we are asking to rezone is this thumbprint R1 piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| And at the request or suggestion in the Metropolitan Planning Commission to just make it all O3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1320)|
| 0:22:09| And that made sense to us, so that was the way the application went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| Since our last appearance here at city council two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| when council gave us a unanimous vote, at Ms. Roddy's request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1338)|
| 0:22:27| we met with additional neighbors, my clients did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| and Ms. Roddy had done a good job of raising issues that those neighbors had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1352)|
| 0:22:40| primarily relating to landscaping, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| I think that there was also a question regarding lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| but I think that that issue is hopefully assuaged now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| The lighting in this type of commercial office park is all going to be down lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| It's going to be deflected down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| There's not going to be any night watchman type of lights that are going to be radiating light upward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| The attached to this behind the zoning map is a diagram that gives elevations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1384)|
| 0:23:14| And if you look at that, you will see that the elevation at North Shore Drive is 852 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1394)|
| 0:23:22| and then the elevation at the neighbors at the top is 932 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| So we actually have a very steep piece of property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| It goes up over 80 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| And there's a number one up there at the top, which corresponds to the first photograph that's attached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1413)|
| 0:23:41| and a number two, which corresponds to the second photograph that's attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| There actually is not a residence where number one is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| It's just a vacant lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| And there are two residences to the left of it that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| And as you can see, what the view is from the properties at the top actually looks over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1436)|
| 0:24:05| And if you take a look at the footprint of the two higher buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| the elevations of that footprint are 878 and 875.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| The maximum building height here would be 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| So if you added 30 feet to it, we're still over 20 feet below the rear elevation line on these lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1458)|
| 0:24:27| So these properties actually will look over these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| Now, based upon the meeting that occurred on Friday afternoon between my clients and Ms. Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| my clients agreed to kind of step up their planning about landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1480)|
| 0:24:46| And over the weekend and yesterday, they met out at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| They talked to some landscaping people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| And the plan, which is a definite by my clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| is to install a row of Leland cypress down that property line at the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| There's a 25-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| And so they will plant Leland cypress on approximately 8- to 10-foot centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1509)|
| 0:25:16| and probably somewhere between 40 trees, maybe as many as 50 trees back through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1516)|
| 0:25:24| in order to create an initial screen buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| If you look at the photographs that are attached as one and two, there obviously are trees in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| There has been some tree removal on this site for any of those of you who have driven by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| But the idea was to try and preserve as many trees at the top as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| The plan is to, once the Leland cypress is in place and the site is excavated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| depending upon the number of trees that are saved and can remain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| the developer intends to come back in and backfill an additional buffer in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| probably with ornamental trees such as magnolias and redbuds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| But until we actually get the site excavated out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| it's very difficult to tell beyond the row of Leland cypress an exact plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| of what other landscaping is going to go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| This is going to be a pretty high-end office condo development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| so there is a fairly significant budget for landscaping in this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| and they intend to do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| We expect that with the landscaping that goes in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| that they will create an augmented buffer in addition to the natural buffer that's already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1594)|
| 0:26:41| which is just a steep site by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| Please keep in mind that in addition to what is being proposed here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| we're going to provide space for the greenway to go through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| which will be an artery that will connect the Lakeshore Greenway with the Sutherland Avenue Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1615)|
| 0:27:01| That also fits perfectly within my client's plan as far as having a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| where people who work in this office park would be able to run, walk, ride a bike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| or whatever, get some exercise through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| So it should fit in very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| Other than that, I really can't add much more than what we discussed at the last city council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1642)|
| 0:27:29| unless there's any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| Ms. Peeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| I want to make a comment, but if Ms. Faulkner wants to speak to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| or if there's any opposition that wants to speak, perhaps it would be more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| if I spoke first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| I do not have any opposition signed up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| Ms. Faulkner, would you like to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| Terry Faulkner, 4178 Ridgeway Lane, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| I know you're probably all tired of hearing from me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| but I had to get up and thank the developers and Marilyn Roddy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| and Anne O'Connor from the Church of Ascension and Barbara P. Lowe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| and Jason Woodall also for introducing the residents of this Lyons Creek community to the Bearden Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| And we are delighted with the opportunity and look forward to working with them in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| and hope that we'll have council support to go to Mark Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| and ask that this neighborhood, which is important historically to the Bearden community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| as well as its proximity to the community, should logically be added into the Bearden Village Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| as well as the Bell Mead community, which is just east of Tobler Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| These are critical areas to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| And we appreciate that and hope that you'll support us not only in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| but in our effort to get private funding and help from city engineers to get some cost estimates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1735)|
| 0:29:02| for building a privately funded greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| Ms. Peele?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Well, I would like to, in a way, I'm just saying a good amen or a big ditto to Ms. Faulkner's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| because this has been a very exciting project to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| and to meet with these folks who are so interested in making this development happen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1759)|
| 0:29:27| It's a very challenged lot, as you can see, with the floodway and with the steep slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| And they have really developed an ideal plan for the least movement of earth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1773)|
| 0:29:41| that I could imagine could happen on that particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| And we are extremely excited that they have been so willing to spend so very much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| I just need to emphasize the amount of time that they have been willing to spend with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| and with the council to talk about all of the creative ideas that can occur as a result of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1798)|
| 0:30:07| So I have to really just, I cannot emphasize enough how exciting it is to come across some folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1807)|
| 0:30:16| who are so willing to spend so much time considering something that, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| the Bearden Council's interest is a much broader interest than just this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| And it really speaks to all of Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| And as Ms. Faulkner has said, it actually is going to be, I hope, the opportunity to extend the Bearden Village Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1829)|
| 0:30:38| and allow it to go further south and encompass more of the neighborhoods in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1838)|
| 0:30:45| and more of the residents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| So I just want to, on behalf of the council, they were kind enough to let me meet with them once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1847)|
| 0:30:54| I just want to say thank you to Terry and the council for letting me be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| And it's really been a pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| It is always a pleasure to work with folks who are really interested in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| and the development of the city in a very creative way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| I echo the comments of thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| The time that folks have put into plans, especially in the past 48 hours, has been extraordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| And I appreciate you taking the time tonight to detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| particularly for the residents who are watching on television tonight and who couldn't come down tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| the plantings and the elevation so that they can really get a feel of what this will look like from their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| I have a question about the detailed drawing that you provided tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| As changes have evolved, it looks like there are five buildings here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| Mr. Martin, is that the final count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| Because I know that was still evolving the last time we talked about that based on the site specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| That's the final count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Yeah, that will be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Well, again, particularly to Mr. Slade who came on Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| and spent an awful lot of time with folks there answering their questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| was very patient and sat through a lot of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| And Mrs. Pelo has worked quite a bit on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| We just thank you for making it all come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| Mayor Haslam, just a little footnote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| I just wanted to add that tonight is not the end of this subject or this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1934)|
| 0:32:22| Already Mr. Slade and his partner, Mr. Chandler, have agreed that they will meet with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1942)|
| 0:32:30| And we're very excited that Jason Whittle is going to become involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| This just all demonstrates how exciting it's been to work on the community task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| and the neighborhood task force and to see now that we have a community that is just really itching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| to get to be one of the first to take advantage of the new Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| And so this is really, I think it's just a win-win to demonstrate how we are all assisting each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1972)|
| 0:33:00| in trying to meet all the needs and the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| And I'm really excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| But I think one of the most exciting things is that Terry Faulkner is writing the history of Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| And these are actually people who have grown up in this area, who have lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| Some of them have left and have come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| And they want so much to have that history retained as a very important part of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=1997)|
| 0:33:25| So I'm just really excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| And forgive me for just talking too much about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| But, you know, when you get excited about something and something works so well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| it's something that we all want to thank everyone for having their part in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| So thank you, Marilyn, for your part in it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2020)|

| 0:35:35| Ms. Pelow, is that an old light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2137)|

| 0:35:51| denial of a variance to allow commercial driveway across from a T intersection with Pleasant Knoll Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2151)|
| 0:35:58| Appendix B, Article 5, Section 7B2B, as per site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| to construct a commercial building in a C-3 general commercial district property located at 2122 Brooks Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| to be considered with Resolution 11N, a resolution approving the appeal by John King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2169)|
| 0:36:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| We do have several folks signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| I'll take it counsel would like to hear from them first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| As is our custom, we'll hear from those in favor of the item first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| And we have one person signed up to speak in favor of that, Mr. John King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2187)|
| 0:36:33| Mayor, members of the Council, I'm John King, PO Box 2425 Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2193)|
| 0:36:40| Would it be possible perhaps to like to reserve some time to respond after those speak in opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| or at least have time to try to respond to those in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Just as a reminder, by rules, you'll have two minutes to respond after they're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2209)|
| 0:36:58| Before I get into my time, I'll start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| I'd like to pass up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| I know that Council members have a packet of material before them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| and I'm sure that packet is part of the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| so I want to make sure at least two things are in there for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2230)|
| 0:37:25| I think perhaps it's, as I've said before and before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| I think sometimes it's important to at least mention what we're not here about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| as it is to talk about what we are here about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| This is not a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| This is not a question of a particular proposed utilization of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| This is an appeal from the Board of Zoning Appeals denial of a request for variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| We ask as far as that application there was amended to state as the proposed utilization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2270)|
| 0:37:59| any purpose or anything permitted in a C3 zone, which is what the property is zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| We also amended it to simply seek one variance only, and that variance is as to a permitted driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2285)|
| 0:38:15| Mr. Stokesberry owns a lot at City Block 12480 on Brooks Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| The address is 2122 Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| He's owned that property for some period of time, and it is zoned C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| The lot has frontage on Brooks Avenue, and the lot is approximately 70 to 75 feet in width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| It has no other access to a public street other than Brooks Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| He owned that property as zoned prior to the development of a subdivision across Brooks Avenue from his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2319)|
| 0:38:47| That subdivision development included the construction of a street known as Pleasant Noe Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| Pleasant Noe Lane at that intersection is a T intersection at Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| That is, it does not cross Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| And it is directly across the street from Mr. Stokesberry's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| If you look in your packet of materials, those maps that I put in, I'm sure, are part of your packet of materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| and will show the location of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| The request is for a variance of the requirement of Article 5, Section 7B2B of the Zoning Ordinance of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2353)|
| 0:39:22| That particular section says, as related to this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| no driveway should be constructed opposite the non-continuous leg of a T intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2367)|
| 0:39:33| for a distance equal to the width of the non-contiguous leg right-of-way plus 25 feet in each direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2373)|
| 0:39:42| Requesting, as I say, a curb cut and driveway for this lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| the strict application of that provision of your zoning ordinance results in this property being essentially landlocked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2387)|
| 0:39:56| having no access to a public street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| You cannot locate a driveway on the property if you apply that ordinance as strictly stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2399)|
| 0:40:09| So if you were to comply with that requirement, you have, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| denied any driveway or any access to a public street for this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| Denial of this variance effectively denies utilization of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| And there's perhaps some legally cognizable right in the event that were to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2423)|
| 0:40:31| The section of the ordinance referred to as applied to this property prohibits driveway construction opposite that non-continuous leg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2431)|
| 0:40:41| And as readily shown by the map and as acknowledged by MPC staff members at the BZA meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2441)|
| 0:40:49| imposition of that requirement of the ordinance results in no permitted access to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2449)|
| 0:40:56| I would also note, and it's in your packet of materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| the chairman of the BZA stated after he voted against our request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| stated that this clearly was an appropriate case for a variance, that there was a hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| and that he, although voting against it, made that statement and that was his feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2471)|
| 0:41:19| He then followed that up by saying he just preferred that city council deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| The variance requested here is one that permits us to have access to a public street and, therefore, utilize our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2484)|
| 0:41:35| If you look at Article 7, Section 2C, regarding the standards for variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| and the basis upon which variances are granted, this clearly is a case for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| It's not about some economic hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| It's not about anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| It's purely and simply the only way that this gentleman can get access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| and have access to a public street so he can utilize his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| I've done this for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| I've watched a number of occasions in the past dealing with variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| I've been involved in a number of them myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| And I watch others that do this do them, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| And I would suggest to you that it's my observation that this is a type of variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| that has been in the past routinely granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| It's clearly an appropriate and necessary variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| It is not an issue of what development is ultimately to occur on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| It's not a rezoning or a zoning decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| This application meets all the standards and requirements for a variance, and I submit, therefore, it should be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| If there are any questions now, take them, or I'll wait until I come back before you at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| We have three folks, I think, signed up to speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| Evelyn Mosby, Raleigh Winn, and I think John Davis has signed up to speak against that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| Evelyn, you can come on down first, and then we'll have Mr. Winn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| My name is Evelyn Mosby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| I reside at 1024 Pleasant Knoll Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| And I would like to speak on the fact that Mr. King said that Mr. Stokesbury was not aware that a subdivision was going there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2588)|
| 0:43:18| or that the street had been constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2598)|
| 0:43:25| In May of 1997, that's when the final plaque was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2605)|
| 0:43:32| There's an instrument number on it, so that's the date that it was recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| I got to looking around today, and I tried to figure out exactly when the street went in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2618)|
| 0:43:45| and I really wasn't successful on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| But I found out that Mr. Stokesbury was the contractor that did the grading in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2627)|
| 0:43:56| So I said, well, is Jack Stokesbury the same Stokesbury Construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| So I went to the State Department of Commerce and Insurance and found out that Stokesbury Construction Company is actually owned by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2642)|
| 0:44:13| Jack Stokesbury, the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| I went to KGS, pulled up the property on Brooks Road, and found that, oh, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2658)|
| 0:44:25| I say that the grading permit was signed on 6-9-1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| Mr. Stokesbury purchased the property, both of those properties, in July of 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2671)|
| 0:44:38| And to be exact, I think it was July the 11th of 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2678)|
| 0:44:47| So him being the contractor, he was well aware that a subdivision was going over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| I was the first house to go in over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| And the contractor and developer publicized that a subdivision was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| I looked for an already built home before I decided to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| I signed down on the house plans in January of 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2705)|
| 0:45:12| It's my understanding, after speaking with the developer and the contractor, that Mr. Stokesbury purchased those two parcels of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2712)|
| 0:45:19| and he used the fill from the Pleasant Mill subdivision to fill in that property over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2719)|
| 0:45:26| So he was well aware that a subdivision was going over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| He was well aware that one was on R1 and one was on C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| And he also was well aware that there was no other outlet there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2734)|
| 0:45:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| Mr. Raleigh Winn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2744)|
| 0:45:56| To the mayor and the city council, my name is Raleigh Winn, Sr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| I live at 2205 Brooks Road since 1957.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| My house was built there in 1956.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| I moved in in 1957.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| Before I say anything, this is not anything to harm anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| I'm not here for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| I'm here for the sanity of my neighborhood that I've lived for 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| And if all the members of the Dandridge Avenue Neighborhood Watch would you please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2782)|
| 0:46:32| We, the members of Neighborhood Watch, are very concerned about this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2792)|
| 0:46:40| The reason we are so concerned, we wasn't shown the courtesy of coming to talk to our group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| and we meet every first Tuesday at the Beck Culture Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| We felt like we were slighted when something was coming to our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| Why you would put one advertisement, another advertisement comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| and they said a commercial building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| And I got pictures here that said that a car wash would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| And we definitely do not need a car wash when our young people have purchased all these beautiful homes in the lane over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2824)|
| 0:47:13| They have a car wash raising their young children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| We already having problems in East Knoxville now when the policemen can't come in to arrest people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| They're being shot at and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| Why bring something else in our neighborhood to downgrade us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2844)|
| 0:47:31| I was served in World War II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| One of the six sons of Alexander Williams, Sr. sent to this United States Army for this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2854)|
| 0:47:42| And I feel slighted because I have put my life on the block for this country, and I love this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2862)|
| 0:47:48| I love my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| We're trying to upgrade our neighborhood to cleanliness in our young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2870)|
| 0:47:56| And we, the members of Daniel J. Avenue Neighborhood Watch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| feel that this would be downgrading us to the same level that we've had years and years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2880)|
| 0:48:09| And we feel that this building or whatever this building is going to be, whatever it's planned to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| would be denied because what are those young people going to think that we've gone through all through these years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| for them to live peaceful, comfortable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| And I can stand in my living room and look directly across in this plot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| And these pictures will show you that it's got all this stuff in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| So we, the members of Daniel J. Avenue Neighborhood Watch, feel today that we've been slighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2914)|
| 0:48:41| and we want to see Knoxville grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| I was born and reared here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| And we feel tonight, with the good Lord on our side, that you will make a decision that we can keep the solitude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2927)|
| 0:48:57| the neighborhood watch that we have in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| And we stand tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| We will not bend our backs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| We pray and hope that you will realize that our community means as much to us as it means to anybody in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2946)|
| 0:49:15| And we are law-abiding citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| We want it to stay that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| I thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| I have John Davis signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| Can I, Mr. Wynn, can I ask you a question real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| Just to be clear, you actually said here that the group meets the first Tuesday every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| At the BZA in the notes, you said that there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| So in December, when this came up at BZA, and Mr. King and Mr. Stokesberry were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| you said the group meets the first Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| They never called you, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| They never called us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| So you offered them, in effect, a chance to talk to you, and they didn't follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| I was there, and that's what Mr. Wynn stated at that meeting, and you were as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| Mr. Davis, do you want to speak on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| Do I have it right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3006)|
| 0:50:13| Mr. Mayor, members of Council, John Davis, 2110 Brooks Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3013)|
| 0:50:19| I wanted to make myself available this evening because I was informed that Mr. King informed the Council that I had organized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3019)|
| 0:50:28| and was the impetus behind the opposition to his development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| And, actually, nothing could be farther from the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| As the owner of a business located just due west of Mr. Stokesberry's proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| I, in fact, would benefit from any development that he would put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| But I adamantly oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| And it's not because I want to minimize the commercial competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| One of the things that have not been mentioned is the fact that 200 yards west of Mr. Stokesberry's proposed development site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3053)|
| 0:51:01| is one of the major drop-off points and boarding sites for our school children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| This particular parcel sits adjacent of a very steep hill with limited visibility and no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3066)|
| 0:51:13| It would be impossible to set back any proposed development far enough to make this safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| If this amendment were approved, our children would be in danger every single day they are picked up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| and dropped off in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| That is the main reason that I implore you to deny this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| Mr. King, you have two more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3093)|
| 0:51:41| A couple of quick comments to the lady who first spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| I think she misunderstood what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| I never have said that Mr. Stokesberry was unaware that there was a development going across there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| He has acknowledged in the past that he did a bunch of the grading work over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| And part of the reason he was interested in doing it was to fill these lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| and make them more, if you will, susceptible to utilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| I have tremendous respect for Mr. Winn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| I've had conversations with him in the past, including this particular matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| I have a very fond regard for his son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| I certainly know some of the other people here in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| Herbert Donaldson I've known for probably in excess of 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| I know all about his history out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| I find him to be a fine gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| I see Diane Jordan, former commission member of Knox County back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| We certainly have had a great relationship with her over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| And I intend none of them any disrespect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| I would say to Mr. Davis that I don't recall having talked to a single council member about this issue before tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3165)|
| 0:53:00| with the exception of Vice Mayor Brown and Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3180)|
| 0:53:07| They were both at the BZA meeting, and I spoke to them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| I don't believe I had anything to say about Mr. Davis at all to either of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3191)|
| 0:53:18| I think I recall that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| So I don't know where his information came from that I'm running him up the pole, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| as the basis for my opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| I think the opposition is here because of their keenly felt interest in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| I simply, once again, reiterate what the situation really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| This property is zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| It was zoned that when we acquired it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| We have the right to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| And what it takes in order to be able to access the only public street that we can access is this variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3227)|
| 0:53:57| No, I didn't sit down and talk with this group of neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| I think I understood perfectly their position, and I believe you heard Mr. Davis state it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| They oppose any development on this lot, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3247)|
| 0:54:14| I don't know what there is to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| I mean, I don't know what we can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| I think we're entitled to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| It's entitled to be utilized as it is zoned properly in a C3 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3262)|
| 0:54:31| That's what we'd like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| In order to put anything on there, we have to have access to the public street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| It is impossible to get it unless there is a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| That's the situation, plain and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| That's the reason I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| That's the reason we submitted our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| I'm sorry to see a number of friends and people I've known and respected for years are on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| That just sometimes happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| I do submit to you respectfully that the request is an appropriate request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| It is one that is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| And I believe it fits all of the parameters for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| And we would, again, respectfully ask that our appeal be granted and the variance be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3315)|
| 0:55:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| Yeah, Mr. King, I'm a little concerned about this idea that you didn't think you had to talk to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3325)|
| 0:55:31| I mean, you've been around this council for a while and know that we actually believe in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| And even more importantly, I think back to a time when you and Mr. Stokesbury were doing a development in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3334)|
| 0:55:41| and there were some real roadblocks, and I frankly thought there was no solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| And then we actually sat down and talked about it, and there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| And I'm wondering what made you think that they knew everything that you were thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| and you knew everything they were thinking and didn't even have to bother to talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3351)|
| 0:56:02| Well, if that's the basis for the denial, then I hope you all would simply make that part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3362)|
| 0:56:09| I would say that, you know, everybody gets in positions where time constraints eat on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3369)|
| 0:56:18| I've had my own time constraints, and it's not necessary to go into them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| But, you know, again, I think I can detect from what was said at BZA and their position, as, again, echoed here, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3384)|
| 0:56:36| their position is we don't want any kind of commercial utilization of that property, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| You've never found anybody to say something different in public from what they say in a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| Oh, no, I wouldn't agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| I think clearly we all recognize the fact that people say something sometimes and end up doing another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| I'm not going to go there, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| But I do think in this instance, you know, it's a two-way street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3418)|
| 0:57:05| If they had really something to propose, if they wanted to come to my client and say, look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| if you'll do this, we'll support that, that didn't occur either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| So, I mean, you know, it works both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| Councilman Horquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| Mr. King, don't sit down yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| Looking back at the record from the BZA meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| the chairman pointed out at one point that since Mr. Stooksbury owns the adjacent lot to the east of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3447)|
| 0:57:34| that if he were to combine the two lots, he could create a legal entrance without having to ask for this variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| The adjoining lot is residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| He can't use access off a residential lot to access commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| Has he considered rezoning that property or applying for rezoning on that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| Rezoning which piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| The residential piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3476)|
| 0:57:57| Now, this same group that is here in opposition to this request opposed the rezoning of the piece that is currently C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3477)|
| 0:58:06| And the answer to that is no, we haven't attempted to rezone the adjoining piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3486)|
| 0:58:12| There is a different proposed utilization for that adjoining piece of property that is residential in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| Well, I was just wondering because, as Councilman Becker said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| if there had been communication between the owner and the people in the community group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3501)|
| 0:58:28| perhaps those options could have been put on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| and discussions could have ensued that investigated all the options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| and perhaps even some options that no one had considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| I think if you put the question to the group that's here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| do they want the adjoining piece of property that's owned by my client rezoned commercial C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| I think you'll get an answer that is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| Well, that may be true, but you don't know that because you haven't asked them, have you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| I'll ask them now if you want me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| I'll ask them now if you want me to, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| I don't think this is the venue for carrying on that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| I think that conversation should have happened before tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| Well, you've asked me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3545)|
| 0:59:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| I'm now reminded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| As a matter of fact, we did attempt to rezone it at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| And it was opposed and we ended up withdrawing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3559)|
| 0:59:25| And, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| But that wasn't in the context of what would happen on this adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| I can say, Councilman, if that's an issue with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| and if that's a basis upon which you want to say no to this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| and if it's a matter of sufficient interest to you that it hasn't been pursued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| then I think you can ask them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| If they're willing to say, yeah, they'll agree to rezone the adjoining piece C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| I'll withdraw this request and I'll be down there asking to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| Mr. King, I don't believe this is the proper venue for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| You can't carry on that kind of dialogue in this venue and it's not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| I didn't initiate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| Mr. Donaldson, I'm talking about the property that's presently owned, C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| I don't have my zoning regulations in front of me for the sake of argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| If I recall correctly, in certain zones you can go to a more restrictive type of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3621)|
| 1:00:30| For example, in industrial, you can't build a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| In C3, could you use C3 for residential purposes and build a new house on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| without going through a zoning process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3638)|
| 1:00:52| It's a long list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| And considering that there's residentially zoned property adjoining this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3657)|
| 1:01:03| you know, if you're making an educated guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| if the owner wanted to down zone to a residential use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| would it be reasonable to anticipate that staff would recommend something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| Rezoning this property to R1 would be consistent with both the one-year plan and the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3676)|
| 1:01:22| So there is a use that's available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| just not necessarily the use that the developer presently wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| Is that a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| It would be a use available if the property were rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3691)|
| 1:01:40| Ms. Serrati.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| Mr. Donaldson, in that same vein,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| do you have the history on the zoning of this parcel of property as C3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| It is unusual that it's surrounded by residential on all sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| and I'm curious when and under what circumstances this property was zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3713)|
| 1:02:00| We took a look at this yesterday and found a zoning map from 1964,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| which showed this property as well as the properties across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| and the properties on both sides zoned C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| So this one remains the only one that retains that C3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| Everything else has been rezoned to R1 in the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| So the history was that the whole area was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| Yeah, I believe there was an operating nursery across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| and they did their business there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| and that would have been consistent with the C3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| If I may, since the question is raised, if you, again, look at your map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3762)|
| 1:02:47| there is an adjoining piece to the west of this piece that is zoned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3767)|
| 1:02:54| but the next piece to the west on Brooks Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| and on both sides of Brooks Avenue, the one adjoining the piece to the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3777)|
| 1:03:04| and then directly across from that is all still zoned C3 also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3784)|
| 1:03:11| Ms. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| Well, just kind of following up on the question that Councilman Becker asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| and considering an earlier discussion that we had regarding a rezoning this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3798)|
| 1:03:29| and recalling some past history that we've had with Mr. Stooksbury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3809)|
| 1:03:36| this Council has had with Mr. Stooksbury regarding a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| which I believe Councilman Becker referred to in his district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| I just want to voice my agreement that I attended both BCA meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| and I was able to hear the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| and feel the spirit of the folks who are really before us tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3833)|
| 1:03:59| with their concerns about this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3839)|
| 1:04:05| You know, when we looked at the North Shore Commons development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| there was a lot of mistrust, a lot of concern, a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3850)|
| 1:04:16| But having a meeting with a developer is just a very important opportunity to gain trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3856)|
| 1:04:27| to find out where you have compromises and how things can be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| And so I just regret that Mr. Stooksbury made a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3871)|
| 1:04:37| It's his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| It's his decision to have made the move toward the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3878)|
| 1:04:45| to want to talk with him about how he could best utilize his piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| And I personally just feel very disappointed that he hasn't taken that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| It was obvious at the first BCA meeting that there was opposition to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| and it was obvious why there's opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| And now we've had a month go by, and knowing that there was going to be an appeal to this Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3903)|
| 1:05:10| and yet there has been absolutely nothing done to try to communicate with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3910)|
| 1:05:17| or to mitigate the sense that this was not going to be a good land use for this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3917)|
| 1:05:24| and for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| So I just simply feel obligated to, somebody said a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| if that's the way you feel, put it on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| So I guess that's what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| That's for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| And that's what's going through my mind at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3934)|
| 1:05:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| I guess I'm going to get on my high horse for a second here and think about how Council operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| And this is a little bit following up on Mr. Schwartz's comments about what the uses of this property are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| And it's clear, you know, if you look at the sector plan, the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3952)|
| 1:05:57| everybody knows this property should be residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| And I guess I have sort of two thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| As a policy, we probably need to be a little more active in down zoning property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3963)|
| 1:06:09| When we're making plans and we know property should be residential, it's a very controversial topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3969)|
| 1:06:15| but I want to throw that on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| I also want to throw one out, since we're having the budget retreat on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| that, you know, avoiding situations like this takes really good planning work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| seeing these things in advance and working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| I know the mayor brought up the issue a couple of meetings ago about how much we're asking MPC to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| I think some of that's a budget issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| And to say, if we want to avoid fights like this, I think one way we do it is we do do funding better for the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=3995)|
| 1:06:43| so that we get better planning, that we avoid these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| And I think that's a good investment in the long run for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| It's a little high horse preachy, but I thought I'd do that while the opportunity was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| Mr. Hoekstra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| Well, I appreciate Councilman Becker's comments, and I tend to concur with them, and Councilman Peehaw's comments also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4015)|
| 1:07:02| And I want to make sure that my comments earlier, observing the record from the BZA meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4022)|
| 1:07:09| and what the chairman said, that I was not advocating that the two parcels be combined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4029)|
| 1:07:16| and zone the same, et cetera, zone C3 for commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| What I was saying is there are obviously options that have not been explored in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| and have not been vetted or dialogued with the neighborhood, between the neighborhood and the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4046)|
| 1:07:35| And since the property owner, going back to what Mr. King said, he said this is a two-way street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| Well, sure it's a two-way street, but you and your client are the ones that are asking for something, not the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4060)|
| 1:07:49| They're having to react to something that you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| And so the proper and appropriate thing to do and what this council is used to seeing applicants do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4072)|
| 1:07:59| when they handle these kinds of concerns well is go to the community and start that dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4079)|
| 1:08:07| And, again, as Mr. Donaldson pointed out, and Mr. Becker said also, it's surrounded by R1 zone properties completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4087)|
| 1:08:15| This particular parcel is completely surrounded by properties that are zoned R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4095)|
| 1:08:22| It borders on spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| I don't think it quite fits that definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| I could be wrong about that, but it's completely surrounded by R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| And so you've never gone to the community and said let's talk about all the options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| And that down zoning is clearly the option that seems one that should be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4116)|
| 1:08:42| So I can't see voting in favor of this request or this appeal, especially not under the circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4122)|
| 1:08:52| when that dialogue has not occurred and there's been no attempt to have that dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| You know, I certainly understand that there are some hard feelings out there among members of the public about meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| that should have occurred that might not have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| But, you know, personally, and I would assume that for the rest of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| something like that's not going to be held against any applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| It would have been nice, sure, had they met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| but that's not one of the elements that we're to take into consideration in deciding whether or not to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4161)|
| 1:09:28| or disapprove this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| I'm familiar with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| I was friends with the late John Drury, who just lived right down the street on Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4172)|
| 1:09:39| I know where this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| I went out and saw it and remembered from when it came up before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| But, you know, like I said, you've got to put aside any issues that you have about something that was said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4184)|
| 1:09:53| not said, a meeting that occurred or didn't occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| and you've got to weigh the appeal on its own merits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| and the elements of whether or not you're going to grant something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| At this point, I'd like to ask Mr. Swanson to refresh our memories, collective memories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| on the reasons why you can or cannot approve this type of appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4211)|
| 1:10:17| Well, what you have here is an appeal from the denial of a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4217)|
| 1:10:23| And in this instance, you have city council acting not in its legislative capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| where you have almost complete discretion as to what you think maybe the best thing to do is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| but your discretion is limited by the standards that are set out in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| And in this case, the standards for variances are set out in Article 7, Section 2 of the city code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4238)|
| 1:10:45| and those standards are set out in Subsection C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| Let me just read you what the standards are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| They are, first of all, variances shall be granted only where special circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| or conditions such as exceptional narrowness, topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| or sighting fully described in the findings of the board do not apply generally in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| Number two, variances shall not be granted to allow a use otherwise excluded from the particular district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4268)|
| 1:11:15| in which requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| That probably does not apply in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| Number three, for reasons fully set forth in the findings of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| the aforesaid circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4284)|
| 1:11:30| would deprive the applicant of any reasonable use of his land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| Mere loss in value shall not justify a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| There must be a deprivation of beneficial use of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| Four, any variance granted under the provisions of this section shall be the minimum adjustment necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| for the reasonable use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| And five, the granting of any variance is in harmony with the general purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| and intent of this ordinance and will not be injurious to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| detrimental to the public welfare, or in conflict with the comprehensive plan for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4320)|
| 1:12:06| Also in Subsection D, there are certain requirements set out for the granting of a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| and those requirements that you must follow with regard to requirements for granting of a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| include four things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| One, that the granting of the variance will not be contrary to the public interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| Number two, that the literal enforcement of the ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4342)|
| 1:12:28| Number three, that by granting the variance contrary to the provisions of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| the spirit of the ordinance will be observed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| And number four, that by granting the variance, substantial justice will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| Those are the standards that you must apply in making your decision in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4361)|
| 1:12:47| You've heard both sides of this argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| and you have to decide based on those standards what your vote would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| And I really do appreciate the comments from my council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| I sat here very quietly because I wanted to hear their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| I know Mr. King knows exactly how I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| Let me address a couple of things before I make my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| And I see there's a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| But, you know, first off, I want to commend Raleigh Winn on what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4392)|
| 1:13:18| I think it was very insightful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| I want to commend Ms. Mosby on her great research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| She and I have talked a couple of times today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| I commend Ms. Gater on what she has done with her research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| and what this whole neighborhood has done to stand up for itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| to stand up for what really actually is a historic neighborhood for my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| Within a stone's throw here, there are homes that were built by African-American builders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| that were designed by African-American architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| We've got some of our retired educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| I see Ms. Lois Kelly out there who is going to be celebrating 100 years birthday here real soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| She and her husband, one of the first dentists here, Dr. Kelly, was in a stone's throw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| One of these days, some of these homes and houses hopefully will be put on some historic register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| to recognize not only the contributions of African-Americans in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| but also the historic value of those homes and who lived there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| and what they brought to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| Let me also say with regards to Mr. Davis's comments earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| I know exactly where they came from, and I must disagree respectfully with Attorney King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4453)|
| 1:14:18| Mr. Davis's name was invoked at the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| He called it this council, but his name was invoked at the BZA with regards to potential plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4460)|
| 1:14:26| Why Mr. King invoked it, I'm not sure of his intent, but his name was invoked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| so I understand why he came here to speak up for himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| I must also respectfully agree with Attorney King's assertion regarding Mr. Stooksbury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4473)|
| 1:14:39| and his knowledge of the residential development across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4479)|
| 1:14:45| I was there at the BZA meeting, I've been there twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| and I was also there at the rezoning request before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| In none of those situations did Mr. Stooksbury, in my recollection, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| make it clear that he understood there was a residential development going on across the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| In fact, I think when asked the question, he, in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| stated that he didn't know there was a residential development going on across the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4506)|
| 1:15:11| before he bought this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| I was sitting there in the audience when the question was asked, and Mr. King was at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| So the impression he left was that he bought this property before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| and without any knowledge that there was going to be any residential development immediately across the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| And then we hear and find out at this 11th hour that he did the grading of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4525)|
| 1:15:32| He used some of the dirt and some of the stuff he took out of there to fill this property across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| You know, he was intimately involved there with the grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| I'm sure he saw those plans about what was going to go on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| and he decided to invest in the property across the street and buy those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| He had knowledge of what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| He knew that the development was across there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| I think that's why he went initially to get the changes on it for the residential piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4549)|
| 1:15:56| So, you know, I'm not sold on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| He didn't know, and now I hear he did know, but it makes no difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| I think it makes a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| You know, I think he knew, and I think he's put himself in whatever posture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| because he purchased that property with full knowledge of what was going on across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| and the potential problems he would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| Let me also say that there is a reasonable use for this property that can make Mr. Stooksbury some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4574)|
| 1:16:22| He's only residential and built some nice houses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| Built some nice houses on both of those pieces of property that would fit within the character of that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| There are great homes in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| He could have a great reasonable use and build nice properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| and have an economic windfall and benefit from doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| and it could be a very good use for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| Having said that, and to say to this neighborhood, you know, I sit here very proudly as your councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4602)|
| 1:16:50| I'm very proud to serve you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| You guys did a lot of hard work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| You came out, and when you look at these folks, look at these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| They're not my age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| They're not Joe Bailey's age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| They're not Sam Anderson's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4620)|
| 1:17:01| Well, I know Sam is pretty old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| But my point is these folks are standing up and fighting for their neighborhood, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| and these folks are people who deserve to be recognized in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4629)|
| 1:17:14| Mr. Stooksbury wouldn't be denied any reasonable use of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| He could build on this property and build some residential homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| So at this juncture, I'm going to make a motion at the appeal which would grant this variance be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4646)|
| 1:17:27| In reviewing the standards under which we review requests for variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| I do not believe that this situation qualifies for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4651)|
| 1:17:35| There is no real special circumstance here which calls for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4655)|
| 1:17:39| This lot is not an exceptionally irregular lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| It is not unusually narrow or steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| The lot is approximately 75 feet wide and more than 100 feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4665)|
| 1:17:50| There is really nothing at all exceptional about the topography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| or the seating of this lot which would require a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| In my view, it would create a real hazard to grant this variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| Locating a driveway immediately across from a T-intersection would create additional dangers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| to traffic turning from Pleasant Knoll Lane onto Brooks Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| and from Brooks Avenue onto Pleasant Knoll Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| as well as to traffic entering or exiting from the proposed driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| There is a reason that our regulations generally prohibit driveways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| from being situated immediately opposite a T-intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| It is because it creates a dangerous traffic situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| Under these circumstances, I believe that granting the proposed variance would be injurious to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4710)|
| 1:18:35| by creating an additional unnecessary traffic hazard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4715)|
| 1:18:39| and it would be detrimental to the public welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| Because granting this variance would be contrary to the public interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| I move that this appeal be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| I'll re-second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| Seeing no further lights, are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| Based on Mr. Swanson's comment, I think I need to further clarify what I said previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4734)|
| 1:19:00| I'm going to vote against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| but it's not based on the fact that the developer didn't meet with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4741)|
| 1:19:07| What I was saying is I don't think they exhausted all of their options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| and proved to this council that there are no reasonable options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4751)|
| 1:19:17| and that the hardship is clearly what a hardship would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| It is defined under the law, and that's my basis for voting against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| not because of whether they met with someone or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| Now we're ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4772)|
| 1:19:33| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| The motion, actually, the motion was to deny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| and so the motion, the appeal is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4787)|
| 1:19:56| 11A, a resolution respectfully requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| and urging the state legislature to modify the Convention Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| and Tourism Development Financing Act of 1998| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| so as to allow the city to obtain a significant recapture of sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| and use taxes as contemplated by the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| Mr. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| Just briefly, the Convention Center is something that everyone here inherited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| when we came into office, and thanks to former State Senator Brett Gilbert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| some legislation was passed in Nashville when he was still a member of the State Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4828)|
| 1:20:35| Well, the time for the formula that really helped the city out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4835)|
| 1:20:43| in helping pay down the indebtedness on the Convention Center has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| And not only is the city helping pay down the Convention Center debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4848)|
| 1:20:54| our friends at the county are too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| So paying this down faster benefits not just the city but county government as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4856)|
| 1:21:04| I certainly realize there are, you know, lean budget times for all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4864)|
| 1:21:09| but it never hurts to ask, and that's the purpose of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4869)|
| 1:21:15| to hopefully have our friends in the Nashville legislative delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| reinstitute the formula that originally existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4880)|
| 1:21:26| The city has done great things since the Convention Center has been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4886)|
| 1:21:31| Mass General Store, movie theater, more shops on Gate Street, on Union,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4891)|
| 1:21:38| just new development throughout the CBID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| And that was the purpose of this legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| You build a Convention Center, and the state's going to help out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| and return some of that sales tax to help pay it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| The city has done its part, and the city's lived up to what it was going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| in helping revitalize downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| and hopefully the state legislature will give this serious and due consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| Excuse me, Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| I wanted to add my name as a sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4931)|
| 1:22:12| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4932)|
| 1:22:13| If we're going to do that, I'd like to be added as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| Mine too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| Hulquist, Woodhull, Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| Make it for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| Just all of council, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| That sort of foretells the vote here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| As we all hang in suspense, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| Now we know why you're mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| I can count those votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| I can count those votes incredibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| We can't pass here, can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4959)|
| 1:22:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4960)|
| 1:22:41| 11B, a resolution approving an agreement with Pew and Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| for the audit of the financial books and records of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| for fiscal year 2007-2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| 11E, a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a quick claim deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| to George S. Dykeman III for one parcel of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| located at 2517 Parkview Avenue within the city limits of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4987)|
| 1:23:13| pursuant to the homemaker program for a contract price of $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5002)|

| 1:23:28| 11F, a resolution approving a tax increment financing amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| to the Jackson Depot Redevelopment and Urban Renewal Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| Any questions or comments on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| Dr. Lyons has provided to Council tonight a graph showing a history of our past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5022)|
| 1:23:48| TIF projects and I believe is prepared to just kind of give us some background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| on this project and why it has been recommended to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5038)|
| 1:23:59| This project, we took through the usual process that we have described in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| which is internally working with Mr. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| We've reviewed the application and then gotten some help from a bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| but not one associated with the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| to verify that the project would not happen without the TIF, the but-for question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| And we got strong assurance that this project would not be feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5059)|
| 1:24:25| and would not be possible without the TIF financing component of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| The next major question on that is the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| why is this in the public interest to get involved and have this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| And we feel that this is a really key project in helping us pursue our expansion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| downtown to the north and to the east and to the old city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| and help us provide connectivity toward the downtown north area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| in our ring of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| But also, this one provides a different price point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| This one will be used for rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| It will provide a diversity of housing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| It will be much more affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| And this is the first one of these we've been able to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| And we know that David Dewhurst and Mark Hines are here with the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| and Don Peterson with KCDC, if people have any specific questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5109)|
| 1:25:14| But we are particularly enthusiastic about this one for the reason that we're getting beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5114)|
| 1:25:20| the pure condominium market in the core of downtown and moving out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5120)|
| 1:25:24| and providing some more residential options, but in essence, expanding downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5124)|
| 1:25:30| Yeah, I'll just follow up with it and say that I did have the opportunity to tour the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| with the developer, walked inside, saw what it's going to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| what the vision is for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| It does appeal to me that there is a developer willing to take a risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| and provide some housing at a different price point in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| I think that's one of the concerns is that we're sort of a victim of our own success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| and the price per square foot downtown has become unreachable for some folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5153)|
| 1:25:57| And this being apartments on the front end, I think, will be more affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| for a wider economic range of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| And then I guess is it in six years that perhaps the apartments might convert to condominiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| that again they would be smaller units, that it's anticipated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| depending on what the market conditions are at that time, that they would again be more affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| than some of the condominiums that we're looking at on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| So for that reason, I feel like this is a good proposal for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5182)|
| 1:26:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5187)|
| 1:26:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| I, too, had the pleasure of touring the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| It was very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| One thing I would point out that on the amount of TIFFs compared to the earlier TIFFs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5192)|
| 1:26:38| that this council has approved, this is right in the middle range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| It's not the smallest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| It's definitely not the largest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| It's right there in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| It's not some big handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| It's putting people in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| It's getting people out on the street, and it's supporting the downtown businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| and hopefully will bring new downtown businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| So I plan to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| Well, I just, for all of the reasons Dr. Lyons and everyone else has stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| I would certainly echo that I agree with all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| But this afternoon in thinking about this, it was one other thing that came to my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| When we came to Sutherland Avenue, just off Sutherland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| to have the wonderful announcement that JFG had determined that they would expand their facility there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5242)|
| 1:27:28| and continue to this New Orleans business would continue to operate out of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| I thought that was extremely exciting for us and a very big win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| We can almost thank Katrina for part of their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| But it was so good to know that something that has always been a part of our historic skyline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5262)|
| 1:27:49| was going to continue to be a part of our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| And then when I saw the plans that had been presented by the developer, I was very excited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5272)|
| 1:27:59| not just because they were going to be reasonably priced units or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| but really excited to see that the skyline will not lose that very familiar sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5284)|
| 1:28:10| And so I just appreciate the whole consideration of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5290)|
| 1:28:14| and what I believe is going to be there once again for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| I'm glad you pointed that out, Ms. Pelow, because this really closes the circle on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| It's one great thing when you get to retain a business and have them move, as has happened on Sutherland with JFG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5303)|
| 1:28:29| But then that building, their older building, gets put into a more suitable use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| that obviously wouldn't work again as an effective manufacturing plant for coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| But now with a lot of creativity and hard work and imagination, it works for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5318)|
| 1:28:43| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5323)|
| 1:28:44| And having been part of a family that has rather lost its presence that was once so visible in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5324)|
| 1:28:51| I just feel that when we can retain these parts of our history, it's important for us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5331)|
| 1:28:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| I would add one other thing for everybody and those watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| The sheet that we've passed out, we keep this updated now on the Department of Policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| and Communications website so folks can check on all the TIFs and including the new ones as they come on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5347)|
| 1:29:12| and they're all totaled and the funds are aggregated and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| So I just wanted folks to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5358)|
| 1:29:19| Councilman Huckless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5360)|
| 1:29:21| I'm going to support this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| I think it's important that we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| We set a precedent, we set a pattern for providing gap financing for projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5367)|
| 1:29:33| through the provision of TIF financing for downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5373)|
| 1:29:37| We've taken a different approach on the south waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| where all the TIF dollars are going into public infrastructure supporting private development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5380)|
| 1:29:46| but that's not exactly a greenfield, but it's a brownfield redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| where you have to create new infrastructure in order to make it all work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| whereas here the infrastructure is already in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| but you have old buildings that are very challenging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| especially considering the demands that we put on them through building codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| and building inspection and all that and all the hoops that they have to jump through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| And I appreciate Mr. Dewhurst and his partner's investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| and by my estimation and looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| I think I only see three that I recognize as Dewhurst and Dewhurst-related projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5416)|
| 1:30:22| and they're, I believe, out of all the nearly $19 million in TIF financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| we're talking less than $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| And, of course, as pointed out here, that $19 million leverages total nearly $127 million in private investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5429)|
| 1:30:38| and I didn't calculate the private investment on all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| Mr. Dewhurst has three projects, but for all that he's invested in downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5441)|
| 1:30:46| I think this is a reasonable contribution that we can make on the public side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| given the difficulty of these older building renovations and restorations, those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5450)|
| 1:30:56| So I'm going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5461)|
| 1:31:02| I was going to say for all the reasons stated earlier, I'm going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5462)|
| 1:31:07| I've seen the layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5467)|
| 1:31:08| I've met with Mr. Hines and Mr. Dewhurst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| I'm particularly excited that we're putting a new product out downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| a new product that will bring, I think, some new individuals down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| maybe even bridge the gap between UT and downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| I can envision some students there, grad students, maybe moving to these apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| And we've talked about when we first started dealing with development of downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| how to get some of those folks from UT over and hopefully living downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| I think this may be a good way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| So I commend these gentlemen on putting this on the table, and I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| And I think that, as Mr. Lyons said, it really helps close out that loop there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| and I'm particularly excited that it puts another product on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| Thanks a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| Let me just make – I try to talk too much these days, but let me make one quick comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| and I think everybody knows there's a lot of political controversy around TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| and I think that's a great question, and the questions that folks ask, I think, are worthy ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5516)|
| 1:32:00| But what I want to assure you is we're only going to do these in the development districts that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| We're only going to do them even then when they meet the but-for test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| But for this help, we won't be doing it, and we're not just taking the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| this isn't just, you know, the developers came and said, well, if you don't do this, we can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| We're getting a non-involved financial institution to come and say, well, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| This deal is not financeable without the TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| So we're not just taking the developers' words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| We're verifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| And then the point, Rob, that you brought up, we really are working to narrow the length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5546)|
| 1:32:30| and the percentage of the investment that comes through the TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| So we're working hard to do that, and it's downtown, and it becomes more successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| Hopefully we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5558)|
| 1:32:39| But I want to assure you we're very sensitive to not letting TIFs get out of control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5559)|
| 1:32:44| but we still feel like they're an incredibly valuable tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| and we don't want to see the good ones thrown out with the bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| So I'll stop right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5572)|

| 1:35:07| in just commenting that improving the signalization is important not only in one or two areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5707)|
| 1:35:13| and I don't know how these, as you and I have discussed, were selected to be the first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5713)|
| 1:35:20| but I really want to emphasize the importance of some consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5720)|

| 1:35:45| 11L, a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a change order dated January 17, 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5745)|
| 1:35:51| to agreement number C070127, Waste Connections of Tennessee, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5751)|
| 1:35:58| to increase the annual contract price from $79,169.10 to $97,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5758)|
| 1:36:05| to compensate the contractor for additional pickups not covered in the original contract price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5765)|

| 1:36:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| Did everybody get two copies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| No difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| That's why it costs so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| Ms. Pena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5781)|
| 1:36:22| Is this contract involving just the fact that there is a little bit more pickup required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5782)|
| 1:36:30| Are we going to include some other items that have not been included previously in that pickup?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5790)|
| 1:36:38| No, this is just additional pickups for the city, I think, 40 city-owned facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| In other words, there was more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| There was more trash here than you planned, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| But, here again, I think some of us are very interested in some of that pickup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5810)|
| 1:36:58| including some other items in the recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| This is just another chance to make a speech about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| In fact, I paid my little bill for recycling the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| and my husband and I both agreed after they wouldn't take all of our mixed paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5829)|
| 1:37:15| that we thought it was just easier to go to the recycling center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| So, I would just love to see us be a little bit more inclusive with those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| And I think Ms. Roddy made a comment about that just the other day as well, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| Yeah, I've been trying to set up a contract for pickup of recycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| and I can't get a bin to save my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| I have called three times and been quite patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| Oh, well, you know, some of us just have been around here a long time and collect things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| and we have old bins, which we are now using for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| So, it will work, but they just only are very picky about what they want to remove from your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5869)|
| 1:37:55| In her case, it might be the caller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| So, maybe Patrick should call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| Oh, I was about to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| I noticed Mr. King writing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| So, I have a feeling that the bin fairy will be showing up real soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5888)|
| 1:38:13| Pauline, you may be in luck, but you may still have to go to the recycling center also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| because they won't take everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5899)|

| 1:38:26| and encouraging the professional staff of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5906)|

| 1:38:42| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| Mr. Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| Mr. Donaldson, you said the other day that these are relatively easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| Do you still stand by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| It means you're getting so many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| Timing is pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| We're just rolling from one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| This one's a little more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| This is the street that Jack Sharp lives on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5939)|
| 1:39:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| More urgent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5945)|
| 1:39:06| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5946)|

| 1:39:09| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| 11AA, a resolution requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| and encouraging the legislature of the State of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| to permit the Tennessee Responsible Vendor Act of 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| as codified at TCA 57-5-601 to sunset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5961)|
| 1:39:27| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| Mr. Holland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5969)|
| 1:39:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| One of the reasons that Councilman Roddy and I put this forward is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| for one, they have such a short legislative session this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| and, plus, I can't speak for Councilman Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| but I just feel like that this was not a good piece of legislation for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5982)|
| 1:39:48| It sort of ties our hands in portion to law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| and I think we need to encourage the state legislature to let it sunset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5992)|
| 1:39:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| I think this is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6000)|
| 1:40:01| I was actually going to ask the question about why it wasn't on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| I mean, I always think the process is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| You let it sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6007)|
| 1:40:08| A few more people who had it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6008)|
| 1:40:09| but it feels like there's a worry about the session being short enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| that the horse is out of the barn in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| Is that roughly accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| It did come up as a question at the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| and I serve as this council's representative over to that board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| and that board wanted to know whether or not they should advocate for this being allowed to sunset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6030)|
| 1:40:36| and the MDC wanted to follow the lead of the county beer board and the city beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| And when I called our beer board chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| and we realized that the next meeting wasn't until the end of February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| and the governor's pushing for this really tight session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| we were concerned that action might be taken before we could have a chance to advocate what our opinion might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6048)|
| 1:40:54| So that's why we pushed it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6058)|

| 1:41:42| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| I just wanted to say for the record, I see Mr. Seymour is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| This actually impacts the neighborhood that was just here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| They have met with the neighborhood, and the neighborhood understands what's going on, which I'm glad to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6110)|
| 1:41:57| One of the things that we have discussed, and I didn't mind putting this on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| is that we would like to see, especially those in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| these types of developments spread across all of Knoxville and not just in one particular district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6124)|
| 1:42:10| And so we don't mind being the lead, but we don't want to be the only dog at the show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| And we appreciate you guys reaching out to that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| and meeting with the damaged neighborhood folk and getting their understanding and clearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6137)|
| 1:42:23| And I think it's going to be a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| But, as I've said before, I don't look forward to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| and don't expect to hear about it anymore in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| And we're going to talk about that a little bit at the budget retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| We're going to have a session talking about kind of where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| everything related to the 10-year plan and geography, et cetera, because I know that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6155)|
| 1:42:40| How that's going to impact the other five districts, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| We are going to talk about that and the need, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| So, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| Councilman Hulkless, then I'll come back to Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| Just on this particular rezoning, that was related to a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| a residential project that Helen Ross McNabb was proposing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6177)|
| 1:43:01| And I know that there was another one they were looking at doing in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6181)|
| 1:43:05| And the grant application for the one in South Knoxville was unsuccessful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080129?start=6185)|
