| 2:49:33| because we do worry that eventually people will be buying homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10173)|
| 2:49:36| in the subdivision with expectations that may or may not be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10176)|
| 2:49:41| I think they hear us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10181)|
| 2:49:43| I hope they'll update their materials as they go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10183)|
| 2:49:45| but we have shared the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10185)|
| 2:49:47| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10187)|
| 2:49:49| The applicant can choose to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10189)|
| 2:49:52| and include all of the amenities that they are marketing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10192)|
| 2:49:55| but it will be maintained from the private side, not the public side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10195)|
| 2:50:00| So if they wanted to go forward and say, you know what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10200)|
| 2:50:02| we're going to go ahead and we're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10202)|
| 2:50:04| all of the recreational areas and installation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10204)|
| 2:50:07| and it's just going to become a part of our HOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10207)|
| 2:50:10| they could come back and offer that up as an alternative, too, to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10210)|
| 2:50:18| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10218)|
| 2:50:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10220)|
| 2:50:22| To go along with what Commissioner Jay said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10222)|
| 2:50:24| so would it be possible that we could say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10224)|
| 2:50:28| you could donate that park for the preserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10228)|
| 2:50:31| and then at some point if the developer or the homeowners decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10231)|
| 2:50:36| they wanted to raise the money to make a more functional park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10236)|
| 2:50:41| they could do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10241)|
| 2:50:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10243)|
| 2:50:45| But once a landowner donates a piece of land over to Legacy Parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10245)|
| 2:50:49| it is the property of Legacy Parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10249)|
| 2:50:52| and it's infinitely harder if then they go back and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10252)|
| 2:50:56| hey, we want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10256)|
| 2:50:58| Now, they could raise all the money donated to Legacy Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10258)|
| 2:51:00| and build out their own park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10260)|
| 2:51:02| I think the difference in this is becoming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10262)|
| 2:51:04| is it a public park that everyone has access to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10264)|
| 2:51:07| Could John Schoonmaker go there and walk his toy poodle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10267)|
| 2:51:11| Or is it a private park because John doesn't live there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10271)|
| 2:51:15| I think that's the big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10275)|
| 2:51:17| They could certainly develop it privately and call it a great amenity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10277)|
| 2:51:20| and keep it for their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10280)|
| 2:51:23| The key, obviously, for them is let's get a donation of land for the value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10283)|
| 2:51:28| but let's also pull in a third party that might help develop something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10288)|
| 2:51:32| that we may or may not do ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10292)|
| 2:51:36| Once you give away land, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10296)|
| 2:51:38| it ain't yours to come back and do anything with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10298)|
| 2:51:47| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10307)|
| 2:51:53| We are now to announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10313)|
| 2:51:57| I didn't know that was on here, but I'm being told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10317)|
| 2:52:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10324)|
| 2:52:05| I just wanted to recognize that on Thursday of this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10325)|
| 2:52:09| our illustrious law director has his birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10329)|
| 2:52:14| Happy birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10334)|
| 2:52:18| I don't know the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10338)|
| 2:52:19| Forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10339)|
| 2:52:20| I'm just going down the row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10340)|
| 2:52:21| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10341)|
| 2:52:22| I'd like to go last if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10342)|
| 2:52:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10343)|
| 2:52:24| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10344)|
| 2:52:28| Go to the next one while I collect my thoughts here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10348)|
| 2:52:31| Third time's a charm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10351)|
| 2:52:32| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10352)|
| 2:52:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10354)|
| 2:52:36| I just remind everybody, thank you all for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10356)|

| 2:52:41| please see your syllabus before you leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10361)|
| 2:52:43| Our junior commissioners will be here on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10363)|
| 2:52:46| It is happening, and they have their orientation session next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10366)|
| 2:52:51| between 3.30 and 5.00.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10371)|
| 2:52:54| Since I do not represent any district that will have a beer permit application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10374)|
| 2:52:58| I'll be over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10378)|
| 2:53:00| But we will get an opportunity before the commission meeting to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10380)|
| 2:53:03| everybody come over and meet with your junior commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10383)|
| 2:53:06| and then we'll welcome them to their first session on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10386)|

| 2:53:40| That's a Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10420)|
| 2:53:41| That is a Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10421)|
| 2:53:44| I need to get an e-mail out on that one, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10424)|

| 2:54:45| No, they provide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10485)|
| 2:54:46| Thank you, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10486)|
| 2:54:47| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10487)|
