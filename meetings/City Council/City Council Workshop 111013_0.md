| 0:00:00| We'll go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=0)|
| 0:00:27| I'd like to get your attention, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=27)|
| 0:00:29| And welcome to the South Waterfront Pedestrian Bridge discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=29)|
| 0:00:35| And as usual, I'd like to begin with an invocation and the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=35)|
| 0:00:42| And I'd like to ask Mayor Brown if he would lead us in the invocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=42)|
| 0:00:46| and Councilman Pavlis if you would lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=46)|
| 0:00:49| Please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=49)|
| 0:00:51| Let's bow our heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=51)|
| 0:00:52| Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for this another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=52)|
| 0:00:56| We ask that you would go with us and guide us as we seek to do the business of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=56)|
| 0:01:02| We ask a special blessing upon those who are less fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=62)|
| 0:01:07| Forgive us for all of our sins and thank you for all of your blessings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=67)|
| 0:01:10| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=70)|
| 0:01:12| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=72)|
| 0:01:19| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=79)|
| 0:01:31| Ms. Wilson, if you'd call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=98)|
| 0:01:39| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| Councilman Dela Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=100)|
| 0:01:42| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=102)|

| 0:01:48| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=109)|
| 0:01:50| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| Okay, we're going to go ahead and begin and have a report and discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| regarding the South Waterfront University of Tennessee Pedestrian Bicycle Bridge Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=121)|
| 0:02:08| And Dave Hill, who's the director of the South Waterfront Project, is with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| Welcome, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Thank you, Vice Mayor Bailey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| and thank you, council members, for taking your time for the workshop tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| I wanted to just provide some brief introductory notes in terms of what we're trying to accomplish here for the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=141)|
| 0:02:29| and then turn it over to the consultant team to actually present the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=149)|
| 0:02:36| And before we start, it was unfortunate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| but we just found out a few minutes ago that there was a video failure in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| We were hoping to project some slides so that you could look at them on the monitors, and that's not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=164)|
| 0:02:50| So we're going to have to work from the boards that you see over to my right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=170)|
| 0:02:57| And I think as the consultant team goes through, if somebody needs to point to something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| they'll just walk up and kind of discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| or have somebody come up and point to certain items, if need be, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=186)|
| 0:03:14| First of all, I wanted to say that we're working within the confines of the Lowering Associates contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=194)|
| 0:03:21| It's a consultant team of five members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| It was authorized by city council in 2010, in October 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| The contract was a little over $371,000 to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| The work completed so far, we have spent $220,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| The federal design grant was, including the local match, was an amount of $666,900, $666,900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=221)|
| 0:03:53| So there's still $295,600 available for future bridge design work under that grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=233)|
| 0:04:04| The team has been working on the design now for approximately a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| and this is the first product containing their design recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| and it was presented at a public open house on Monday for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| So this is the first public release of the recommendations of the consultant team so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| Before we showed the design publicly, there was a significant amount of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=266)|
| 0:04:33| and coordination work with the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| and ultimately that led to the university endorsing the product that you see before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=277)|
| 0:04:44| We very much appreciate UT's willingness to work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| It took a lot of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| There was a lot of discussion on how to coordinate with the UT campus plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| or master plan update that was adopted by the university in June of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=297)|
| 0:05:04| and so we knew that if we didn't have some workable solution with the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| it was going to be a tough sell to get the bridge moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| Tonight, the workshop is really intended to brief City Council on the design recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| and this is really kind of a signal that we're at a stopping point before additional commitments are needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| or requested of City Council before we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| So our intent really is we are preparing to hand over the recommended design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=331)|
| 0:05:38| to the new incoming mayoral administration and to the new city council that will be in office right after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=338)|
| 0:05:50| or near the end of this year and the start of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| There was a printed document that I gave to each of the council members called a draft design program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=355)|
| 0:06:02| That was a summary of the different kinds of work that had led to the recommended design that we'll show tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=362)|
| 0:06:15| It contains interview results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| There are analyses ranging from topographic to different kinds of connectivity objectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=377)|
| 0:06:27| and different kinds of options that were evaluated as the conceptual design was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| The one thing I do want to make clear, the bridge location and alignment was part of the contract as assigned to Lowry & Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=393)|
| 0:06:44| It is a direct result of the adopted 2006 South Waterfront Vision Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| and I just wanted to recap what the objectives were in terms of why we located the bridge in its particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=410)|
| 0:06:58| The first idea was to connect to the heart of the university campus for accessibility purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=418)|
| 0:07:07| and also for economic development reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| We definitely view the university and the campus at UT Knoxville to be an economic engine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=430)|
| 0:07:17| that we hope to see be able to move more freely back and forth across the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=437)|
| 0:07:25| We also looked at strategic spacing relative to the Henley and Gay Street bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| So if you're looking at a 750-acre redevelopment district, having multiple access points was a big part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=450)|
| 0:07:39| And finally, we wanted to have connectivity both functionally and for recreational purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| to the future riverwalk, to the existing greenway system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| and now with the Legacy Parks Plan to be able to connect up into the ridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| in the Legacy Parks system that's currently being implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| In terms of project schedule and timing, the current Lowry & Associates contract is on schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=481)|
| 0:08:07| and within the authorized budget amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| My estimate is that the bridge project is considered to be around the 15 to 20 percent completion stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| so there's much work to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| Many factors make the bridge's completion schedule highly variable and very difficult to predict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=501)|
| 0:08:30| It's based on the following factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| Environmental permit processing and advancing into the design development phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| which is the next phase after conceptual design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| is going to be held pending direction from the next mayor and council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| Another factor is the complex property acquisition transactions that are going to be required for air rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=529)|
| 0:08:57| and for some type of rights from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| So we're going to have to work with TDOT for air rights over Neyland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| We need air rights over the Gulf and Ohio Railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| We're going to have to work with TVA for flow-age easement property rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| and then obviously with the University of Tennessee itself, not to mention southside property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=553)|
| 0:09:20| One thing I did want to say on behalf of the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| there are some capital improvements that are going to be required to bring this plan to fruition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| and they are contained in the university's campus master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| The one thing that they have cautioned us and that I have to make sure I repeat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| especially when it comes to the reconstruction of the Andy Holt garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| and the green roof that is contemplated for that garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| they really don't have an established timetable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| and it could be several years before some of these components are actually constructed through UT's capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=593)|
| 0:10:01| The most important aspect I think that makes the budget highly variable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| or the completion schedule for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| is that we have said all along that in order to construct the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=609)|
| 0:10:16| there has to be a redevelopment project on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| So until the economy recovers to some stable level, until market demand improves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=620)|
| 0:10:28| and until private development financing becomes more readily available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| we do not see bridge construction being contemplated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| So it really is a chicken and egg situation in terms of trying to estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=637)|
| 0:10:45| when the bridge could actually be constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| The one thing that is an advantage is if you look at a minimum of three to five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| as an estimate for when the bridge could go to construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| the first thing is the materials here demonstrate a serious commitment on the part of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=658)|
| 0:11:05| to look at the feasibility of having a pedestrian bicycle bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| That's an important signal to potential investors and developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| The second thing is these materials also can be used for marketing the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| that we think is available for redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| We know property owners are interested in moving existing operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=682)|
| 0:11:28| and businesses for a higher and better use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| And then, you know, I think what the conclusion I would make in terms of the schedule is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=692)|
| 0:11:43| we need to pursue continued design work if the bridge is to be pursued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| to develop a more reliable cost estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| We need to also identify environmental impacts that are going to need to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| some of which might be very challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| We also have a time window to develop a funding strategy that is not currently established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=721)|
| 0:12:08| So with that, I wanted to kind of stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| I wanted to just give a context for the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| Again, this is kind of a signal of a handoff to the next administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| and the next sitting city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| but I did want to provide the consultant team an opportunity to present the conceptual design to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=741)|
| 0:12:28| So with that, I will introduce Dick Lowry from Lowry and Associates to carry you through the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| unless there are questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| And while Mr. Lowry comes to the podium, anyone that would like to sign up for public comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=758)|
| 0:12:46| Ms. Wilson has a sign-up sheet over here to my right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| Councilman Delavoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Yes, I was just wondering, and I don't know who would answer this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| but simultaneous with the conceptual work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| have we been exploring other sources of funding other than pure city funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=779)|
| 0:13:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| I think we're prepared to at least talk about options available a little bit later in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| All right, so we haven't addressed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| Mr. Lowry, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| I do want to thank the council for this opportunity to present what we have worked on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=801)|
| 0:13:30| and I want to speak on behalf of that entire team because a lot of our team is Knoxville-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| and has been very helpful to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| We have Carol Johnson and Associates, which is a landscape architecture firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| and Sean Vassington and Sanders Pace Architecture with Brandon Pace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=825)|
| 0:13:53| and we also have Wilbur Smith with Bob Bowers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=833)|
| 0:14:00| and then two people from S&ME who are very important to the project, Liz Porter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=840)|
| 0:14:08| who will do the environmental work, and we'll speak later on the environmental work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| And then we have Mike Stomer, who is going to help with the geotechnical efforts here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=852)|
| 0:14:21| which are very critical to the overall cost of the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| I'm going to talk a little bit about that later, but I think some of that work is critical to the success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=866)|
| 0:14:34| and we have worked on this quite a bit already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| so I want to be able to say a few things about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| I want also to say one thing about our commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=882)|
| 0:14:49| I hope to fashion ourselves as being a little bit different than most consulting engineering firms that do bridge design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=889)|
| 0:14:59| Our goal is to work for excellence in bridge design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=899)|
| 0:15:07| and I think through my training and my background, which goes many, many years back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=907)|
| 0:15:16| I won't tell you how many years, but it is important for us to try to build excellence into the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=916)|
| 0:15:26| and once we know what the structure should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| then to come up with a solution of how to build the structure and make it economical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=930)|
| 0:15:37| and I believe that is very, very possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| I used to work for a man named T.Y. Linn, who was a professor at Cal Berkeley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| He was the originator of prestressed concrete in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| one of the greatest bridge engineers in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| and he often said that every structure should be structurally efficient, aesthetic, and economical at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=956)|
| 0:16:07| and I believe that his approach to that was a whole lot different than what is going on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=967)|
| 0:16:13| When questioned about structure economics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=973)|
| 0:16:21| he said most highway departments, most people that do bridges today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| are those that use sort of a standard approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| They use what they've done before, and they base their price on what they've done before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| and they don't advance forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| and he said that has left us in a country where we have a lot of boring and monotonous presentation of structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1000)|
| 0:16:49| We want to have a presentation that has a degree of excellence and magnificence for the public to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1009)|
| 0:16:57| but also I think we try to do that in a very economical way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| and I think we, in essence, stress both aesthetics and economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| With that little pompous statement, I then would like to talk a little bit about our proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1030)|
| 0:17:22| Bob is going to, we did have a pointer for the screen, but now we're going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| Bob's going to be my pointer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| The two boards, the site plans, there's two boards that are site plans there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1054)|
| 0:17:41| They show a near-term vision and a long-term vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1061)|
| 0:17:50| and I think what we're looking at right now is really the near-term vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| The near-term vision ties into the deck at the arena right at the face of the deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1075)|
| 0:18:05| It does not actually impact the university property in any degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1085)|
| 0:18:15| On the other end, at the south side, we show that the bridge comes across the south bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1095)|
| 0:18:26| and we extend the structure with a comparable structure all the way to Blount Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1106)|
| 0:18:34| When we cross the bank, because of the vertical clearance requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| we're about 50 feet in the air above the terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| In order to get down, we have to go all the way to Blount Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| to get down at a reasonable grade of about 5% or maybe even a little more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| but it's around 5% grade down to Blount Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| That ramp, the original proposals that we made when we interviewed for the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1139)|
| 0:19:07| we looked at something else, which was really, I'd hate to admit it wasn't quite as excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| as what I just said we are committed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| but I think we looked at really a cheap solution, which wasn't that good for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1157)|
| 0:19:25| This one provides a good public solution, and I think will have to be integrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1165)|
| 0:19:32| with any development in that area, and it should be part of that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| We have looked at ways to develop the south waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| with using buildings that are up to five stories high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| that have columns and foundations that we would integrate and use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1186)|
| 0:19:53| both for the building and for the walkway bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1193)|
| 0:20:02| That enabled us at this point to basically make any estimates of cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1202)|
| 0:20:12| for that approach across the south waterfront is really the cost of the superstructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1212)|
| 0:20:21| Most of the substructure and foundation work would be part of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1221)|
| 0:20:28| The other long-term vision basically shows an expansion into University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1228)|
| 0:20:40| Now, I think it's reasonable to say this was our concept of how to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1240)|
| 0:20:48| to aid the university and having a workable solution coming from the tie-in at the deck level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1248)|
| 0:20:58| where the ramp is and the deck level right in front of the arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1258)|
| 0:21:06| I'm sure that when the university gets involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| and there would be certainly variations to that that are quite possible and quite probable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| but it does give you a workable plan to get into the university property in a nice way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1275)|
| 0:21:23| in a workable and fairly excellent solution, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| With that, I don't want to say too much more about the overall project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| I do have Sean Vassington here from Carroll Johnson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| who will talk a little bit more about the connections at both ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| Later, Liz Porter is going to talk about the environmental limits that we sort of set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1301)|
| 0:21:49| and she has some significant things to say about those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| Let me first talk a little bit more about the big bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1314)|
| 0:22:01| The main bridge that we have selected and we recommend for final design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1321)|
| 0:22:10| is a single arch over the entire river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| The spring points on the arch or at the buttresses on both ends are about 710 feet center to center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1336)|
| 0:22:28| The bridge itself is what you would call a dual fixed arch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1348)|
| 0:22:38| It means it's fixed against rotation at the buttresses at each end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| and there's tremendous forces that come into those buttresses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| and they have to be taken down into the foundation into the rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| I've talked at length to Mike about this, and I've looked at some of the preliminary borings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| and we have some ideas about two or three different ways to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| I really think that's one of the key items in cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| If we come up with a cost-effective method, and we have, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| circled into three possibilities that are quite feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1392)|
| 0:23:18| that we can come up with a good solution that would keep the job cost-effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1398)|
| 0:23:25| But that is 710 feet center to center of buttresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1405)|
| 0:23:32| It's about 1,000 feet from the deck to the south waterfront, the bank at the south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1412)|
| 0:23:46| The presentation of the arches are fairly massive at the buttresses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1426)|
| 0:23:54| but as you go out to the mid-span area, the arch gets very slender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1434)|
| 0:24:02| I think this gives quite an elegant presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| and it also gives you a bit of a show of strength and confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| when you look at the bridge and when you're on the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| The bridge is set, the spring points on the bridge are set above elevation 822,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1455)|
| 0:24:23| which I understand to be the TVA boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| And so if we're above that and beyond that, I believe that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| I think our environmental people will verify that that saves a lot of issues in permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1472)|
| 0:24:44| I think one other thing I'd like to point out about the arch is the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1484)|
| 0:24:51| and one of the reasons I really like this is a solution for the challenge that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1491)|
| 0:24:59| The arch is arched vertically to carry vertical loads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1499)|
| 0:25:06| but if you look at it in plan view, it's arched horizontally to take care of transverse loads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1506)|
| 0:25:14| So the bridge as a pedestrian bridge is very stiff in the transverse direction compared to most bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1514)|
| 0:25:21| And for an 800-foot pedestrian bridge where vibration and wind effects are a factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1521)|
| 0:25:31| I'm convinced that that's important for the overall performance of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1531)|
| 0:25:41| I feel that this bridge has a potential of being less shaky, and I don't like to use that word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1541)|
| 0:25:48| but the vibrations on a bridge are not too much of a problem for a highway bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| but when you get on a pedestrian bridge and people get involved, it is quite a factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| So I believe that this offers the opportunity to give much more lateral stiffness with a long span,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1562)|
| 0:26:11| and it should be quite effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| I think the major challenges on the project with the bridge are the geotechnical that I've already mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1577)|
| 0:26:25| There is vibration from a massive, if we have 5,000 people on that bridge at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1585)|
| 0:26:33| what happens to the shaking on the bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| And that's vibration and frequency studies that I think need to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| We are prepared to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| We have already done some very preliminary work on that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| The other thing is wind buffeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| That is a big issue in this type of bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| I think the original proposal was like for a 12- or 14-foot bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| We've widened it out to 25 feet, and I think this has shown us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| we have numbers that say that this is a lot more functional as far as wind performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1626)|
| 0:27:14| I guess with that, I would like to just say one other thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1634)|
| 0:27:22| and then I'll give it over to Sean to talk about the connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| The economy, no doubt, is a big issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1648)|
| 0:27:38| and I think the major thing in economy is construction and the way it's built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1658)|
| 0:27:49| I have worked with a contractor that I know gives me free advice about how to do these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1669)|
| 0:27:57| and I'm quite confident that if we have good construction methods set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1677)|
| 0:28:07| we can do this as economically as any other alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| You must remember that any other alternative must span at least 400 feet, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| to get across the existing channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| And we're up to 700 feet, but I think we also don't have any piers in the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1701)|
| 0:28:28| so we are quite competitive, and I think this offers an excellent solution structurally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1708)|
| 0:28:35| But above all, I think the bridge looks pretty nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| Sean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| Yeah, let me ask counsel here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Is it the wish to wait until the end of the presentation to take questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| or would you like to go ahead and entertain questions as we go along?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| I'm hearing wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| You want to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| If you just make a note of your questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| we'll come back to the appropriate person and direct those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| Go ahead and proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| I'm going to be brief out of respect to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| I think Dick covered a lot of things already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| I will just limit my comments to the connectivity of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| After all, this is a people mover, a bike mover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| and it's important how we land on both sides of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| John, would you give us your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| Oh, I'm sorry, Sean Vasington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| For the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| Sean Vasington, Carroll R. Johnson Associates, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| On the north side, the largest contributing factor was the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| We had conversations with the master planner before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| and immediately after the Board of Trustees adopted the master plan update in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| There was a conceptual design done for the top of Andy Holt Garage that we learned more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1784)|
| 0:29:51| from Bullock Smith and partners here in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| and really just took that concept to the next level, really enhanced their concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1794)|
| 0:30:01| There's also, besides connectivity to the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| there's connectivity to the city greenway system, both in the near term and the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| In the near term, it's really all about getting to the public right away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| at Lake Loudoun Boulevard and Phillip Fulmer Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| and then down to Neyland Greenway at Neyland Drive and Lake Loudoun Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1818)|
| 0:30:25| In the long term, there's connectivity through Gate 10 at the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| over to Second Creek Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| but there's also some cross axes within campus that are identified in the master plan's bike and pedestrian plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1835)|
| 0:30:43| as major axes through campus, so we did our best to make those connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| On the south side, I think it's important to point out that the center line of this bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| really is a direct route to the base of Fort Dickerson and the Urban Wilderness Historic Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| We think there's a tremendous potential there for this bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| and to get people into that corridor and using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| We also took into consideration, as Dave mentioned earlier, the vision plan that was adopted in 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| and in those urban design vignettes, it really set up a language for these buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| both in density, form, and floor-to-area ratios that were taken into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1879)|
| 0:31:27| It also set up a road network in this neighborhood that we needed to apply to folks as they exited the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1887)|
| 0:31:35| I guess with that, I'll conclude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1895)|
| 0:31:42| Thank you, Sean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| I'm Liz Porter with S&ME, and I've been charged with just addressing some of the environmental considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| with the structure, in part because as the design team is moving forward with the design effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| we want to make sure that we're addressing some of the environmental considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| because that also helps build the momentum for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| If you find a private developer that's interested in the south waterfront area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| they're going to want to know that they're not going to be faced with an indefinite period for permitting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| so we're trying to do all of this concurrently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| This project will involve approval from TDOT, Federal Highway Administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, TDEC, TVA, U.S. Fish and Wildlife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| and a host of others that have the potential to comment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| So it's important to get the project in front of some of these agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| and at least let them know what's going on, give them input early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| so that we can identify any of the red flags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| That's what we've been doing as all of this proceeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| and our hope is that as we transfer into the next administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| we've already identified a footprint right now that would potentially be 200 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| on either side of the structure that you see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| that would essentially be our potential construction footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| where you might have lay down areas or access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| So what we would like to do as soon as we can is to submit that footprint to TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| to start going through the environmental clearance document that they will require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| and then as we get a little bit farther in the design of the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| to then go ahead and start getting permits from the other agencies that are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| What we basically wanted to let the commission know is that we recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| that these two design and permitting processes have to kind of work in tandem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| and so S&ME's role is to just make sure that all of that moves forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| in a timely fashion with the bridge design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| And with that, I guess I'll turn it over to Dave for final comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| I think, Vice Mayor Bailey, if there are questions about the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| would you like us to continue forward, or do you want to stop on the design for the time being?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| Okay, what is your next part of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| It was the estimate of probable cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| If you just want to continue at the conclusion, we'll ask our questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| If everybody's able to stay through the hour and a half or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| This is not going to take very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| The first thing I want to tell you is that we did the estimate of probable cost has been portrayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2054)|
| 0:34:22| For the long-range plan, which I think is the larger number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| the current estimate is $17.3 million to $20.5 million as a range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2065)|
| 0:34:33| The actual bridge crossing is somewhere in the up to $11.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2073)|
| 0:34:41| The UT side, the north landing, is up to $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| And then the south landing is on the upper side at $4.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2084)|
| 0:34:52| I know that you'll probably discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| If you have questions about how the cost estimate was generated, then Dick Lawry can answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| In terms of a funding strategy, I'll try to at least give you what I know and then see if you have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2099)|
| 0:35:07| First of all, I do think, as we've been working through this, at least based on some of the rough information we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| we do think that a funding strategy can be devised that makes this project feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| We would not have brought this before you if we didn't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| We currently have a south waterfront federal transportation grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| Most of you know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| You've been approving local matching funds over the past five years for this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| But the actual federal amount is a little under $6 million, and the local match is a little under $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2136)|
| 0:35:45| So the actual number right now that is in our budget is $7,425,000 or, I'm sorry, $7,425,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2145)|
| 0:35:59| I'll say it one more time, $7,425,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| So we know that that money is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| It does not have to be used for the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| It was allocated by Congress for the south waterfront in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| So to make sure that the bridge was eligible, we have received confirmation from federal highways that that money can be used for bridge construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2175)|
| 0:36:23| So that's a known element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| Because there is more work that needs to be done in terms of trying to identify environmental issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| working into the design development phase to get a better sense of reliability for the cost estimates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2194)|
| 0:36:42| the only thing that I've done is tried to look at funding options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| And the things that I can think of, right, in terms of just things to think about is, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2206)|
| 0:36:53| as of this month, we have reserved but unallocated south waterfront funding in the amount of about $8 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2213)|
| 0:37:03| approved in past budgets in the south waterfront capital fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2223)|
| 0:37:10| We could look at, because we do have a window of time before we're going to be ready to go to construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| the future mayoral administration and city councils could consider some incremental addition to the capital reserve for the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2236)|
| 0:37:26| A third one that is really not something that has been really a viable option for other projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2246)|
| 0:37:35| in the south waterfront is kind of using the Chattanooga model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| When there are high-profile public projects, Chattanooga took advantage of private sponsorships and donations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2259)|
| 0:37:47| and they used that successfully to offset some costs that would normally be borne by the public funding agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2267)|
| 0:37:59| I don't know if that will work here or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| but I certainly think we ought to give a serious try to see whether or not that type of philanthropic effort would yield any results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2281)|
| 0:38:10| And then finally, probably the most obvious to me, is we do have an approved redevelopment district for the south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2290)|
| 0:38:17| So that enables us to use tax increment financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| and the general thought is that that would give us a tax increment for both city and county property taxes for a period of 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2303)|
| 0:38:34| So in terms of the target area or the immediate impact area for the south base of the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2314)|
| 0:38:43| I've identified roughly 22 acres of property that are currently in use as industrial or distribution facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2323)|
| 0:38:53| that are not residential or considered to be neighborhood properties or single-family properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| Of that 22 acres, we did develop some vignettes to show plausible development scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2340)|
| 0:39:08| when the south waterfront code was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| Over that 22 acres, under the south waterfront code, if you plop down all the development at once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2352)|
| 0:39:21| that could amount to over a million square feet of gross floor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| And we're talking about typically two to four levels depending on, in terms of height, two to four stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2366)|
| 0:39:37| depending on which district you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| So it is quite possible, even on a conservative side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| to look at somewhere around a million dollars a year being available through a tax increment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2386)|
| 0:39:53| But I hesitate until we can really see whether or not we move further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2393)|
| 0:40:01| We have hesitated to really do a detailed analysis of what that tax increment revenue could really be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2401)|
| 0:40:09| So with that, I'll stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| These are thoughts to pass on to the next administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| And I think that concludes our presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| So if you have questions, I'd be happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| Do we want to continue to follow the agenda here and go to the public comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| and then have our discussion and questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| Ms. Wilson, do we have anybody signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2431)|
| 0:40:39| I'll sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2439)|
| 0:41:10| First speaker and only speaker so far is Susan Malbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2470)|
| 0:41:24| If you'd come to the microphone, please, and give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| And if anyone else would like to address this issue, please come and sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2488)|
| 0:41:39| Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Susan Malbin, M-A-L-B-I-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| And I live actually in Alexandria, Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| And I came down especially for the meeting on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| And tonight's meeting, I do own property here in the South Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2517)|
| 0:42:06| And I just wanted to tell you that I think that this is an excellent, excellent plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2526)|
| 0:42:13| South Knoxville needs some stimulus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| I think that looking forward, we have to put forth options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2538)|
| 0:42:29| And some of the options could be that maybe UT could have a satellite campus in the South Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2549)|
| 0:42:41| And so therefore, I was going to say the children, but the people who attend the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2561)|
| 0:42:50| the students, as well as the professors, could have an option of going across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2570)|
| 0:42:57| And that's not now, but I'd like to just make that comment that maybe then UT could be a little bit more involved financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2577)|
| 0:43:13| The other thing I was thinking of is even though this is supposed to be only a pedestrian bridge or bicycle bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2593)|
| 0:43:23| I would like to see if the building of the bridge could include some sort of future thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2603)|
| 0:43:37| towards having either a monorail or something run on electricity and also solar power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2617)|
| 0:43:47| so that people from the South could go North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| And then I know that under the UT master plan, they are going to have additional areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2632)|
| 0:44:00| where from the end of the bridge on the North side, people could go further into Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2640)|
| 0:44:10| Now on the South side, and my properties are not involved in this in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2650)|
| 0:44:18| except for the fact that I think that some of the poor neighborhoods in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2658)|
| 0:44:25| and the people there are good, upstanding citizens, and they are just not as wealthy as the people on the North side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2665)|
| 0:44:35| And therefore, if we could include, again, in the future, some sort of increase in tourism in the South side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2675)|
| 0:44:49| I think that that would benefit everyone at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| I just thought I would give you my comments and my two cents worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Robert Tanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2703)|
| 0:45:13| You could give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| It's 546 and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| My name is Robert Tanner, T-A-N-N-E-R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| I live at 2646 Scottish Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| I just wanted to make a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| As I said, I own property on Scottish Pike there in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| I'm also an employee at UT, and I'm in support of this pedestrian bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2735)|
| 0:45:42| The houses that have been improved upon on Scottish Pike, many of the renters are UT students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2742)|
| 0:45:50| so I do think that there would be support to use the bridge from the South side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2750)|
| 0:45:58| I also think it would be nice to allow the public to be able to use some of the services at UT that are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2758)|
| 0:46:07| and are difficult to get to sometimes from that part of South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2767)|
| 0:46:13| So I think connecting Knoxville through this pedestrian bridge will be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2773)|
| 0:46:23| And then finally, just some of the greenways, I think it would be another way of connecting some of those services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2783)|
| 0:46:32| and, you know, allow more pedestrian and bicycle traffic in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2792)|
| 0:46:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| That's all the speakers we have signed up, so we'll open it up now for discussion and questions from the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| Councilman Del Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| Yes, thank you, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| I guess for Mr. Lowery, you talked about the design loading that you'd looked at and those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2815)|
| 0:47:06| If you have a university football game with marching bands in lockstep dancing across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2826)|
| 0:47:17| can you take those kinds of loads as well as regular pedestrians?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| That's what the design is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| The dynamic loading issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| We are planning to run a complete analysis on frequency, dynamics, and also a wind tunnel study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2848)|
| 0:47:46| So those kinds of things, I think, need to be done to ascertain for sure that we have the rigidity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2866)|
| 0:47:54| to really limit any vibration to a level that is not, and there are standards, a level that is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2874)|
| 0:48:05| the public would not be sensitive to, and we will definitely design to that standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2885)|
| 0:48:12| Going back, the span from where you get on the bridge to where you get off is 1,000 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| That says 700 feet over the river, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| It's 1,000 feet from the deck where it ties into the deck at the arena to the south bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2903)|
| 0:48:35| To the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| How about to where you get off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| The bank at Blount Avenue is about another 500, I forget, it's over 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| So you've got 1,500 feet you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| Yes, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| And is there a possibility of getting access instead of at UT or at the south end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2929)|
| 0:48:57| but somewhere along the Nalin Drive if you're walking or jogging or want to get off somewhere close to City View Apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2937)|
| 0:49:06| or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| Or must you travel the whole thing and then double back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| How do you get access if you're a pedestrian that doesn't want to go the full?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2950)|
| 0:49:15| We've talked about that in length, and Sean, I think, has got an answer because we have really discussed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2955)|
| 0:49:22| Yeah, thanks, Dick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| I'll do my best anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| We didn't depart too far from the location of the bridge given that it was adopted in 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| but we did look at seven different locations in the Thompson Bowling Arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| including two options that didn't touch the arena at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| Given the spatial constraints that you see above ground and below ground on Nalin Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| it was really impossible for us to land right on Nalin Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| There's also some topographical issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| Unfortunately, that's a crest in Nalin Drive right where it hits Lake Loudoun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| So if you could imagine, we're working against, we're chasing grade coming off the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| because the road is also going down in elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| So it presented a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| In fact, in our interview, we had an option that had an elevator right on Nalin Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3009)|
| 0:50:15| obviously not conducive to bicycle movement, but it would at least get pedestrians up from the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| And as we explored it further, those spatial constraints came into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| So really they're not available given the bank and the road that's there and everything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| I have one question about the arch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| Is it more of a safety or aesthetics or just a combination about the arch of the bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3039)|
| 0:50:49| Why the arch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| Yeah, I'm asking is it more of a safety factor or is it an aesthetics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3050)|
| 0:50:57| or is it pretty much a combination of both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| I think we like the arch because it offers what I call structural efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3060)|
| 0:51:08| And it is a, when you look at it structurally for that kind of span,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3068)|
| 0:51:16| you can see a smooth flow of the loads applied to the arch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| which are basically a lot of it is the dead load, the arch itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| is carried very efficiently with a straight line on the arch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| So it takes less material to use an arch than it does to use a girder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3092)|
| 0:51:39| If you just use a straight girder with a deck on top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| I think there's a lot more loss, a lot more material used that is not cost effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3102)|
| 0:51:52| I think we save money, but we also, I think the appearance of the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3112)|
| 0:51:59| I think you can see when you look at the structure a certain amount of efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| that is, I think, an aesthetic plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| And I think one of the big issues is efficiency leads to aesthetics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| and it should lead to economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| Councilman Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| First of all, I want to commend the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| To me, it's a beautiful, beautiful structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| and it's really going to be an asset to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| The arch going over the river, I think, is very commendable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| But, Dave, I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| When you were talking about the monies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| that you were saying there's $7,425,500 available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| and then when you went on with the presentation you talked about another $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| Was that $7 million part of that $8 million, or is there $15 million available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| Sir, there's $15 million available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| We have the grant money, but we also have about $8 million in city funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3173)|
| 0:53:00| that is part of the capital program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| And that's already been allocated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| No, it has not been allocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| $8 million has not been allocated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| First district, Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| Yeah, I think that, you know, since it is my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| and I probably ought to weigh in on this a little bit, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| I'll say that I'm obviously very optimistic, cautiously optimistic about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| I mean, a lot of it is going to hinge on, you know, the new council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| and the administration that's going to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| But, you know, I think that we need to, as this moves forward, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| I took time to read about 300 trailers in the new Sentinel about the article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| Some people think it's nuts and some people think it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| And it's going to be, you know, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| any time you spend that kind of money it's going to be controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| But let me say this, you know, and I see Jim York out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| and I know Jim probably has this right off the top of his head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| but I would be curious to know the amount of tax revenue that was brought in, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| in the CBID district 15 years ago before we spent all the money, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3244)|
| 0:54:10| for the infrastructure and what we've done on the current waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| excluding the south waterfront, what we've done downtown, the old city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| and see what the revenues are now as opposed to when they were before that development took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3259)|
| 0:54:28| And I think that that is a very logical way for us to go about this as an economic development tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3268)|
| 0:54:36| because it certainly is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| It lends itself, obviously, greatly to the, you know, south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3277)|
| 0:54:45| You know, the potential there is just, you know, it just ties right into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| And it also ties into the urban wilderness thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| And Ms. Malvin was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| I think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| Thank you very much for coming all that distance just to be with us this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| and let us know your thoughts and whether it affects your property or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| I mean, regardless of that, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| But it does, the urban wilderness, I would urge you to go on the Legacy Parks website, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| and learn about what's happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| So this is, you know, you see the theme here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| It's really starting to tie in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| And I'd also like to thank Commissioner Brown, it's his district as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| for being here and taking notes and being involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| But, you know, I just think that it's really something we keep talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3328)|
| 0:55:34| You know, we've done a lot of great work downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| Now it needs to start going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| And here you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| Here it's going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| And it's just going to connect, you know, downtown, UT campus to South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| We talk about, the gentleman was talking about that the young people are already going there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| The property values will skyrocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| You know, UT potentially could invest over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| Who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| But I'll guarantee you this, there will be investment, you know, if this thing does forge ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| So I know if other council members are going, well, you know what, Pavlos, you know, I've got, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| I'd like to have this money in my district as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| So I'm cognizant of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| But, you know, let's just look at it conceptually as to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| And, Jim, I'd like to, you know, if it wouldn't be too much trouble to get that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| tax information available to us to let.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| Oh, he knows it off the top of his head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| Surprise, surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| Jim York, city finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| The increment for FY1011 in the CBID or TDZ was roughly $3.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3394)|
| 0:56:47| As opposed to, well, but, you know, if you go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| Again, I don't have the base numbers off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| I can tell you what the increment was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| And the increment was for last year was roughly $3.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| So, you know, anyway, I could go on and on about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| But, again, it ties in so nicely with our, you know, with our Civil War forts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| the urban wilderness, the vestal area being redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| And we'll move forward cautiously and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| see who the next administration and council members are because, as we all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| without five black votes, you can't get a whole lot done up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| So I'm just excited about it, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| I think the design is beautiful, and I'm excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| And I keep thinking we could just look forward a few more years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| and we're walking across the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| But I don't think that's going to happen next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| I do think that this offers great opportunities for South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| not only the waterfront, but the urban wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| and the development of that entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| It also helps us tie to some development farther into the Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| It's going to Sevierville Pigeon Forge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| and I think it could give us the opportunity to capitalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| and generate some revenue from tourists who come to those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| We are in a garden spot, apparently, for tourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| and we certainly appreciate what tourists bring to us in the way of visits and revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3493)|
| 0:58:19| So, like probably other council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| I would really like to think we could get this going immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| but also pragmatically and being a physical conservative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| and waiting for the money to fall out of the sky or that tree to be lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| But, Councilman Pavlis, I echo your support and interest in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3515)|
| 0:58:41| and I'm just waiting for the money to fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| Just briefly, one thing I like about the design that hasn't already been talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| is it doesn't depend on pylons in the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| It's a nice, clean design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| You don't have to embed anything in the river bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| and it takes away any issues about barge traffic and anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| So, if you get that same kind of strength without using pylons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| I think that's a really good way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| And just to echo Councilman Pavlis as far as the benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| and also this is not exactly a new idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| This is something that's been talked about a long time by people in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| that are very comfortable with the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| I think there's a consensus among people who have worked in Knoxville on pedestrian traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| and have looked at the south waterfront development for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| that at some point we really, really needed to go forward with a bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| somewhere along the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| It's just now being fleshed out, I think, where is the best place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| And it will truly be an asset not only to south Knoxville but to the whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| And, you know, looking at our counterpart, this is stating the obvious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| but you look at what the pedestrian bridge did in Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| and the growth that came across the bridge there and the amount of use that they're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| So I like the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| Dave, when you looked at the location of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| I know for the longest time we were talking about that proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| What other areas did you consider and why did you decide on this in the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| Because, you know, if you go a little bit east of Thompson Bowling and Neyland Stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| you're really over there near the Norfolk Southern Bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| which that accessed over to World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| And, you know, one of the things that originally when we were talking about the south waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| a lot of us were thinking about economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| and utilizing the south waterfront as a great asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| And so, you know, the justification to move forward that there was a real business case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| to invest in the south waterfront and in the pedestrian bridge was a connectivity thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| And as Councilman Pablis brings up, the urban wilderness is really intriguing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3651)|
| 1:00:57| And all the parks and the bike trails and to think that if you went to the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3657)|
| 1:01:03| and you could cross a bridge on a bike over and hit all these different trails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| and really that's a fabulous experience for, you know, bike riders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| But when you look at the diagrams here, it runs right in there to Thompson Bowling Arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3672)|
| 1:01:18| And as I think about that, that's a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| And so in terms of connectivity and access, how did we arrive, when did we arrive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| and how did we arrive on that location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| Well, first of all, we looked early on in the planning process at different options just to connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3690)|
| 1:01:39| And in some respects, I think when we received public comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3699)|
| 1:01:46| there was desire to talk about economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| but I think a lot of the residents really were just looking for another viable route to get across the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3709)|
| 1:01:58| And I think part of that was because Henley Street was really not a safe place to cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| I mean, we're lucky, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| and we're going to have improved pedestrian and bicycle facilities on Henley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| but back at that time it was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| you're taking your life in your own hands walking across Henley Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| So we looked at, and two of the most viable alternatives that we were looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| were connecting into Second Creek Greenway and going up to World's Fair Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| or going into the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| And a couple of things I think that eventually played out were, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3746)|
| 1:02:33| we really liked the idea of saving money and trying what I call generically a strap-on bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3753)|
| 1:02:41| or an attached bridge to the Norfolk Southern Railroad Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| And the more we got looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| the first thing we knew is it's very difficult trying to have a joint use on a railroad facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3767)|
| 1:02:54| So that was an uphill battle to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| The other problem is, and we were looking at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| one of the most notable cities in the country that does these attached bridges is Portland, Oregon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3779)|
| 1:03:06| And so we were looking at what they were doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| and in almost every instance they have grade separation between the main railroad tracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| and the level that the pedestrians and the bicyclists are using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| There are cutouts in that Norfolk Southern Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| that are required in order to get vertical clearance over the barge channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| And so it's a very, very difficult design challenge to try to figure out how to get that grade separation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3805)|
| 1:03:33| you know, in terms of the elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| If you go down below the railroad tracks, you're going to block the barge traffic or the barge clearance zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3816)|
| 1:03:43| and it's very difficult to go up above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| So that was one of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| Another thing was the more we talked about it, the more we said this has to be economically realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3827)|
| 1:03:54| And in terms of the energy or the activity at the World's Fair Park and Second Creek Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3834)|
| 1:04:02| it really did not compare favorably to the tie to the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| So we really started to hone in on the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| That was part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| It's shown on the vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| And you're really constrained when you're looking at connection points to the university| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| because you've got the stadium, you've got significant parking structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| As you head further to the west, you have a KUB sewage treatment plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3863)|
| 1:04:32| So there just aren't a lot of viable alternatives to be able to connect to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| The one thing that I think broke it for us was the campus master plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| because if you go and if you look at the campus master plan, the connection up through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| and someday the enhanced roof of the Andy Holt Garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| that actually intersects with the East-West Grand Mall that's in their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3894)|
| 1:05:00| So you have a very good axis of connection into what I think UT in the future wants to promote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3900)|
| 1:05:08| is almost exclusively pedestrian and bicycle traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| So that's really what led to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| The bottom line is if the bridge couldn't pay for itself, we didn't think it was wise to recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3914)|
| 1:05:23| And I think that's proving even more prudent now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| When I talked about options, you notice I didn't mention state or federal grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| I don't think this is a time in our economy where we are looking for grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| I mean, we'll continue to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3937)|
| 1:05:38| And if they're available, we'd love to take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| But I don't think we can assume we're going to get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| Councilman Dale Bope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| It almost seems like we have the city taxpayers financing a bridge that will help UT get its students across to housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3949)|
| 1:06:00| or something else in South Knoxville, maybe business activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| I'm just wondering if, because of its location, it isn't geared mostly to serve the campus rather than the general populace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3963)|
| 1:06:12| Now, I heard Mr. Pavlis talk about, you know, it might do some good for South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| It might do some good for the waterfront and the city benefits from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| But it really looks like a bridge for students rather than a bridge for residents of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3980)|
| 1:06:27| And I'd like you to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| And I also wanted to mention, and you can throw that in there, is how close is the new Hanley Street Bridge with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| the bike lanes and the sidewalks and everything we're going to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| How close is that to the location of this bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| And I guess the third piece would be, what about condemning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| or taking the railroad bridge for a pedestrian bridge rather than building a separate bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| But talk about the whole concept of who gets served by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| and what's nearby that might serve the same purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| Well, Councilman Della Volpe, we have been hearing, and there are some people that think that not only is it serving UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4015)|
| 1:07:02| but UT is almost commandeering our locational decision-making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| Nothing could be further from the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| I think that the university sees this as complementary to the campus, and they see some opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4030)|
| 1:07:18| but they really have a lot of challenges right on the campus that they have to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4038)|
| 1:07:24| They're trying to become a top 25 school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| and they've got a lot of different objectives in their capital planning that really make the bridge secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4046)|
| 1:07:35| So if I were to – I guess the way I view this is that if you have 22 acres of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4055)|
| 1:07:43| and I've done the calculations, they actually yield in combined city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| and county property taxes about $67,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| So if you have 22 acres and you can use some of that economic energy from UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4072)|
| 1:08:01| and see it bleed over onto the south side and you can get those 22 acres redeveloped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| I guess I would argue that we're getting the benefit of some support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4086)|
| 1:08:14| and complementary uses that may benefit the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| but ultimately we're getting a major piece of the south side, south Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| redeveloped into a higher and better use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| So the property tax, not just in terms of paying for the cost of the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4106)|
| 1:08:32| but adding that to the tax base for years and years to come, I think is almost – it sounds negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4112)|
| 1:08:40| but it's almost looking at the university as we're being parasitic and wanting to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4120)|
| 1:08:46| Lead some of their energy onto an area that really hasn't had that much market demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4126)|
| 1:08:52| How about the proximity to the railroad bridge or the Henley Street Bridge as the option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| Well, the Norfolk Southern Bridge is very close to the Henley Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| That's another reason, I think, that we weren't terribly impressed with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| I don't know the linear spacing, but in terms of relative spacing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4145)|
| 1:09:11| I do know that the Henley and Gay Street Bridges are more closely spaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| than between Henley and the proposed pedestrian bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| And quite honestly, I believe that the proposed pedestrian bridge is actually closer to the CSX Railroad Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4160)|
| 1:09:27| than it is to the Norfolk Southern Bridge, and if I need to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4167)|
| 1:09:33| So anyways, in terms of spacing, we knew we had givens in terms of Gay Street and Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4173)|
| 1:09:42| The spacing certainly is much better if you're looking at three miles of shoreline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| It's much better to move it down to its current proposed location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| than somewhere near the Norfolk Southern Railroad Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4192)|
| 1:09:57| There was one final question you had, and I'm trying to remember what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| I just asked what about possibly using the railroad bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| Doesn't it just serve one asphalt plant or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| Oh, you asked about condemning the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| Mr. Swanson can do that for you in probably six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| Closer to 60 years, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| That's an active line that runs council house once a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| And it also serves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| Yeah, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| Gulf and Ohio also has rights to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| Councilman Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| Dave, I'm going to ask you a question that's been asked me several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| and it's really the chicken and the egg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| You've got, from what you're saying, is we have approximately $15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| So do we take the $15 million and begin the development on the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| and then do the bridge later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| or do we spend the $15 million and build a bridge now and hope that development will come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| So if you can help me answer that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| because that is a question that a number of people have asked me in terms of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4256)|
| 1:11:02| Well, for anybody who wants to know my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4262)|
| 1:11:09| I would say that I would not want to use that $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| I would not recommend using that $8 million in unreserved south waterfront capital funding for the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4272)|
| 1:11:20| Instead, I would try to proceed cautiously and strategically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4280)|
| 1:11:27| The first piece of advice I would give would be we have about almost $300,000 in that federal design grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4287)|
| 1:11:35| that we could still use for continuing design work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| And so right now, if we use that entire design grant, there's 20 percent local match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| We'll have about $140,000 spent if we get more into the environmental process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4305)|
| 1:11:52| as well as a little bit more detail in the design development phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| So that would be the next milestone I would say to go to with minimal risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4316)|
| 1:12:03| and then stop and just another let's see where we stand, let's see how much costs have changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4323)|
| 1:12:10| let's see how menacing the environmental mitigation is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4330)|
| 1:12:18| and then take a deep breath and go further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| But the bottom line that I would continue to recommend is if you can't get the tax increment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4342)|
| 1:12:30| and the development project on the south side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4350)|
| 1:12:35| you ought not be considering trying to build that bridge and having nothing built on the south side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4355)|
| 1:12:43| no commitment to private investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| That's been kind of the policy all the way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| The economy has also halted the project over by South Knoxville Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| I think we hold still and just wait for the economy to recover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| So what you're saying is then the money that's already been allocated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| you would still recommend that that be set aside for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| And so what you're looking for is not only the $8 million federal grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4386)|
| 1:13:11| but also monies from some other sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| Well, the $7.4 million that we have in that federal grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4393)|
| 1:13:22| I have been in contact with Congressman Duncan's office concerned about whether there's an expiration date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4402)|
| 1:13:28| or a possibility of rescission of the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| Because it's a high-priority project grant, it is not currently threatened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| It doesn't mean that won't happen in the future, but right now there is no deadline for use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4414)|
| 1:13:42| That being said, again, that $8 million in unreserved, you could use for other public improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4422)|
| 1:13:52| You don't know what's going to happen to the former Baptist Hospital site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| You don't know if South Shore Properties might be able to get some kind of project going over by South Knox Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4436)|
| 1:14:05| So I would hold that in abeyance and, at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4445)|

| 1:14:15| You still have some time, and you don't have to be forced into a position to commit funding, so why do it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4455)|
| 1:14:24| Let's, you know, see what the future holds and make a better informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| But go to the next step so that we have better information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| Well, as long as you're getting a 20 percent investment or you're investing 20 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4472)|
| 1:14:42| and the federal government's investing 80 percent, at least you're spending money that is of minimum risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4482)|
| 1:14:50| and it has to be used for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| You can't use it someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| If there's no objection, I'd like to recognize Commissioner Brown here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| He had a comment for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| Thank you, Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| I intended to be a spectator tonight, but there's some things that have happened in the last few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| that I think will provide some answers for some of the questions that have been asked by some of the council folks up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4509)|
| 1:15:19| In the last four months, we have added, we've heard the urban wilderness thing two or three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4519)|
| 1:15:27| We've added over 300 acres, was it, Nick, in the TWRA property over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| another couple hundred acres of public and private land in the urban wilderness area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4533)|
| 1:15:39| Nick and I have been working with some private homeowners who are avid bikers and all of this kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4539)|
| 1:15:50| They have friends who want to move close to this new gym that we have over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4550)|
| 1:15:56| Folks, we haven't scratched the tip of the iceberg on the urban wilderness thing yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4556)|
| 1:16:02| This is something that I don't want to say the yuppie generation, but they're a lot younger than me today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4562)|
| 1:16:10| that are into this kind of stuff, and they're going to be biking and hiking all over this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| If they come here to do that, I mean, it's not just Knoxville folks going to be coming to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| It's going to be folks coming from all over the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| They come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| They're going to have to have motels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| They're going to have a place to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| They're going to buy gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| Everybody's going to benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| We have an opportunity that's in my lifetime I've not seen in this town, in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4589)|
| 1:16:38| So this would be an absolute jewel to have that tied right in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4598)|
| 1:16:44| We now have control of all the four forts, which is going to be worked into a tour situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4604)|
| 1:16:54| So the Civil War folks, if you don't believe they're rabid, you should have been out to Claps Farm last weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4614)|
| 1:17:00| and watched the reenactment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| You know, hundreds of people come out there every year to watch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| And some of them come year after year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| And hundreds and hundreds of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| There was about 500 scouts out there for that weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| So there's hundreds of people interested in this type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| We have it right here, right across the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| Let's take advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| Okay, I'd just like to ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| I hope you'll talk to Mayor Burchett and get a few million and pass them over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4643)|
| 1:17:29| Still trying to get a representative from Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| Mr. Hill, thank you very much for a great presentation, and we appreciate everyone involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| Thank you, Vice Mayor and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| Okay, we're going to move on now to the Ridgetop Protection Plan next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| And I would just go back the ways we agreed to jointly move forward with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4666)|
| 1:17:54| to see if we could come up with one plan for the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| And we've had city councils now had ten different meetings on the Ridgetop slope issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4678)|
| 1:18:07| And what I wanted to do is to have a discussion publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4687)|
| 1:18:12| and then ultimately take a vote, have a poll on whether the council would like to have one more meeting with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4692)|
| 1:18:22| to see if we can, one, agree on one plan, and then we would then go our separate ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4702)|
| 1:18:30| and follow our respective charters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| And I guess the key point in all of this is that on October the 17th, Monday, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4714)|
| 1:18:44| the MPC will deliver their recommendations and analysis on the incorporation of Option B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4724)|
| 1:18:54| the Councilman Della Vopi amendments, and the original plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4734)|
| 1:19:00| So what we would do is we would take what the MPC has given us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| and we would then convene in a pretty short time with the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4744)|
| 1:19:10| and we'd work out that schedule with Chairman Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| and have some kind of a process jointly, quickly, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4753)|
| 1:19:19| and then have a poll to see if we could move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| So I'd like to open it up for discussion and see if there's any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| Yeah, as much as we may feel a little meeting out, we've gone this long road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4769)|
| 1:19:35| and I think MPC is going to bring something to the table that we'd want to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| And I suspect that it's prudent on our part to invest in one more session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| and air the issues that that brings out and get on with the show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4784)|
| 1:19:51| I'll put you down in the affirmative category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| It was my understanding that when MPC took the Della Vopi plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| the Norman plan, the chamber plan, the existing plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| that they were going to go back and come together with some ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| that they were going to present to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| And I personally would like to see what that is in order to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| but really my real hope is that both we as the city and the county can come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4814)|
| 1:20:20| with an agreement that we have the same plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| And so I think it's imperative that we find out what happens with MPC on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| in terms of what they present, and then hopefully they'll send us the information at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4830)|
| 1:20:35| Of course, we have a council meeting Tuesday night, but that we get that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| and then we can set up at least another meeting with the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4839)|
| 1:20:44| and hopefully wrap this up, but wrap it up together on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| That would be my affirmative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| I'll put you down as a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| Any other discussion, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| Let's just have a quick show of hands, and all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| Any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4867)|
| 1:21:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111013?start=4882)|
