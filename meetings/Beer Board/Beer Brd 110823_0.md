| 0:08:32| My bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| I figured the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Once the name came up, people would be like, whoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| But it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| Councilwoman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| I have a question for the Lieutenant from the Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| Our records check indicate that the same applicant is on the permit for Copacabana,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| but it's not in compliance, and I'm not familiar with the cited code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| Could you explain that to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| That's the annual alcohol training that they're required to attend, and the owner is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| the only one on the beer permit for Copacabana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| They tried adding another person as a manager and sent that person to the task class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| but they were ineligible to be on the beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| and they were also sent a letter advising them of that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| But they're not in compliance either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| I'm not comfortable approving this permit tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| I'd like to hear from my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| Sir, it's very important to this beer board that our applicants understand the laws about serving alcohol in this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=568)|
| 0:09:36| particularly in the prevention of service to underage persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| and you are not in compliance with the education requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| He didn't take the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| I'll let him know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| I took the class last year for Larumba, I believe, but I'll let him know he needs to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| And excuse me, sir, I wasn't quite finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| And in addition, you've not completed the task class requirement for the application for this permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| So I'm not comfortable approving this permit this evening where things stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=598)|
| 0:10:06| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| I support Councilwoman Roddy's concerns on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| Attending the task class and training your employees is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| You have indicated this is a nightclub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| You'll have a younger clientele probably with an opportunity for underage drinkers to be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| So I would certainly encourage us to postpone this until the paperwork can get in order and the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=628)|
| 0:10:36| Are you applying for a liquor license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| When do you think that that will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| I spoke to the area of the liquor in Virginia, and it should be about two weeks until they finish the liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=644)|
| 0:10:52| So, I mean, you've got sight problems, sightlessness problems from the Wallace Chapel Christian Science Reading Room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=652)|
| 0:11:04| I mean, there's a lot of problems with this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| You know, I just don't know that we can move forward tonight, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| Yeah, I just was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| I see that Wallace Chapel and the Christian Science Reading Room being within the 300-foot limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=676)|
| 0:11:23| How did that work with Fairbanks, the entity that was there apparently before it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| They didn't have a beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| Oh, they did not have the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| They had liquor, but not a beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| That answers that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| We would need a motion to postpone or no motion, or I won't recognize Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=701)|
| 0:11:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| I'd like to make a motion that we postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Until?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| What's 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| Tell me about they're applying for a liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| Well, all this goes, the sightlessness requirements goes away if he receives a liquor permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=720)|
| 0:12:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| So if he's thinking that's two weeks, then I think an appropriate motion would be until the next meeting, September 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| Will that be enough time for the task force training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| Excuse me, Mr. Delaboe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| I didn't know you were done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| I was going to ask that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| Is that enough time to take the class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| Yes, we offer a task class every Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| And my motion is to postpone until the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| Which would be September 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| There's a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| There's a further discussion on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Hearing none, all those in favor of the postponement until September 20th, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=765)|

| 0:12:48| You understand what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| Yeah, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Yeah, I'm just helping him open the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| The owner actually needs to take the class, and I told him he needed to take the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| I just want to make sure you're clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| I'm sorry about the mispronunciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=781)|

| 0:13:35| And could you tell us a little bit about the festival?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| The Ola Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| Let me recognize Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| Is that Ola?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| I wondered, should we vote now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Yes, could you tell us a little bit about the festival?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| I think I've been to one or two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| The Ola Festival this year will take place on September the 24th, and we have moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| one block down to Depot Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| Ola's office, as I said, is at the Emporium Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| We're trying our very best to bring people to Knoxville, to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| Last year's festival attracted about 9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| We had about 20,000 people altogether, and 9% from out of the state, not out of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=853)|
| 0:14:20| and not out of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| They were from out of state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| So this year we have been working also with the Tennessee Department of Tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| We have several media partners in Nashville, and we're hoping to at least have 10,000 more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=869)|
| 0:14:36| coming to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| And this is part of Hispanic Heritage Month, which goes from September 15th through October 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=878)|
| 0:14:46| The Ola Festival falls somewhere in between whenever the football schedule allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| And it's a big celebration of Hispanic cultures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| I wanted to highlight that most of the festival participants are local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| They're people who live in Knoxville and have lived here for many, many years, some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| They're from different backgrounds, from Mexico, Spain, Guatemala, Nicaragua, from different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=906)|
| 0:15:14| And we all come together once a year and showcase our culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=914)|
| 0:15:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| It's an outstanding event if you've never attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| So we do have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| And unless there's further discussion, we'll take it to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=939)|

| 0:15:53| Okay, they're going to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| I've got a letter here somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| Until, did it say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| It had to be the September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Okay, September 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| All right, well, I'll make a motion to defer it until September 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| I've just really got a question how they're going to pull that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=973)|
| 0:16:21| Anyway, I'll make a motion that we defer it until September 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=985)|

| 0:16:29| All those in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=989)|

| 0:17:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1063)|

| 0:17:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| See Ms. Day, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1071)|
| 0:17:58| Smokey's Sports Pub has asked for another delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1078)|
| 0:18:06| I do believe to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| We started this process with them, I believe, in December of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| They're asking for a deferral until November the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| We want to assume that that is, we'll say, the second with a normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| bear board hearing in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| Not knowing the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| Yes, if you'll recall, this proprietor had lost their lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| In fact, we just approved the Mountain City Salmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| Andy's in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| They had found a second location to relocate their business and then it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| turned out there were fire code problems with not having sprinklers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| So they've had to go on the search again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| I think it's appropriate to postpone once more to give them that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| I'll move to November 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| It is the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| So that would be a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| Do I hear a second on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| Further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| Not all those in favor of moving this or deferring until November the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| Say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1163)|

| 0:19:57| Not that anybody doesn't know, but let's talk about it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| This year it's on September the 23rd, 24th, and 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| We hope for good weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| We have a lot of people come to our festival, just like they went to the Ola Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1207)|
| 0:20:14| And obviously we have a lot of food, drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| What's different this year, we have Greek beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| It's the first time we were able to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| So we look forward to good weather and have a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| It's always a great event, well attended, and I hope for your good weather, that's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1227)|
| 0:20:34| So I'll make the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Any discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| We'll come to the addendum here on the beer board agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1252)|
| 0:21:00| And I would defer to you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| First up is Peter Kern Bar, 407 Union Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| As you see, we granted them, subject to final documentation, May 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| They have requested construction issues, a 60-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1272)|
| 0:21:21| And I will make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| Any discussion on the motion to defer for 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| If not, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| Three Rivers Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| We've got a little bit of an unusual, I won't say unusual, but it is an unusual situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1297)|
| 0:21:46| We approved them subject to final documentation for an on and off premise in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| Due to circumstances beyond their control, such as their handmade benches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| and the places where they could sit and enjoy an adult beverage on site has not come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1318)|
| 0:22:06| The market is due to open this weekend, if I understand right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| And they have asked to have this switched to an off premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1332)|
| 0:22:20| so they could go ahead and start, you know, selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1340)|
| 0:22:28| So, I mean, Mr. Swanson, if I'm not mistaken, or I guess we could do this administratively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| we could just amend the original document since they met all the requirements for an on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1354)|
| 0:22:43| I just need a motion from a member of the beer board to amend the application for an off premise permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| rather than an on and off premise permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| And I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| It needs a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| When they finally finish their structure and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| will they have to reapply for the on premise permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| Is that how that works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| I believe that they would have to reapply for the on premise as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| even though they've met the requirements, you know, prior to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| We're converting this one to an off premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| To an off premise, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| Is everybody clear on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| I mean, it is a little bit unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| I want to make sure we're moving forward with clarity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| Seeing no signs, I want to assume that we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| So the motion was and seconded that we amend this to an off premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| So all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| That's the amendment, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| That's for the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| My bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| We approved the amended application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| and now we'll have to vote on that application again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| So maybe the chairman needs to be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| I mean, straightened out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| But anyway, so we're going to vote on the amended, the application as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| So all those in favor of that, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| We got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| If you'll see Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1457)|
| 0:24:24| We have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| I have a question if we can go back for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| I'd like some clarification on the Lambda Chi Alpha permit that they're asking for this benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1471)|
| 0:24:40| How does this tie in with, you know, the fraternity is part of the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| and I would just like some clarification in terms of if anyone knows, is the university doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1485)|
| 0:24:52| or how do we check this out from the standpoint of fraternity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| I think the fraternity is a legal entity separate and apart from the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| I don't think the university would agree that the fraternity is a legal part of that entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| They have a legal existence of their own aside from the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| Now, the question is, can they do what they want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| If they're seeking to do it on university property, you know, that's a matter for them to clear with the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1512)|
| 0:25:21| Were they doing it in the World's Fair Park or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| I can't remember now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| Has this ever come up before to the beer board in terms of fraternity wanting to sponsor a beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Big Dogs on the Porch or something like that used to come on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1532)|
| 0:25:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Ms. Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| I talked with or had communications with Timmon Rogers, who's the vice chancellor for student affairs, in regard to this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1543)|
| 0:25:51| and the university was unaware of this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| The National Lambda Chi Chapter was unaware of this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| This is not something that the university sanctions, and it is not something that the National Chapter sanctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1561)|
| 0:26:08| One of the communications said that this young man was well-intentioned because this was a fundraiser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| but apparently didn't know all of the ramifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| The applicant is Lambda Chi Alpha on the applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| Another communication was that the Bearden Beer Garden would be applying for the license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| and would serve as the vendor to operate this event at World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1590)|
| 0:26:37| Where we now are is where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| We've had no Bearden Beer Garden, and this young man is not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| and Mr. Rogers will be here later tonight on another matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| You know, it's going to be suspect as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| I mean, I've got four days to meet all the requirements, so, I mean, we'll just deal with it at the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| You know, we have a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| I'll say that at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| Any further discussion on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| If not, we'll move to the administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| First up, which is a continuation from last month's meeting, is Raceway Number 6757, Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1628)|
| 0:27:21| Give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| Tariq Hamdan, 4418 Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| Sergeant, do you have all the charges there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1652)|
| 0:27:41| They just got two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| Yeah, it was just two sales to minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| That's what the problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| Two sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| You know, last month, you unfortunately had to be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| Yeah, I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| And you sent a very qualified person, but we felt like the board felt like it was probably more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1675)|
| 0:28:02| to have the person who actually owns the business come in and either yourself or your representative here to explain to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1682)|
| 0:28:11| you know, the plan that you have to prevent this from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| It's happened twice, and so it's very concerning to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| I have this business for the last six years, and obviously for the last one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| I was just kind of having another business in Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| and the manager in there was not taking the really good steps with the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| which is we've been through a lot of young people coming to that area, and we're trying to make it as secure as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1713)|
| 0:28:45| And every time we sit with the employee, we're trying to give them some of the high education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| which they give it in KPD, the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| We're trying to give them high-pointed things about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| And we have a private shopper, like so far he's not breaking the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| We tried so many times to send him, but he did not success, either the system or the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1744)|
| 0:29:11| And that will give me a good point for all the employees, that they've been improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| And the beer classes, of course, we're going to make it yearly for one of each of the employees to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| And I have here like four or five fake IDs already being submitted to KPD, like we just got them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1761)|
| 0:29:29| and I don't know what, we just give it to them, and they will toast them and do whatever with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1769)|
| 0:29:36| And I think we are doing as much as we can just to keep it going, because we've been six years in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1776)|
| 0:29:43| and just for the last two years, the manager seems it wasn't really strict with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| But hopefully, if you can put the business under probation, and we can improve the best we can for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1788)|
| 0:29:56| I guess, really, unless I'm missing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| Vice Mayor Bailey, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| I was just going to ask him to be specific in what types of changes or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| what measures are you going to take to prevent this from ever happening again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| Well, the steps that I've been just talking about, to check the employees regularly by sending somebody every now and then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| that will definitely take care of all the part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| Like I'll keep an eye on the top of each and every one of them on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1823)|
| 0:30:30| Kind of walk us through what will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| Do you have some type of technology that you punch in their birth date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| Oh, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| That's in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| They cannot bypass that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| Like any working customer with a beer, he will be approaching the cashier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| He needs to hand his ID, and they have to punch the month and day and year, and it will not pass if it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1845)|
| 0:30:52| It will completely take it off the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| Before it was just attempt, like deleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| Now it will not take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| It will just go to cancel the transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| That's update we already made like two months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| So you've done that after the last information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| Well, that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| Well, all the other points in there which we are talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| Just walk us through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| We have the calendar next to the cashier, which they can look, so they will not forget the date of birth before that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1879)|
| 0:31:26| And the beer glasses, of course, we give them all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| And we have the meeting where we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| Number one subject was the beer other than the cashier, the count, closing, and all this stuff, and closing the main door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1891)|
| 0:31:40| After two to three, that's very important when people usually been drinking enough, and it's not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| So we closed the door at that time, so we avoid the cashier to be in such a bad situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1905)|
| 0:31:52| And we have the sticker on all the coolers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| We added the sticker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| So even if somebody coming to buy the beer and he will see all the sticker in there, they know that we ID each and everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1916)|
| 0:32:05| And, yeah, and they check if somebody is intoxicated in the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1925)|
| 0:32:16| That's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Like we have a big area if somebody is walking toward the cashier, you watch him, you smell him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| and all the things we take in the class, and that will help them more, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1941)|
| 0:32:29| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Yes, you said earlier, sir, that you had a manager who wasn't sort of on top of it and you had gotten after him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1950)|
| 0:32:37| What is the status of that manager?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| Is he still with you or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| No, Amanda, now she's taken over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| No, I mean before that there was a guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| So now Amanda is going to be in charge of this and will keep a tighter rein on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| Hopefully we'll do our best, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| That's what we are here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| I notice in your papers you said that if employees ignore the obligation they have to check the IDs that they'll be terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1974)|
| 0:33:03| Is that part of the control?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Any other questions, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| Do you wish to add anything that you wish to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| No, I've talked with Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| I'm Mark Wood, Knoxville Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| I've talked with Rick and we've been very proactive, brainstorming what could be done, how to alleviate this problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2001)|
| 0:33:28| what could be done in the future, and he's been aggressively proactive in what he's going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| The classes that they're going to attend every six months and the manager's training, looking at the staff, a secret shopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2014)|
| 0:33:43| I mean proactive, over the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| I think this man wants to do business and I think he can be proud of the business he's going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| I just want to emphasize that, you know, in this history with your operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| what was most disappointing to me is that when the sale to minor occurred, the individual wasn't even carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| And the law in the city of Knoxville for off-premise sales is that everyone is carded for the sale of beer every time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2046)|
| 0:34:13| whether they look like they're 80 or that they look like they're 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| And that's what needs to be emphasized in your business is that everyone's carded every single time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| That's one of the points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| I'm sorry, I missed that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| I mean, I've said it dozens of times that a beer permit is a privilege, it's not a right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| and with that privilege comes a lot of responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| We'll be on the top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| If you put us under probation, we'll make sure that it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| Thank you for your time, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| Monterey Mexican Restaurant, 105 Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| You've got a light on there, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| I want to ask you a question before we go to the next one, and not on that particular one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| but they had, is there a number of citations if a business, and I don't see any business revoked, shut down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2099)|
| 0:35:09| but is there a certain number of this place at one each year, if you have two or three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2109)|
| 0:35:18| I believe the benchmark is three, that it automatically goes to an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| With three within a two-year period, it automatically goes to a suspension or revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| Two within a two-year period, they come here for an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2128)|
| 0:35:35| One within the two-year period, they have to file a remedial plan with the beer board clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2135)|
| 0:35:41| And there's fines associated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| And fines associated with all of those levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| But correct me if I'm wrong, but when they come to us, we do have the right to send them on to an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2146)|
| 0:35:53| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| Yes, sir, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| My name is David Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| I'm an attorney at 1810 Merchant Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| and I'm representing Monterey Mexican Restaurant, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| And with me are the owners, Daniel Perez and Ramon Oneg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| And I'd be certainly willing to assist in responding to the problem that we're here for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2170)|
| 0:36:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Well, you've sent us a lot of information on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| but I know you want to go ahead and tell us about, you know, what the plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2180)|
| 0:36:27| Sir, my clients have been operating Monterey Mexican Restaurant for 19 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| and it's only recently that any problems have ever occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| The most recent event was, quite frankly, a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| They did look at the ID card, but didn't pay enough attention to the date that was on the card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2201)|
| 0:36:49| to identify that he was dealing with a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2209)|
| 0:36:56| Part of what I've done to assist my clients in responding to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| and they were very kind in helping with making sure there was an interpreter there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| because they do have a series of employees whose primary language is Spanish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| although all of them speak some degree of English, to emphasize the importance of following the law in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2233)|
| 0:37:24| When I initially set this up, I was very concerned that the employees be aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| not just of their responsibilities to the Mexican restaurant and the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| but, quite frankly, that every one of them has a legal liability that could put them in jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| and that there's potential felony if they do it twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| I don't know that the underlying training, which seems to focus on the identification card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2266)|
| 0:37:55| sufficiently emphasizes the personal liability and responsibility of each employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2275)|
| 0:38:02| even though the corporation, and here my clients as owners, also bear a responsibility co-with their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2282)|
| 0:38:13| Certainly, minors should never have access to intoxicating drink of any sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2293)|
| 0:38:20| The law is there to protect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| But my clients on this individual who had made this error thought carefully about it and decided not to fire him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2303)|
| 0:38:34| At first, I did not necessarily agree with that, but I've come to believe that it was a far better lesson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| because he had to explain to all of his peers the several times he had to appear at General Sessions Court concerning this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2320)|
| 0:38:49| that he had to hire an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| Mike Lance did not provide an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| Or he was on his own on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| Because it was a personal responsibility issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| And I think that there was far greater attendance by the employees when they were at my training class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2342)|
| 0:39:10| because they were very aware that this had become a very serious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| I personally have come to believe that it's a mistake to fire the employee outright on a first event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2355)|
| 0:39:23| because one of the lessons learned is to give all of the employees a chance to understand the significant problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2363)|
| 0:39:33| It's like a DUI in some regards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| The initial arrest and event is nothing compared to the suspension of your driving privileges, potential loss of a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2376)|
| 0:39:48| There is a felony potential if you do this ever again, if convicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| And so all of these issues I address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| I also went in depth because I had an opportunity to go to the beer board to take a look at their top shelf program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2396)|
| 0:40:06| And I did amend my remediation plan to incorporate the top shelf program, which I thought was very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2406)|
| 0:40:14| Interestingly, the top shelf program, although very good training aid, does not sufficiently address certain identification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2414)|
| 0:40:23| such as the driver's license in the state of Tennessee, which are not allowed to be used for identification purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2423)|
| 0:40:30| and other forms of identification, which are actually illegal to be used by anyone for the purpose of purchasing beer or alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2430)|
| 0:40:42| I think it, quite frankly, is a trap by the state of Tennessee that they would issue a driver's license that cannot be used as a form of identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2442)|
| 0:40:52| However, for the purposes of being here today, my clients have put me on retainer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| and have asked me to continue with them for the next two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| We're going to hold this same lesson class six months from now and each six months during this period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| We want to put this behind us in a proactive manner so that my clients, quite frankly, don't have to stand here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2470)|
| 0:41:18| And those lessons learned, because they tend to be family members and long-term employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| will be retained within the Monterey Mexican Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| The 19 years that they had operated well should indicate the standard mistake was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2489)|
| 0:41:38| and they're being proactive about responding to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| I'll just editorialize on, you know, the fact that I don't think firing the employee after the first offense is effective either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2503)|
| 0:41:53| Because I know from 26 years of food service experience that they can walk five minutes down the road and get employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2513)|
| 0:42:00| And it doesn't solve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| They take that problem with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| So I think, you know, it lies on the backs of the folks that, you know, whoever's in charge of the training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2523)|
| 0:42:10| the owners or the management, you know, of the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| So, you know, I like the thought of, you know, let's train them instead of putting them out of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2533)|
| 0:42:20| And hopefully, you know, if they do it the second time, then maybe that's a different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| But, you know, I do like that approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| And, you know, you've been very proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| I don't think I've ever gotten as much information on the front end as I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| So, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| I think I brought this up before, but I think Councilman Roddy at one point brought forth some statistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2556)|
| 0:42:42| and information on that very point that you're better off retaining your employees because they've learned a lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| And that's valuable knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| And so I think you're right on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| And I'd just like to say, Mr. Hamilton, if your clients are as well versed and are taking the measures that you've pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2572)|
| 0:42:59| I think we're in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| I'll just quickly echo my colleague, Councilman Bailey, and Chairman Pavlis' compliments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| I think you've put forth a very robust and complete plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| And we wish that all of our folks that come before us in these administrative hearings would take their responsibility this seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2596)|
| 0:43:23| And I wish you the best of luck in implementing this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| It sounds like you've got the right steps in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| Thank you for being here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| Next is Smoky Mountain Grill and Brewery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2614)|
| 0:43:45| Is there anyone here from Smoky Mountain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2625)|
| 0:43:54| Rebecca, are you here for Smoky Mountain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| And, Chairman Pavlis, I had a question for them if they had been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| I know we have a slew of papers here, but I can't find an updated remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| They've turned nothing in to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| They have not paid their fine or a revised remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| We've heard nothing from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| That's all a problem for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| Not only that, but in both of their citations they have chosen not to card either time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| And that's a serious deal with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| Well, I mean, I don't think we have any option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| Well, I mean, one option is to bring them, make sure that they're notified and that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| we take this very seriously and want them to take it very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| that we would want them to show up at the September 20th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| I'll hold off on a motion on that for Vice Mayor Bailey and Councilwoman Palmer's suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2679)|
| 0:44:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| If we postpone this until September 20th and they do not come to that meeting, what option do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2690)|
| 0:44:58| Well, as we discussed earlier, I mean, you've always got the option to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2698)|
| 0:45:04| and send it directly to a, you know, administrative hearing, the hearing officers, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| We can do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| We can ask them to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| You know, those are, I don't know what other options that we would have outside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| Those are your options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| And meanwhile, they are continuing to operate and maybe they're carding or maybe they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2720)|
| 0:45:27| Is that pretty much it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| I'm just getting kind of a big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| I'm not sure how to respond to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| Well, I mean, we can't respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| I mean, the only thing, I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| You do have the capacity to go ahead and move tonight to send it to a suspension or revocation hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| or you can move to postpone it, or you can just forget about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| I wouldn't recommend that latter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| This citation occurred in February, and this is August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| and that seems like a long period of time between the citation and not hearing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2755)|
| 0:46:05| Well, I'm reluctant to, you know, to do anything terribly drastic at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| I don't want a business to continue to think, well, we can pretty much do what we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| because the beer board's not going to get excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| You know, just given eight years as chairman of this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| I've just got to think that there's something that has really gone bad here, that they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| I can't imagine that Popper Cellar Corporation would not take this seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| and I just think that something slipped through the cracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| I mean, that's just my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| I just can't imagine that they would put their business at risk in such a manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| I mean, that's just my personal opinion, and I'll recognize Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| Yes, Mr. Chairman, and I agree with those thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| and I was going to --I am going to make the motion to postpone it to the next regularly scheduled beer board because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| and I will take a personal ---- I will personally look into it and make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| see what's going on with them and make sure they're here the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| Just because I can't see for the glare, there's been folks come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| Has anyone come in from the Smoky Mountain Grill and Brewery by any chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| I'll call Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| It's a little late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| Is that the one at Turkey Curry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| So I make the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| Until?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| Next scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| September the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| That's a proper motion to accept, but we've got a discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| Councilwoman Roddy's line, I think, was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| I would like to recognize the recorder of the beer board and also the lieutenant from the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| In terms of the communication that they've had with this applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| there's some concern that adequate communication has not occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| and I know that they have records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| If they could share that with us, both of them, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| Well, they just handed it to me, and I was probably maybe a little bit premature on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| July the 6th, there was their kitchen manager was given a service of notice and order that was fully noted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2886)|
| 0:48:16| and signed for on July the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| And the notice was also sent in the mail to the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| Anything in addition from the police department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| I'm the one who actually served the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| You served the notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| I didn't have this in front of my bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| So they have been notified through the normal channels and also through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| And that mail is certified mail with a return receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| And the return receipt came back as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| That's hand-delivered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| Yeah, I was wondering, and maybe this is for Charles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| but do we have something the equivalent of an order to show cause why it shouldn't be sent to an administrative hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2931)|
| 0:48:58| Or is that just postponing until the next time, and that's really all it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| That's typically what, if you're going to postpone it to the next time, that's typically what happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| that it gets postponed and a new notice is sent out to the business saying it has been set for this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2946)|
| 0:49:14| and you need to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| So we do that through the notice process rather than some formal order to show cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| why you shouldn't be sent on to the next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| I could create something that would look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| Do the equivalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| Well, I mean, you know, I think the one thing that I've really liked about this board is that they're active| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| and that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| And, Councilman Devalopa, you've been a champion of running people down for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| to make sure that things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| And I'll take this upon myself, along with the Vice Mayor said he would as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| to contact their corporate offices and make sure that they understand that if this motion passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2985)|
| 0:49:52| that September the 20th, that somebody needs to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| Councilman Gray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| I would say that I second it for that reason that I'll personally take it on also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| So there's a proper motion that's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| Is there further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| The motion is to postpone this hearing, administrative hearing, until September the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| Those no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| Duly noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| So is there any further business to come before this board tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| If not, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110823?start=3024)|
