| 0:02:08| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| All right, the first order of business is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=129)|
| 0:02:20| I have a list of a few folks, but I think some of those will be delayed until zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| Manuela Ptacek, I believe she's going to be here for rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=146)|
| 0:02:36| Linda Holzclaw, it says teacher concerns, I'm assuming that'll be at 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=156)|
| 0:02:43| Tim Goddard, Bob Savory, I'm assuming they're all on the, all right, UK Minot, I think I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=163)|
| 0:02:54| saw UK here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=174)|
| 0:03:11| Mr. Minot, if you'll give your name and address for the record, please, sir, you have five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| UK Minot, 3816 Vicksburg Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=195)|
| 0:03:23| Mr. Chairman, I'm very upset with getting zoned into the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=203)|
| 0:03:33| I've got no use for the 6th District in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| I pay city taxes and have done so for 55 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=220)|
| 0:03:51| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| I've got five, four books, and it seems like every time you all have a meeting, your districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=233)|
| 0:04:02| change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| Now, there's something wrong somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| I don't know where it is or how to get it corrected, but I can tell you again, if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=247)|
| 0:04:16| stay where I'm at, they won't be any voting for me out of the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=256)|
| 0:04:24| I pulled this up on the computer, gives my address, 3816 Vicksburg Lane, Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=264)|
| 0:04:38| Carnes starts at the settlements and goes, I guess, north or south or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=278)|
| 0:04:49| It don't run east and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=289)|
| 0:04:55| But I don't know where you all have been corrected or not, and I don't know where the little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| school board member had anything to do with it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| But I noticed you all say that you wanted to line the school board up with the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=305)|
| 0:05:14| She was running for school board or elected for the 3rd District, but I noticed in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=314)|
| 0:05:21| last book that it's got the school board member and the commission chairman, the same district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=321)|
| 0:05:35| You've got the 9th District with a 9th District commissioner and a 1st District school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=335)|
| 0:05:43| member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| So like I said, I don't know who to do it or has done, but I had to call my doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=345)|
| 0:05:58| I had to check with rural metro, the fire department, to see if they knew where it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=358)|
| 0:06:05| not a Vicksburg Lane impound or Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| So I need you all to do something, and as quick as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=369)|
| 0:06:18| And that's all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=380)|
| 0:06:27| UK, thank you for coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=387)|
| 0:06:40| I don't really have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| I don't know the answer to your dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| The way these lines are drawn for people that have lived in communities their whole lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=408)|
| 0:06:55| and now are attached really kind of arbitrarily to other communities by way of this voting structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=415)|
| 0:07:04| You know, other than going back to how this was constituted, I don't know how to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=424)|
| 0:07:11| But I understand your frustration of being in really in the West Haven community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=431)|
| 0:07:19| and being labeled in Carnes, which is, you know, it's 15 miles away essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=439)|
| 0:07:26| Well, another concern, if I go to sell my house, anybody buying a house now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=446)|
| 0:07:37| the first thing they do is ask, what school district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=457)|
| 0:07:44| You could go out my front door and walk across Victor Ashe Park right into the Pleasant Ridge School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=464)|
| 0:07:52| But they've got the school district, Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| The kids have to go from where I live to Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| It's just something's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=482)|
| 0:08:09| Mr. Vardy, whenever the discussion was had about the redistricting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| the redistricting committee brought forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| I objected to that part of the fourth district coming or third district coming into the sixth district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=495)|
| 0:08:24| because I thought it would be a better fit for that sixth district to be in the Cedar Bluff-Middlebrook area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| And so that district was, you know, the addition made to my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| I believe everybody remembers the argument I had was that that community needs to stay intact with the third district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=514)|
| 0:08:41| And that's, you know, the schools determine what kids go to what school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=521)|
| 0:08:48| but the voting districts were determined by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| And I objected to West Haven and the parts of Cumberland Estates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| and Norwood coming into the sixth district because they're distinctively different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| But I was overruled in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| So nobody wanted to listen to me then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| Mr. Chairman, you all handle the purse for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=543)|
| 0:09:10| You ought to be in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| Instead of school board telling you what to do, you're the man at the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| You ought to tell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| Well, we don't determine where the kids go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| But I think that's, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| If you're paying the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| I objected to the redistricting as it was, but nobody would listen to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| What I'm saying, though, if you're paying your salary, they need to listen to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=571)|
| 0:09:38| Thank you, Mr. Monaghan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| Ms. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| Yes, I just wanted to say thank you for bringing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| And I would like to talk to you further about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| and maybe go over again the process we had in the joint redistricting committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| and how that all came about because, as it turned out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| the joint redistricting committee had settled on a redistricting plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=601)|
| 0:10:09| that we recommend to be recommended to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| but then the commission overruled that joint committee to vote in favor of a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| that was not recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| And so that's how this occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| And it was an unfortunate, it was unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| But I'll be happy to look into this further and discuss it some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=627)|
| 0:10:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=635)|

| 0:13:53| and be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to Dr. Harold A. Middlebrook, Sr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| and in so doing wish him all the very best in his retirement and all his future endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| You know, there's a lot of duties as we sit here as commissioners that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| but we do begrudgingly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| but this is truly one of the most special times that I've had in my time here sitting on Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=863)|
| 0:14:30| Had a first occasion to be introduced to Pastor Middlebrook while I was in high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=870)|
| 0:14:38| and I was just amazed that someone who was in the inner circle with Dr. King| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| throughout his civil rights efforts chose Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| I don't know why, but I'm glad he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| I'm glad he chose Knoxville to call home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| He has been an extremely valuable cog into all aspects, as you heard, you know, from our seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=895)|
| 0:15:03| You know, you look at Golden Ages, you look at Holston, Commissioner Wright's dad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=903)|
| 0:15:09| and I spent time there just truly an asset to all of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| The Martin Luther King celebration that we do here in Knoxville is one of the biggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| You go to other cities, it just doesn't get any better than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| It's due in part and parcel to Dr. Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| So it's my honor to tell you thank you for those years of service and ask you to keep it going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=928)|
| 0:15:50| Chairman, members of the commission, let me, to my commissioner and my friends who are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=950)|
| 0:15:58| many of you I have had the opportunity to work with in various areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| let me say first of all that I'm grateful to you for this consideration and this recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=964)|
| 0:16:12| My daughter stands with me, hopefully to kind of brace me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| Let me say that I am grateful to God and to the people of this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| for the opportunity to serve in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| No community is absolutely perfect, but when people make up their minds to work together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=987)|
| 0:16:36| to strive to find solutions to the various issues that we face in life today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=996)|
| 0:16:44| life can be better for the majority of the people of that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| It is my hope and my prayer that as many of you have continued to work for the good of the total community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1010)|
| 0:16:58| that you will not forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| Please don't forget the least, the left out, and those who would seem to be lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1021)|
| 0:17:10| And I pray that somehow as we struggle with the various areas that affect our lives today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1030)|
| 0:17:18| that impact our children for tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| that we will strive to find ways to make sure that those who are at the bottom of the economic rung| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1042)|
| 0:17:30| get a chance to move up to enjoy some of the better things of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| and that our children will be inspired to know that there is a better day tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1056)|
| 0:17:43| And tomorrow does not have to be yesterday, but we can make every day a good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1063)|
| 0:17:52| Thank you for your recognition, and I pledge to you and to this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| I have not died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| I've just retired from pastoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| But this community is dear to me, our three children, our grandchildren,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| and now we are rearing two great-grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| We'll be here so that wherever they are, I'll be there pushing and striving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| And so if you get a call from me saying you didn't quite get it right this time, let's work on it a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1102)|
| 0:18:30| It's because I love this community and because I'm grateful to God that we can work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1110)|
| 0:18:37| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Thank all of you for this recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| Thank you, Dr. Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Mr. Chairman, could we take a brief recess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| so that the commission can have their picture with Dr. Middlebrook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| I think that would be appropriate if that would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1131)|
| 0:19:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1161)|
| 0:19:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1191)|
| 0:20:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1222)|
| 0:20:43| Are we going to deviate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| I don't think Fulton Band, Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| I was going to add that the band, of course, the kids are still in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| and then the band actually has a meeting bringing in new band members after school today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| so they won't be able to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| The football team is coming at 445.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| We're going to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| I think West High School is the only school that's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| so we're going to move that item up on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| Go ahead and take care of West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| Oh, actually, we need to take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| We had a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| So now the next resolution for West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| Resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, honoring the West High School football team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| Motion to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| We're reading the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| You were reading the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Whereas the West High School football team recently played in the TSSAA Class 5A State Championship game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| that fell short in a tight game against Henry County with a final score of 28-27,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| and whereas remarkably this West High School football team is the first team in the school's history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| to play in the state championship game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| and whereas the West High School football team finished this season with a stellar 13-2 record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| and whereas Head Coach Scott Cummings, together with his assistant coaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| provided leadership and direction for the team's successful season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| and whereas all 86 team members, including 24 seniors, should be applauded for their outstanding effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| and performance this season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| and whereas the West High School football team's hard work, commitment to teamwork, talent, and perseverance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| were all contributing factors to their winning season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| The Commission of Knox County hereby honors and congratulates the West High School football team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| for an outstanding 2013 season and their tremendous effort in the Class 5A State Championship game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1352)|
| 0:22:39| Be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to the West High School football team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| and Coach Scott Cummings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| Mr. Orlenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| Thank you, Chairman and fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| I'm a former alumni of West High, and my years at West wasn't as celebrated, I guess, on the football field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1382)|
| 0:23:13| But ever since Coach Cummings has taken over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| he has turned this program into one of the elite programs in Knox County, and as now the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1397)|
| 0:23:25| So, and if I remember correctly, this past season his only two losses are to two state champions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1405)|
| 0:23:33| So, he's done a wonderful job, and the players and the other coaching staff have just worked hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1413)|
| 0:23:41| and I thought this was a good recognition for them for all the hard work that they've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| over the last four or five years that Scott has been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| So, I just wanted to thank them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| We appreciate the recognition, and I accept it on behalf of a great, great group of kids at West High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1436)|
| 0:24:03| that have worked very, very hard over the last many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| and the establishment of some culture there has been wonderful for our school in the hallways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| and in the cafeterias and in the classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| Our kids sit in the first two rows of their classes as a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| and attend study hall every week during the season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| and there's a lot of character building that has led to, fortunately, some winning for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| But we look forward to continuing at this coming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| and we're real proud of what we've accomplished, but we're going to continue to strive forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| But thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Thank you, Coach Cummings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| Thank you, Commissioner Owen, for bringing this forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| and Coach Cummings and your associates for coming in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| I asked to be added to this because I have a 16-year-old at West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| and therefore I went to all the games, the home games, a couple of the road games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| I didn't make the one down in Cookville that was at nine degrees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| but I did make the one after Thanksgiving, and that was about 20 degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| But what a joy to have November high school football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| Usually it's over so much earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| Looking at the roster, I noticed that I think most of your big guns are coming back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| so let's make it a 15-0 next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1517)|
| 0:25:24| Just wanted to say thanks to Scott and his staff also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| It's a major, I mean, it's just really amazing what he's done with this football program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| Of course, I graduated and played football and taught at West High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| and all the years, and, of course, when we were playing, I think we won 12 games in four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1539)|
| 0:25:46| They won 13 games this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| And so we went from just, you know, we were just a skeleton of a program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| and now they've got just horses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| You know, this is a major program in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| It's an amazing accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| So I just wanted to say thanks to them and wish them the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1564)|
| 0:26:13| Am I correct at Webb, high school's not here, Fulton Band and Fulton Football are not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| So I just wanted to leave them out, I think, until 4 or 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| All right, we're going to go ahead and move into the regular commission agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1583)|
| 0:26:31| You can call the roll again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=1591)|

| 0:45:53| All right, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Yes, I need to recuse myself from any discussion on this item and also recuse myself from voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| I appreciate you bringing that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| And I would just ask you for a definition of procedural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| So would that include data processing or just paper flow or paperwork?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| Or can you be a little more specific there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| So that knows where to get directed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| It would have to be a specialized audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| Money is not missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| Yeah, it has nothing to do with the forensics audit or any money thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| Andrea, do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| A procedural audit would look at the process from start to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| So where it begins and then how all the inputs and information flows to the final result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2799)|
| 0:46:47| So we could identify any control gaps or risk areas that would need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2807)|
| 0:46:53| So that's how a normal procedural audit, we would design it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| And this will include both clerk's office, attorney general's office, the judicial, the branches of the judicial side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2817)|
| 0:47:07| So this will include the whole gamut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| It doesn't just focus on one particular office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| It's the whole criminal justice process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| And would it be directed at you or Andrea or whoever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| Internally done or externally by a – because I think it's come up in our audit meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| And a few companies have been standing there, and they say, well, we couldn't do something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| We know people that can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| So I'm just wondering who would be the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| It would come out of our office, our internal audit office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| Andrea is comfortable with her experience with TVA and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| And with contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| And so I think she's pretty comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| So it wouldn't be any extra additional contracts or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| No costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| So we have a motion on the floor with an amendment and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| 906 on page 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| Approving a grant contract in the amount of $1,539.61 with the State of Tennessee, Department of State,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2884)|
| 0:48:11| Division of Elections for the purpose of purchasing a computer, printer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| and software for the Knox County Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| And I got this from Mr. Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| He needed this to go ahead and pay some bills that come due based on this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| So I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| Other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| Spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| The Knox County Mayor's order appointing George Abo to the Lenore City Utilities Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2922)|
| 0:48:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| Discussion regarding teacher's revolt and superintendent's contract, which will be heard at 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| And discussion regarding the Joint Education Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| Do you want to hold that until you want to make that part of the process, or do you want to go ahead and give an update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| We can give an update now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| I think I'm going to defer after a second to Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| I'm sure Commissioner Burroughs and Wright may want to say something as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| because this month's meeting was moved up 30 minutes, and I didn't read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2952)|
| 0:49:19| I got the memo, but I didn't read the memo, so I ended up missing the first 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| In terms of things covered, we spent a lot of time talking about the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2965)|
| 0:49:33| We actually got a prelude to the results of the survey and some of those aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2973)|
| 0:49:41| So they actually hadn't presented it formally to the school board at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2981)|
| 0:49:48| so we really didn't dig too deeply into it, but they gave us a synopsis of the results of the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2988)|
| 0:49:56| And I guess with that, I'll turn it over to Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| I know Commissioner Burroughs, Commissioner Wright probably want to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| Most of the meeting was spent about the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| He presented the results, and he's going to be doing that again at our retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| We also talked about the retreat and some of the things that would be discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| and our commission chair and board chair are going to get, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| have already gotten together to address some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| But one of the things we talked about was the area of contention seems to be between commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| and the schools is the budget and money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| That seems to be number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| And so those are some of the things that we want to talk about is that budgeting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| how we can get input as we go through this next budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| And there was also discussion about whether or not we should continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| because the contract with the person who is doing the mediation is up in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| And so we'll meet in February to determine how we want to proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| if we want to proceed further with him and how we want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| I think it's been helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| In the beginning, it was a little rough going, but I think we've smoothed that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| and I think we've shown that we can get together, we can talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| and we can be frank with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| So I see value in the committee as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| And so I'm looking forward to the retreat that we're going to have on the 7th and 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| because I know that the school board is interested in bringing up some issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| and I know that we're interested in talking about some things as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| Amy, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| Yes, another thing that came up, and I know this was touched on briefly last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| and I apologize for not being here for that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| But, you know, one of the reasons that we formed this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| was to create a better working relationship between the two bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| And I think that we are making progress there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| And it's not to make light of any of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3112)|
| 0:51:58| It's not to sweep anything under the rug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| But it's to address them head on and in an open and honest way with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3122)|
| 0:52:10| And I feel like we've got the support of the rest of the commission in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3130)|
| 0:52:17| And as Commissioner Hammond said, it was a little rocky going at first, but we're making progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3137)|
| 0:52:23| And I think that's a very good thing for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| I think we know that the public likes it when we are getting along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3147)|
| 0:52:35| And one of the things that was mentioned is the way that sometimes we are so passionate about these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3155)|
| 0:52:47| and so passionate about what's going on with our kids and what's going on with our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3167)|
| 0:52:54| and what's going on with the school board that we can sometimes not choose our words as carefully as perhaps we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3174)|
| 0:53:03| And that makes the whole process more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| Not that we're trying to, as I said, make light of anything or not take something as seriously as we ought to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3189)|
| 0:53:18| But one of the things that I've learned working through this process with this committee is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3198)|
| 0:53:25| is our goal to make the system better and what's the best way to reach that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3205)|
| 0:53:38| And this is something that most of us up here have done at one time or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| I know I certainly have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| But I would like for us all to, we can stand in our truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3226)|
| 0:53:53| and we can speak from our heart without needing to use belittling language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3233)|
| 0:54:00| or without needing to make things more difficult than they need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3240)|
| 0:54:13| And so I would like for all of us to take more care in how we address each other between the commission and the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3253)|
| 0:54:24| and make sure that our teachers feel like they're being heard, make sure that we do hear them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3264)|
| 0:54:33| as well as be respectful of the process that the school board and the superintendent are going through in trying to address these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3273)|
| 0:54:41| This is something that's been brewing for a long time and it's not going to be resolved overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3281)|
| 0:54:50| So I would just like us all to kind of be a little more mindful, perhaps, of the way that we state things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3290)|
| 0:55:00| And, again, I'm speaking from my own experience as much as from what I've heard anyone else say or do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3300)|
| 0:55:09| And that's something that I've learned working with these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| And I hope that we can all be a little more mindful of that going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| to try to choose our words just a bit more carefully so that the process is as productive as it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3319)|
| 0:55:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| The joint, the small joint committee does meet on the 6th, the day before the joint retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3333)|
| 0:55:42| And that's up to you all if you all want to meet that day or I mean we're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| I think we decide to keep that meeting on the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| And, you know, as Commissioner Hammond alluded to, I don't know where we'll go once this, the contract for Steve goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3350)|
| 0:56:01| But in terms of the four of us, we'll be looking for feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| If you all like, you know, like I said, I've been trying to give fairly detailed notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| And the rest of the committee has done a great job of giving those kind of detailed results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3371)|
| 0:56:17| But if this is something that you think is moving the county forward, if you think it's helping with the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3377)|
| 0:56:24| and there will be other things, we actually have more things on our agenda that we probably won't get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| get to in terms of this facilitated discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| But if you have any ideas, whether you want to continue with the unpaid facilitator, current paid facilitator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3392)|
| 0:56:40| get rid of the facilitator, we figure something else out, kind of give us that feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| because we are a non-policy making body, but you all asked us to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| and we definitely are serving at the pleasure of this body and the pleasure of the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3411)|
| 0:56:58| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| I guess I have just some questions about the retreat, first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| I don't know that we've received any information about its structure or how it's going to be, how it's going to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3427)|
| 0:57:17| The last time we had a retreat, you know, personally I thought it was a marginal benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3437)|
| 0:57:26| especially for the expense and the time that was required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3446)|
| 0:57:35| And so I guess I think the body needs or I'd like to have more information about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3455)|
| 0:57:42| at least the structure, who's going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| I sort of felt like one of the objections that I had to the last retreat is that it was more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3465)|
| 0:57:53| or less orchestrated by the school administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| That's my own personal view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| And I thought that was inhibiting to the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| And so if it was my preference, you know, it would be us and the school board in the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3486)|
| 0:58:13| rather than, you know, the administration there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| And some of the folks that are related to the administration conducting part of the sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3498)|
| 0:58:28| So I just thought that was not productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| I'll tell you, and we haven't sat down and I know the topics we're going to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3513)|
| 0:58:38| and it was my suggestion with Lynn that we not have a facilitator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| that we have her and I facilitating each discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| And I thought that was important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| And so we do have a few folks coming in on Friday night after dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| We'll have Jared Bigum, who is with SCORE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| who I went to a meeting where he discussed and talked about curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| and talked about standards and talked about what's coming from the federal, state, local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| And so we're going to have that discussion on Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| Saturday morning we're going to talk about the budgeting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| Chris and McPherson are coming to discuss how they get together on the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| and where they work through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| And then we're going to talk about teacher survey after that, myself and Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| And then there was one other topic, and it's escaping me right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| and we'll break from there after lunch on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| We'll be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| And so that's kind of the meat and potatoes of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| But there may be, you know, if something needs to change, that may be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| But those are the main topics we're going to discuss over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| Time to kick off on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| Five-thirty, going to gather at five-thirty, dinner at six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| and then we'll leave after lunch on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| So it'll be at RT's like it was the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| I didn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| I have to leave early on Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| No one can hear you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| I have a previous engagement on Friday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| I'll be leaving early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| But we'll be back Saturday at 8 o'clock, starting at 8 o'clock Saturday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| I really only have one question that I'd like to have answered that whole weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3622)|
| 1:00:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| Commissioner Brolles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| So what I think I'm hearing Tony say is that he felt like last time maybe the retreat was a little too orchestrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3635)|
| 1:00:45| and maybe there wasn't enough room for input from the two bodies as to what was going to be discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3645)|
| 1:00:53| and how it was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| And I know that you and Lynn have worked very hard to put this together, and we all appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| But I'm wondering if there's some way that individual commissioners could maybe email you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3661)|
| 1:01:09| like Mike said he's got one question he wants answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| and maybe there are others of us who have something that we want to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| Could we possibly email that to you and Lynn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| Yeah, and I asked for that last month, as a matter of fact, and I got some response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| But, yeah, and we'll have at least some built-in time hopefully for just open discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| and open dialogue and just lay some stuff on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| Yeah, and that's what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| I mean, this retreat is what we make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| I do agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| It was hard last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| I think we needed a facilitator because, like Commissioner Hammond and Brolles mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3700)|
| 1:01:47| it took us a while as a committee to get to start having a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| But I think we're there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| I think we know what our issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| So the issue with the surveys actually came from the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3716)|
| 1:02:02| I mean, we wanted a deeper dive, so that's what we asked the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| someone from his staff, someone from the school board, whomever, the right faces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| to give us a deeper evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| This is before the whole, you know, the second survey went out and started making headlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| We asked for a deeper evaluation of what the surveys mean and what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3742)|
| 1:02:29| And so that was our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| In fact, the school board, they really don't want to be present for that because they've heard it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| And they can, you know, talk about something, maybe maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| You know, that's what we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| We have other duties besides school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| So this agenda, I think the two chairs have been active with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3763)|
| 1:02:50| They've solicited our information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| So hopefully it's going to be more than just, you know, a lip service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| It will be a good dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| So, you know, like last time, we talked about what we want it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| I mean, if it's not top 10% or whatever, let's say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| Let's say what our realistic goals are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| Let's not go pie in the sky and we're not really, you know, meaning it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| So I'm looking forward to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| They may have heard the survey results from the spin doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3804)|
| 1:03:32| But when you analyze some of these results, it ain't exactly like it's been purported to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3812)|
| 1:03:40| Now, I'm a country boy, but I didn't come to town on no load of gourds last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3820)|
| 1:03:47| But I can take a bunch of figures and you tell me what answer you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| and I can figure you out that answer down to that last penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| And that's what we're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| We're getting spun around the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3837)|
| 1:04:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| Just one more thing, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| Obviously, the whole idea of the formation or to have a retreat has been considered for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3849)|
| 1:04:18| We haven't, of course, just in the last weeks or a few days, now we have this elephant in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3858)|
| 1:04:26| And, of course, I think as much as we want to cover certain topics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3866)|
| 1:04:34| there needs to be some time spent on that elephant and that being the teacher unrest, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3874)|
| 1:04:42| And so I know that will be broached relative to the survey, but I hope it's not limited to the survey results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3882)|
| 1:04:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| Will the superintendent be present the whole time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| We haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| I mean, it's a public meeting, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| We determine the content, and so we determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| I mean, just from what I'm hearing here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| it sounds like some people maybe just want to speak freely with him not being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3914)|
| 1:05:15| Is that what all the cameras are going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| So, you know, he may be there, but, you know, I told Lynn that we need to be careful that it's our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3919)|
| 1:05:27| But he needs to be part of the discussion in regards to the teacher survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| and what the administration and the board are going to do with those results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| I think that's critical that he's there for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| And so I'm not going to try to stop anybody from being there, but I don't think he's going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| Lynn and I will control the content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| We're going to have the discussion in regards to the audit committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| I think Ed was leading that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3951)|
| 1:05:59| We've had several, well, last Tuesday at our 1130 meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| they discussed various things on the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| I think it got them resolved positively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| There was one issue late in the meeting, and I wanted, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| we didn't get it in depth last week because Mr. Brawls wasn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| I wanted her to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| She made a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| This is concerning the most productive use of Andrea, our new auditor's, time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3980)|
| 1:06:27| And it seemed to be a conflict with a point of view that Commissioner Brown had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3987)|
| 1:06:33| And as I said earlier, Commissioner Wright and I did not, I don't think, put an opinion out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| And that would be should she attend all the commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| Obviously, today there was audit things on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| Many times they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| And there's just a difference of opinion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| And I'd like to hear from Commissioner Brown and Commissioner Brawls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| and then let commission sort of arbitrate it, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4013)|
| 1:07:02| Ladies first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| Go ahead, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| I think a good, you know, kind of hopefully to begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| for the majority in the conversation, if there's no audit items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| or if a commissioner would desire to have the auditor at a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| send her an e-mail or send the chairman an e-mail and just request that she be there for a certain item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| and then she can go about her way into her business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| That was pretty much what I talked about at the audit committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| that, you know, we're used to having the internal auditor here sitting back there during the whole meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4053)|
| 1:07:40| pretty much doing nothing when there's a lot of work in the office that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| And she's right here in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| And so if something comes up, it's really easy just to call her up and say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| can you run down here and answer a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| But I hate to monopolize her valuable time by making her sit through these meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4075)|
| 1:08:02| when it's really not necessary for her to be here unless we're addressing something related to internal audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4082)|
| 1:08:09| And, again, anything that this commission desires that the internal auditor look into deeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4089)|
| 1:08:18| first has to go through the audit committee anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| So it's not like we can turn around and say, hey, Andrea, I want you to go take a look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| you know, in the middle of a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| We've got a process in place for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| So I just don't want to be respectful of her and her staff's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| and not require them to be here if they really don't need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4117)|
| 1:08:45| Anything else in regard to audit, Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| My only reason is the fact that we have a lot of directors sitting over there at our meeting every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4131)|
| 1:08:59| There are things that do come up from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| Maybe they've got a different perspective on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| Maybe we're trying to do something that changed something we shouldn't be changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| because she can see how that would affect something else down the line that we can't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4147)|
| 1:09:13| So, I mean, it's up to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| I mean, you know, she wants to come, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| But while I've got the microphone, did you announce earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4159)|
| 1:09:26| has anybody heard from Bud as far as how his wife did with her surgery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| I don't have a clue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| I don't really see the information on the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| No, I don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| I haven't spoken to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| Any other issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| In this same paragraph, if we're sort of steering away from the audit committee yet, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| But I guess what I don't want to do is send a mixed message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| I mean, if Fondra and her evaluation of her job chooses to come to every meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| I don't see that as being a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| And I'm not saying that that's what we're saying, but I think if we're saying don't come to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| she may take it and say, okay, they don't want me at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| There may be some ancillary things that she can chime in on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| You know, we're discussing county business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| We're discussing county dollars every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| I guess we meet twice a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| I don't see why this is a huge burden for her or her representative to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4225)|
| 1:10:32| I know they're a fairly small department, but, you know, again, I'd like to make it more, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4232)|
| 1:10:42| I'm struggling with saying, you know, if we're saying it's not mandatory and not just it's the position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4242)|
| 1:10:49| it's not a current in the auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| I mean, but ultimately we're her employer, so they can get a chance to interact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| But a couple times a month, I just don't see it being a huge burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| Our average meeting, two to five tops maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| You know, so we're talking six to ten hours a month in terms of sit down in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| So I guess I just don't see where this is a huge vacuum of her time and her efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4272)|
| 1:11:22| But that's one person's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| Andrew, can you be doing some other work while you're here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| I mean, can you have an ear to what we're doing and still be doing some other things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| I don't know what your job entails, but I would think you could still be protective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| I mean, it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4301)|
| 1:11:47| Commissioner Burles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4307)|
| 1:11:54| I think we've hired a first class internal auditor, and I think she best knows how to use her time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4314)|
| 1:12:01| And so I think that we need to leave it up to her discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| We publish our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| She can read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| She knows if there's something coming up that she can give input on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| So I would like to trust her judgment in whether or not she and her staff need to be here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4332)|
| 1:12:19| I think that she's perfectly capable of making that determination on her own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| There may be times that she feels like she needs to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| and there may be times that she feels that she doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| Regardless, she's close by and available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| So, basically, I'd like to just let her make that determination on her own in terms of what's best for her and her staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4353)|
| 1:12:42| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| The comment was made about the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| We might call upon him at any moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| Well, in fact, he's eyeballing me now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| But we may not call on the internal auditor once in any given hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| So I believe that there's something, some merit to be weighed, whether the internal auditor is here at our meeting or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4377)|
| 1:13:05| Really, what I was going to do is bend the conversation for just a second because I added on to it a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4385)|
| 1:13:11| if we're finished with that subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| Everybody else on audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| The word, the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| At the last audit committee meeting, it was brought up that there were current articles in the media about the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4401)|
| 1:13:36| looking at the results of the internal hotline, fraud, waste and abuse hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4416)|
| 1:13:47| I think it takes a moment for us to back up and view what caused us to have an audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4427)|
| 1:13:53| and also what caused us to have that internal fraud, waste and abuse hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4433)|
| 1:14:02| They're both directives unfunded by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| I'm not saying that they need to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| I'm saying we need to realize where the requirement came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| The ethics committee has been with us for some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| and it revolves around a certain limited scope of criteria related to campaign contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4458)|
| 1:14:30| and whatever and whatever and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| That's the basis for the ethics committee for which Knox County is responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4472)|
| 1:14:38| and for which we've set up the rules and regulations of how it's appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| and who's on it and how its membership is established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4482)|
| 1:14:51| The hotline's a different animal in that it was established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| or we were directed by the state to establish it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| and it has some criteria which we, county commission, deal with by getting the audit committee to do the legwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4499)|
| 1:15:11| And as I see those two different processes established right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4511)|
| 1:15:16| there isn't anything downstream from us, the city and county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| that opens a doorway between those two separate processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| So having said that, I believe it is just my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| and it comes back before commission to say that the fraud, waste and abuse hotline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4533)|
| 1:15:39| the hotline is watched after on behalf of commission by the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4539)|
| 1:15:48| And if someone feels differently about the information that is generated by the hotline, we need to discuss it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4548)|
| 1:16:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| Commissioner, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| I'm doing this just a little bit off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| but I thought that we voted, when we redid the charter for the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| that they would look predominantly at conflicts of interest and gifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| That's what they were established to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| And that's what they were established to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| And, I mean, I think if something came across the hotline that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| did you know that Swinsell's brother, you know, got this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| and that could be someone's cousin, you know, that could, I think, go to the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| It's not that things are totally exclusive there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| Or if someone called in and said, did you know that someone took a trip and this vendor with the county paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4595)|
| 1:16:43| You know, I think that was something that, even though it might be screened by the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4603)|
| 1:16:49| if that's the one who's doing it or the law director, but that would be a proper, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| in my opinion, would be a proper referral to the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| But other than that, the, you know, the ethics committee is limited in the scope of what they look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| And basically what I'm doing, Commissioner Riders, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4622)|
| 1:17:10| I take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| Can you bring the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4635)|
| 1:17:21| There's some things we don't want to hear, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| I'll tell you, you know, this is true, and it was designed for those two purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4643)|
| 1:17:30| But if this body chose, right now it's at the audit committee because that's the only one that legally can handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4650)|
| 1:17:38| But if this body chose for those calls to be investigated by the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4658)|
| 1:17:48| then we would have to have a new charter, new rules and regs set up for the ethics committee before they could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4668)|
| 1:17:57| So the first thing that has to happen, if you want that done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| is that this body wants the ethics committee to do that job versus the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4681)|
| 1:18:09| And then we can make rules and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| But to the list of body votes to have the ethics committee do it, you know, we're just all in the wind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4692)|
| 1:18:21| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| Dave, correct me if I'm wrong, but that's actually legally rather if this body wanted to do that or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4704)|
| 1:18:35| legally we are constrained from doing that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4715)|
| 1:18:39| This is strictly a function of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| And regardless of what this body wanted to do, we would be in violation of state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| State law required the county commission to set up an audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| That's step one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| State law then came along and said that we had to have this confidential fraud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| and waste hotline to be administered to by the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| So that's state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| So I don't think that this commission can change that state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4747)|
| 1:19:13| We've done what we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| The ethics committee was created by state law, not the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| but we had to have an ethics ordinance, which we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4759)|
| 1:19:25| We have an ethics committee as part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| We didn't have to under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| For instance, MTAS, we took the CTAS model, modified it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| What MTAS did for the municipalities, they don't have a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| They just have an ethics officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| We're in compliance with state law now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| and I don't think you can cross the lines under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| Any other discussion on those items, audit or ethics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4794)|
| 1:19:55| We are in recess until 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| We'll try to take over as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4801)|
| 1:20:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| We'll call the meeting back to order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| and we'll go ahead and have a roll call just to bring us back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| Mr. Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| Mr. Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4826)|
| 1:20:27| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| Mr. Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| Here's the format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| We're kind of in a discussion mode from 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| We'll call up the list of folks that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| It will be five minutes for each person when you come forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| And then at about 445, 450, we will be having a stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4846)|
| 1:20:53| We've got some honorariums that we need to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| that we need to stop for the Webb High School and Fulton football,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4859)|
| 1:21:04| if the Fulton shows up for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| And so we will stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| And then, again, at 5 o'clock we have to stop for zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| It's a noticed zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| We'll stop as close to 5 o'clock as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| And Commissioner Norman, do you have something or are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| I've got the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| Do you want to start the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| Thank you, those teachers that have shown up today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4891)|
| 1:21:36| to especially express some of their feelings about what's been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| I did want to say a couple of things about the item for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4902)|
| 1:21:48| First of all, the item came to my mind based on our last month's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4908)|
| 1:21:57| where we were unable to discuss the superintendent's contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4917)|
| 1:22:04| Because of our so-called consent decree, of course, we can't discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4924)|
| 1:22:11| We can only approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| And so that, just in and of itself, is a troublesome thing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4934)|
| 1:22:22| As I said in the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| I think one of these days there will be a modification of that in some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| or a reconsideration of that consent decree that allows us at least some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4948)|
| 1:22:34| flexibility to talk about things and maybe participate in a more vital way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4954)|
| 1:22:43| The other aspect of this that I wanted to mention before we start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4963)|
| 1:22:49| the teachers coming forward, is that I guess the other reason for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4969)|
| 1:22:56| is that I'd just like to convey a sense of hope to teachers that I consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4976)|
| 1:23:07| have been abused, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| It's just a form of abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| Teachers that have spent many years in preparation to do well in their profession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=4993)|
| 1:23:26| are under duress, extreme duress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| Teachers – so those teachers that are on the edge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| those are the ones that I want to convey a sense of hope to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| Those that are just about to call it quits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| They've just had enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| They can't take it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| And so I hope they'll hang in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| I hope those of you that have been skipped over for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5029)|
| 1:23:55| what I'd consider very unfair incentive pay system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| those of you whose licensure is threatened by a very arbitrary set of standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5039)|
| 1:24:12| and attempts to quantify, those of you that are afraid you're going to lose your job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| based on those same sets of data because it says you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5059)|
| 1:24:27| The policy says you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| I want you to hang in there. Hang tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| This isn't over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| We're just getting started about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| Knox County is the epicenter for this state and what's taking place in this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5077)|
| 1:24:46| People are fed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| You're going to have a lot more support, so hang tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| Just a real point of clarification from the law department, a simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5099)|
| 1:25:07| Can we discuss school board items that appear on our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| Yes, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| And it's a sincere question because I really know we can't vote to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| or approve what we vote to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| but we can discuss them in as much detail as we would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| Here's the way it works, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| The consent agreement doesn't prevent that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| You can ask the superintendent or anybody any question about superintendent contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5132)|
| 1:25:39| or the way they're spending money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5139)|
| 1:25:40| We can't tell them how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| But the way it happens is, and I think Dave Wright did it one time, was it came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5143)|
| 1:25:49| and it was a grant, but we were having to fund a matching grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| And he did not vote to put it on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| And that's you have that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| And once it's not voted to put on consent, then it can be discussed openly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| If it's on consent, you vote to put it on consent, you then can't take it off of consent, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5165)|
| 1:26:12| between the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| But certainly, if you don't want it, vote for it for consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| and you want to hear it at the full session, you have that authority and that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5183)|
| 1:26:24| What we're going to do is 435.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| Coach Savory, if you'll come forward, Bob Savory's first five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| We're going to have two speakers, and then we'll get to Fulton and Webb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| and then we'll get back to the teachers, and then we'll go to zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| Coach Savory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5196)|
| 1:26:37| My name is Bob Savory, 9320 Camrose Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5197)|
| 1:26:44| This is my 28th year as a Knox County teacher, my 31st as a high school classroom teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5204)|
| 1:26:51| And I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| I realize your role in public education is mostly financial in nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5214)|
| 1:26:59| but I believe what we have to say here tonight will be useful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| and hopefully be a wise use of your precious time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| I realize it's already been a long day for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| and I want to tell you how much we truly appreciate your public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| Ladies and gentlemen, my wife of nearly 26 years often tells me I don't communicate well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5233)|
| 1:27:20| She tells me it takes a fairly heated conversation with elevated voice levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| to get me to truly listen and understand what she's been trying to tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| in a more pleasant manner all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| I'm not so sure what's happening in Knox County education system right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| is not that same type of communication problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| I guess it sometimes takes a revolt to get people to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5263)|
| 1:27:49| Often in Knox County, the media and those in the public eye will give their version of the truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5269)|
| 1:27:54| and expect the general public to accept it as full fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| I'm sure Dr. McIntyre tonight will give you a rosy version of what's going on in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5278)|
| 1:28:05| Mike Edwards today had a letter in the Knoxville News Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| His letter and his content match several I've read in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| It's odd how my year-and-a-half research on Common Core Standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5293)|
| 1:28:17| doesn't match what he and others are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| Their half-truths and misunderstandings are contributing to what I believe is a crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| in public education that will hurt Knox County students in a powerful way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5306)|
| 1:28:33| Please rest assured I don't use the word crisis lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| I'm 60 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| I've lived long enough to understand when and where to use that kind of term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5320)|
| 1:28:46| A crisis situation is often defined by people based on their life experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5326)|
| 1:28:53| At age 17, I had to witness the aftermath of my father's suicide to convince my mother that he was dead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5333)|
| 1:29:01| and we could do nothing to save him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| At 28, I was roped to two other climbing partners on Mount McKinley's Carson's Ridge in a terrible storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5344)|
| 1:29:11| The knife-edge ridge has drop-offs on both sides of 1,800 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| The temperature was well below zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| and we were just waiting for the next gust of 60- to 80-mile-an-hour wind to blow us off the mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5359)|
| 1:29:25| You see, I don't use the term crisis lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5365)|
| 1:29:31| Several of my fellow teachers will speak to the parts of this crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| but rest assured we would not be taking the time away from our families to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| if we didn't believe someone needs to be protecting our students from ideas and policies that are just plain wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5380)|
| 1:29:50| Policies and ideas that Dr. McIntyre and others are pushing full board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5390)|
| 1:29:57| Brad, you and I recently spoke about your daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| You were trying to decide if public school or a Christian private school might be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| I hate to say this, but if Knox County fully implements Common Core, my opinion, any alternative would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5406)|
| 1:30:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| Thank you, Coach Savery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| Coach, Coach Savery, quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5421)|
| 1:30:26| Did you go to the University of Tennessee in wildlife management?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| I was there with you, I think, one year behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| But I have always watched you through over all the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| You've always been outspoken and always been an advocate for the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| And I admire you for the stand that you've taken in all the years past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| I have noticed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5441)|
| 1:30:42| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| And I'm teaching wildlife now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| I've been teaching wildlife for 14 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| I thought you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5449)|
| 1:30:50| All right, the next person on the list, Tim Goddard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5450)|
| 1:30:56| Tim Goddard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| I will come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| We'll follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| Linda Holtzclaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5462)|
| 1:31:09| Ms. Holtzclaw, just to remind you, five minutes and a name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| My name is Linda Holtzclaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| My address is 7726 Trophy Run Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5475)|
| 1:31:22| Thank you for allowing us to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| I would like to start with a list of names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| Pat Farley, Donna Hall, Teresa Brown, K.J. Folk, Eloise Weaver, Linda Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5487)|
| 1:31:37| These are all teachers who have retired in the past two years from my school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| not because they were ready to retire or didn't want to teach anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5501)|
| 1:31:47| but because they were tired of being disrespected, devalued, undermined, unappreciated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5507)|
| 1:31:54| and viewed as the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| They were not teachers with low test or evaluation scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| In fact, some of them had the highest scores in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| The 170 years of expertise we have lost in their leaving can never be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5525)|
| 1:32:12| And with the results of the recent teacher survey, we can expect to keep losing experienced teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5532)|
| 1:32:19| In the past few months, teachers have spoken out about the assault on public education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| in an unprecedented fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| In my 30 years of teaching, I have never witnessed an outcry from educators as is happening now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5547)|
| 1:32:35| Teachers are not against being evaluated nor teaching more rigorous standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5555)|
| 1:32:42| Teachers are against being evaluated with data that has nothing to do with instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5562)|
| 1:32:49| and having to teach standards that are developmentally inappropriate for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5569)|
| 1:32:55| Had these business people bothered to ask an educator about common core standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5575)|
| 1:33:02| before implementing them, we could have advised on the level of rigor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| We are not the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| We are the advocates for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| We are on the front lines with them every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| We are experts in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| However, in the past few years, we have been blamed for almost every issue in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5599)|
| 1:33:26| Our children are not data and numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5606)|
| 1:33:30| They are more than test scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| Teachers are more than evaluation scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5613)|
| 1:33:37| Teaching to a test is not teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5617)|
| 1:33:42| Not having the autonomy to make decisions which are in the best interest of students is not teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5622)|
| 1:33:50| Not being trusted as a professional educator after going through years of higher education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5630)|
| 1:33:56| and professional development is demeaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| Most of us feel like we have the most important jobs in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| but are treated as if we don't have the intelligence to make decisions about our own classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5644)|
| 1:34:11| where we spend more time than with our own families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| The results of the survey prove that in our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| there is discontent and disapproval with current policies and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5659)|
| 1:34:24| Our goal in speaking out is to make the public aware of the current devastating climate in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5664)|
| 1:34:31| It is time for us to take education back from the hands of the corporate reformers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5671)|
| 1:34:37| whose interest in education is about the dollar, never the student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5677)|
| 1:34:42| Educators know what is best for students, not politicians, not businessmen, or wealthy reformers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5682)|
| 1:34:51| Teachers know how to prepare students for college and professional careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5691)|
| 1:34:57| 163 pages of teachers can't be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5702)|
| 1:35:11| All right, at this time, I think we've asked Fulton and Webb to come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| or come at a certain time and it's that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| So I want to ask the clerk to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5718)|
| 1:35:26| And what we'll need to do is the clerk's going to read the caption for Fulton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| and we'll need a motion to just cut back into our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| A resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee honoring the Fulton High School football team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| Coach Black, I think I saw you guys come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| If you'll come down to the podium there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5745)|
| 1:35:54| All right, we have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5757)|
| 1:35:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| All right, clerk, coach, if everybody that's with you will come down, that would be great if they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| Madam Clerk, if you'll read the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| The Fulton High School football team recently prevailed over Giles County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| in the Blue Cross Bowl for the Class 4A state championship title,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5771)|

| 1:36:36| the team's record ranks fifth in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| And whereas while there were many standouts on the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| the three players were nominated for Tennessee Titans Mr. Football Awards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| and Xavier Hawkins was named the first Mr. Football in Fulton's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| And whereas ten players were also named to the Class 4A all-state team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| by the Tennessee Sportswriters Association, which recognition was a Fulton record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| And whereas Head Coach Rob Black, together with his assistant coaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5820)|

| 1:37:08| And whereas Coach Black was recognized for his leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5828)|

| 1:37:52| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the Public Welfare Requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5872)|
| 1:37:57| Commissioner Rose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| I just wanted to say, as a member of the community in which Fulton is our school, we are so proud of this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5879)|
| 1:38:06| We are so incredibly proud, not just of our amazing football team, but the entire school community is just outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5886)|
| 1:38:13| And it's reflected in our sports programs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5893)|
| 1:38:18| So, my goodness, you're tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| So, what I'm going to do is let Coach Black introduce the people who are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5901)|
| 1:38:26| and if you'd like to say a few words on your season and your experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| we would love to hear anything that you have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| Congratulations to everyone in the Fulton community, and especially to the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| and the coaching staff and the hard work you've put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| We think you're fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5927)|
| 1:38:53| Let me just quickly say I was hoping to be able to bring some of my players with me today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5933)|
| 1:38:58| but they are back at the school in the weight room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| We got out at 4 o'clock today, so I have got them lifting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| and half the coaches are there putting them through their workouts today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| I brought with me a few of my coaches that are on the staff, and I'll introduce those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5948)|
| 1:39:14| Bob Black, who happens to be my dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5954)|
| 1:39:20| Coach Pete Stout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| Jason Harbison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| And my wife, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| My daughter, McKaylee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| And my mom, Brenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| Let me just say what an honor it is to be before you guys of the County Commission today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5977)|
| 1:39:45| You know, I took a special group of guys to Cookville to compete for a state championship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| for the second consecutive year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| and we not only had a great year winning, being 15 and 0 and setting several records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5991)|
| 1:39:57| but I've told so many people the quality kids that we have that represented our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=5997)|
| 1:40:02| and our school is just unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| We've got so many guys who have really gotten it done in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| and made themselves recruitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| And those of you that have read the paper lately have noticed how many of our guys are accepting opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6009)|
| 1:40:15| to move on to higher education and playing football and getting a degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| And I assure you that we have told them how important getting that degree is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6019)|
| 1:40:24| So we've got a lot of different guys that come from homes that maybe no one has ever went to college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6024)|
| 1:40:29| and graduated, and we've talked to them about the importance of being the first person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| in their family to do that and set the standard for the people and the future in their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6033)|
| 1:40:38| So thank you to the County Commission for honoring us today, and we're happy to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6042)|
| 1:40:43| Coach Black, I just want to say, I mean, your dad has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6043)|
| 1:40:50| your family has been investing in our community since before you were born,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6050)|
| 1:40:54| and it's reflected clearly that the whole family has supported that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6054)|
| 1:41:00| and, you know, the camaraderie there, the pride at Fulton is deep and it's strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6060)|
| 1:41:05| You know, in 91 when they closed Holston, they were talking about closing Fulton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| but the people really stood up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| And it's just a reflection of what you guys bring to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| and the character that you've done is just amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| And I appreciate you investing your time in your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| Your family, I mean, has sacrificed tremendously for the last 30 or 40 football seasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6083)|
| 1:41:29| and so we appreciate what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| Forty-nine, so there's a reason the field's named Coach Blackfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6091)|
| 1:41:36| and we appreciate what you've invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6099)|
| 1:41:44| Is the player here, or do you want to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| We can wait a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| Are they on their way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| All right, we'll wait on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| Let's go ahead with some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| Amy wants to put the Fulton band recognition off a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| I need a motion for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6122)|
| 1:42:03| We've got a first and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6125)|
| 1:42:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6126)|
| 1:42:07| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6127)|
| 1:42:08| Okay, band's been moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6128)|
| 1:42:09| Next teacher, we'll go back into that, and when the web football player shows up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| I will stop for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| Just a reminder, five minutes, name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6139)|
| 1:42:22| Okay, I'm Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| I live at 12912 Sycamore Circle, and I'd like to thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6143)|
| 1:42:29| I'm going to speak to some specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| It's my understanding you wanted to hear about some specifics that are causing stress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| and just a lot of really negativity with teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6157)|
| 1:42:43| and I've got a specific example that I'd like to outline for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| And it is confusing, so at any time, if you have a question, please stop me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| But I teach at Fairgate Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| I'm an eighth-grade teacher, but I teach physical science, high school physical science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6175)|
| 1:43:01| So what that means is the top-scoring students in our school on the seventh-grade science TCAP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6181)|
| 1:43:07| that's who I teach, and it's basically like they're skipping eighth-grade science| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| because they've already shown the ability to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| So they take physical science exactly the same as the high school class, same curriculum, same EOC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6194)|
| 1:43:20| same requirements, everything the same across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| They get high school credit for it, and they have a head start on their high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| These kids, like I said, they're the top kids in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| They're scoring hundreds, 99s, and 98s on their seventh-grade science TCAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6211)|
| 1:43:36| So I absolutely love teaching these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| They're motivated, they want to learn, and they are so very capable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| And that's what I have the opportunity to do with these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| However, these are also the kids that are hardest to grow on a TVOS score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6227)|
| 1:43:53| TVOS measures value added, so somebody scoring 100, 99, and 98, there's not a lot of room to grow there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6233)|
| 1:43:59| And we'll come back to that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| But the first year physical science was offered in middle school was four years ago, three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6242)|
| 1:44:07| And I taught, at that point, four physical science classes and one eighth-grade science class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6247)|
| 1:44:13| That eighth-grade science class was an inclusion class with several ESL students, which I love teaching those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6253)|
| 1:44:21| It's great to, you know, be with them in the classroom as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6261)|
| 1:44:25| But what Knox County did that year, they had the physical science kids, rightly so, not take the TCAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6265)|
| 1:44:33| That TCAP is over the eighth-grade curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| So those students, they decided, well, this doesn't make sense to have them taking a TCAP over a curriculum that they're not even taught,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6276)|
| 1:44:43| which obviously, again, is the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| So that first year, those students did not take the TCAPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| Well, what that left me with was 22 out of 150 students TVOS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6288)|
| 1:44:55| So in other words, 130 of my students were completely disregarded as far as team goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| and my 35 percent growth score came solely from those 22 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| So obviously, you know, there's a huge inequality there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| That resulted in my TVOS score being a one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| At that time, I posed some questions to William Sanders, the inventor of TVOS, the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| the person who put TVOS together and put it in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| And I asked him, I said, I explained my situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| I said, in this situation, is this data accurate and complete for the evaluation of a teacher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6321)|
| 1:45:28| Dr. Sanders' response, and I quote, was for an evaluation of the effectiveness of the teacher to facilitate student academic progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6328)|
| 1:45:37| Of course not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6337)|
| 1:45:38| I also asked him, does this situation reflect an accurate use of TVOS data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6338)|
| 1:45:43| Does this situation constitute the intended use of TVOS data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| And again, I'm quoting, for the tested students, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| To attempt to use this one class as a measure of teacher effectiveness, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| So here we have the creator of TVOS saying that TVOS is not being used fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6355)|
| 1:46:02| It's not being used correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| And Knox County was aware of this three years ago because I filed a grievance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6363)|
| 1:46:08| at which point Knox County didn't follow their grievance policy, but that's another issue altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6368)|
| 1:46:15| The result of that meeting was Dr. McIntyre suggested to me that I lobby to the state to have another test for those students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6375)|
| 1:46:22| which, I mean, I cringe when I think of me ever lobbying for more tests for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6382)|
| 1:46:28| So what this did to school scores, you take the top 130 kids out of the science scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6388)|
| 1:46:36| out of that science year for TVOS, TCAPS, the scores dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| It made the school look bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| It made our school look really bad when you take those top kids out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| It made the county scores drop, which, of course, is expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6404)|
| 1:46:49| So the next year, at the end of that year, the central office posed the question to the principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6409)|
| 1:46:56| do we want these kids to take the TCAP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| And, of course, their answer, after seeing what happened at my school, was yes, we need these kids to take the TCAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6419)|
| 1:47:05| So now I'm in a position where I teach only physical science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| Again, it's a completely different curriculum than the eighth grade TCAP curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| It's not the same curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| These kids now are taking the TCAP, and they're still doing well on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| They're still scoring advanced, but they're no longer scoring 100s, 98s, and 99s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| Now they're scoring 99s, 98s, and 97s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| So they're still scoring the top of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| In fact, our school for eighth grade science is the highest achieving school in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6452)|
| 1:47:40| But those kids have now dropped a grade or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6460)|
| 1:47:45| So, again, for the school it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| They're still scoring advanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| It still is good for the school, good for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| But for me, that's negative gains on those kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| So now I'm in my second year, this will be my third year, of scoring a one on TVOS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6475)|
| 1:48:01| because my kids are being tested over a curriculum that they're not enrolled in and that they're not taught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6481)|
| 1:48:06| And I'm suffering for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| I've received two conference of concern letters that explicitly states termination is a real possibility if this doesn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6488)|
| 1:48:16| And it's not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6496)|
| 1:48:17| I still teach physical science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| That's all I teach now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| No TCAP classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| And these kids are still taking that TCAP over a curriculum that they're not taught or they're not even enrolled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6502)|
| 1:48:28| And the school looks great for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| The county looks great for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| Yet I'm sitting here about to lose my job, or at least being threatened to lose my job over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6511)|
| 1:48:36| In addition, I've missed out on two years of bonus money strictly because of that one on my TVOS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6516)|
| 1:48:42| And obviously I'm not doing this for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| But the reality is I've lost money because of the way Knox County is using this TVOS data in a way that the creator of it has said is unfair initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6524)|
| 1:48:55| And now because my kids are scoring advanced but not growing on a curriculum, on a test over a curriculum, that they're not even taught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6535)|
| 1:49:05| Mr. Taylor, the five minutes is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| Can you wrap up, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| Yes, I'll wrap it up real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| So I don't say this to make myself feel good, but I've had parents, students, administrators, high school teachers that have gotten my kids all commend me for my teaching over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6549)|
| 1:49:23| In fact, our coach, we got a new principal this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| That principal brought his instructional coach with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| That instructional coach knew that I was a point of concern because of that TVOS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| At the beginning of the year, she was in my room one day to see what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| At the end of that lesson, she said, I don't need to come back to your room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| You got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| There's nothing I need to improve on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| You're doing exactly what you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| You understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| But now this year, this year I'm what's called an outlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| The evaluators now have pressure on them to have their evaluators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| I forgot to mention my observation scores for the past two years have averaged a 4.2 out of 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6594)|
| 1:50:00| So the evaluators now consider me what's called an outlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6600)|
| 1:50:05| And what that means, an outlier is a teacher whose observation scores are greater than two points away from their TVOS score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6605)|
| 1:50:15| So my observation scores are a 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| My TVOS is a 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| So now I'm an outlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| Principals are pressured to not have outliers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| So can you imagine what my observation scores are going to be this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6624)|
| 1:50:28| Anything but a 3, and those principals have to go through remedial training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| So regardless of what kind of teaching I'm doing, if they give me anything higher than a 3, then they're going to have repercussions for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6632)|
| 1:50:40| Here's the worst thing in all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| I've had teachers and coaches or principals and coaches tell me to my face, quoted, you need to put yourself ahead of your students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6642)|
| 1:50:52| You need to do what's best for you at the cost of your students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6652)|
| 1:51:01| Coaches and principals telling me that in a classroom, not even realizing what a terrible thing as an educator that is to say or hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6661)|
| 1:51:08| that I need to put myself ahead of my students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| And I understand why they're saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| They're saying that, I'm just about done, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| You'll have to finish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6676)|
| 1:51:17| Ten seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6677)|
| 1:51:18| And it's because they want me to be able to continue teaching, and they have told me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| They want me to continue teaching, and the only way they see that happening is if I put myself above my students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6682)|
| 1:51:28| You know, I'm not a teacher for my students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| And as soon as I think that I'm more important than my students in my classroom, then I don't belong in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6690)|
| 1:51:37| Thank you, and I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6697)|
| 1:51:38| That's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6698)|
| 1:51:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| Briefly, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| Mr. Taylor, I do not see how the administration, with you having your lowest score being a 96 or 97 and you scoring a one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6704)|
| 1:51:51| I do not see how they say you're about to lose your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| Something is not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| Yes, I agree completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6716)|
| 1:52:04| I'm not saying the lowest score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| I'm just saying on average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6726)|
| 1:52:07| I mean, those kids are doing great on the TCAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| Most of them are making it in those 90 to 100 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| There's some, you know, low 90s, low 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| But the real measure should be the EOC my kids take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| My kids take the high school EOC, and they do great on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| The average has been for the past three years, I think, a 92 or a 93 of my kids on the high school EOC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6742)|
| 1:52:29| So they're learning the material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| They're excelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| They're doing great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6752)|
| 1:52:33| They're even doing great on the TCAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| But TVOS doesn't care what they score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6756)|
| 1:52:40| It just cares whether you grow them or don't grow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6760)|
| 1:52:43| If they improve, then you have positive growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| If they drop, then it's negative growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| I don't see how with a straight face they can tell you're about to lose your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6769)|
| 1:52:53| I agree completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| But I have two letters to show it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6776)|
| 1:52:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| What we're going to do now, it's 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6779)|
| 1:53:02| And I hate to break all this up, but we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| The coach and player from way over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| Please come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6787)|
| 1:53:08| And, Madam Clerk, if you'll read the Webb High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6788)|
| 1:53:14| Resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee honoring the Webb School of Knoxville football team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6794)|
| 1:53:20| Whereas the Webb School of Knoxville football team recently prevailed over St. George's to win the coveted Division II,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6800)|
| 1:53:25| a state championship title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| And whereas the 28-14 victory earned the Webb School its seventh state championship title in football,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6807)|
| 1:53:33| four of which have been in the last five seasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| And whereas the eight senior players on the team this year have been a part of three state championship game victories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6816)|
| 1:53:42| in their four years on the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6822)|

| 1:53:50| and a cumulative four-year record of 44-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| Whereas Head Coach David Massey, together with his assistant coaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| provided the leadership and direction for the team's successful season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6837)|
| 1:54:01| And whereas the Knox County Commission desires to congratulate all team members for their outstanding effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6841)|
| 1:54:06| and performance this season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6846)|
| 1:54:08| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| The Commission of Knox County hereby honors and recognizes the Webb School of Knoxville football team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6852)|

| 1:54:39| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6879)|
| 1:54:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6880)|
| 1:54:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6882)|
| 1:54:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6883)|
| 1:54:44| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| I mean, I have the privilege of having several private schools in my district as well as public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6886)|
| 1:54:52| And so this is a school that has had a history of providing championships on several athletic venues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6892)|
| 1:55:01| and also in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6901)|
| 1:55:02| And so, Coach, thank you for coming out and appreciate the hard work you guys have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6902)|
| 1:55:07| If you want to say a word and introduce your player, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6907)|
| 1:55:12| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6912)|
| 1:55:13| We appreciate this honor and thank the county commission very much for this honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6913)|
| 1:55:19| My name is Kevin Catlett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6919)|
| 1:55:20| This is Carter Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| He represents our senior class, one of the eight that was mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6922)|
| 1:55:26| He had a unique – you mind if I –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6928)|
| 1:55:29| Or you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| Carter broke his arm severely in the jamboree, and he was a stellar player.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6932)|
| 1:55:37| I'll state, before, was not able to play this whole season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6937)|
| 1:55:42| But just to show the leadership that we have from the senior class and from Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6942)|
| 1:55:47| he was with us and provided leadership throughout the whole year and had a great senior class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6947)|
| 1:55:53| I hate to see him go, but thanks again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6957)|
| 1:56:18| All right, now we're going to take a break from the commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6978)|
| 1:56:24| to go into what may be a fairly short zoning meeting, we hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6984)|
| 1:56:30| So, yeah, we'll need a roll call for the zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6990)|
| 1:56:35| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=6995)|

| 1:57:28| Is there any opposition here to the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7048)|

| 1:58:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7080)|
| 1:58:01| Would you make an announcement to the teachers what you're doing right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| What we're doing now is we have three or four items on zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| We'll go through these three or four items, and then we'll come back to the discussion that we were just having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7090)|
| 1:58:16| I apologize if I didn't make that clear earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| 12-A-13-SP requested Mark Abelick, PE, for a northwest county sector plan amendment from AGRR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7102)|
| 1:58:31| Agricultural Rural Residential STPA Stream Protection Area and SLPA Slope Protection Area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7111)|
| 1:58:38| to LDR, Low Density Residential STPA Stream Protection Area and SLPA Slope Protection Area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7118)|
| 1:58:45| property located north and south sides Everett Road, northwest and southeast sides Yarnell Road, Commission District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7125)|
| 1:58:54| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7136)|
| 1:58:57| For MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7137)|
| 1:58:58| For MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7138)|
| 1:58:59| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7144)|
| 1:59:10| I'm here with Mark Abelick, who filed the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7153)|
| 1:59:14| And Opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| Manuel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7158)|
| 1:59:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| Manuel Letacek, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7164)|
| 1:59:25| And do you want to go first, Arthur, or do you want to listen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7165)|
| 1:59:28| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7168)|
| 1:59:29| If I may, I'd like to go first briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| You've got your name and address and you've got five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7175)|
| 1:59:41| As I mentioned, I'm here with Mark Bilek, the engineer on the project, to file the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7181)|
| 1:59:48| This is a farm at the intersection of Yarnell Road and Everett Road, which consists of about 94 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7188)|
| 1:59:57| The family no longer lives here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| The farm is going to be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| If you exit at Watt Road and get on Everett Road and go about a mile east, you will travel by a number of truck terminals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7203)|
| 2:00:15| truck sales areas, truck-related businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7215)|
| 2:00:20| Then you get to a mulch facility, which has been there for a number of years, mulch sales facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7220)|
| 2:00:27| and I think it operates as a mulch business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| Then you come to where Everett Road intersects with Yarnell Road, and you have the Hauser Farm, which is about 94 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7231)|
| 2:00:41| The property is presently zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7241)|
| 2:00:45| The sector plan is rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7245)|
| 2:00:49| We are asking that the property or the sector plan be amended to low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7249)|
| 2:00:57| MPC agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| We are asking that the property be zoned planned residential at up to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7259)|
| 2:01:06| And looking at the location of the property, it is immediately adjacent to I-40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7266)|
| 2:01:13| excuse me, between Campbell Station Road and Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7273)|
| 2:01:17| It's just immediately to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| It is north of the town of Farragut, where there are numerous suburbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7279)|
| 2:01:23| The property has a stream on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7283)|
| 2:01:27| The property has some slope on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7287)|
| 2:01:31| As MPC has noted in their report, before anything can be done with the property, the stream will have to be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7291)|
| 2:01:40| The slope areas will have to be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| The stream area will be even taken out of the property for consideration of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7302)|
| 2:01:49| We will also be required to set aside property for a greenway not only on the north side of the property along the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7309)|
| 2:01:59| but on the south side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| Right now, under the agricultural zoning, none of those restrictions apply to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7321)|
| 2:02:08| What we're asking for is a planned zone that will allow the buyers of this property to develop it in an orderly manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7328)|
| 2:02:19| in accordance with the requirements of the MPC, the requirements of TDAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7339)|
| 2:02:25| the requirements of the other agencies that will regulate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7345)|
| 2:02:30| There was a question raised about the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| Based upon the ultimate density of this property, we will have to prepare and submit to MPC a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7354)|
| 2:02:42| I anticipate that that traffic study will include improvements at the intersection of Yarnell Road and Everett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7362)|
| 2:02:51| The developer will fund those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| We are not asking Knox County for anything other than permission to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7373)|
| 2:02:59| I anticipate the development will have walking trails, amenities, and other things as it is built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7379)|
| 2:03:07| So we think this will be a good location for a residential community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7387)|
| 2:03:13| It will also stop the commercial that is coming east on Everett Road from the interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7393)|
| 2:03:21| and will be a good place for a residential community at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7401)|
| 2:03:26| I'd like to reserve the balance of my time, if I may, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| I have a question for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7410)|
| 2:03:32| On the LDR, he's wanting to do the second plan to LDR, but he's wanting planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7412)|
| 2:03:42| Are there differences in those two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| I mean, do we gain more control, one versus the other, as far as design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7424)|
| 2:03:50| By asking for planned residential, you have additional ability to have input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7430)|
| 2:03:56| or at least MPC will, on the design of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| So it gives us a little bit extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| Give it another layer of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| Right, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| And the LDR allows consideration of any plan, if you approve the density of five, up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7444)|
| 2:04:12| Minus the creek bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| Whatever adjustments you have to make there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7454)|
| 2:04:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7456)|
| 2:04:18| Ms. Tasik, I'm sorry, don't let me get it wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7458)|
| 2:04:20| but I just need your name and address for the record and you'll have five minutes also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7460)|
| 2:04:24| My name is Manuela Tasik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| I live at 12320 Pitman Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| I'm on just the north side of this great amount of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7470)|
| 2:04:35| which had been owned by a farmer who took very good care of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7475)|
| 2:04:40| We live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7480)|
| 2:04:42| I'm not a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7482)|
| 2:04:43| I'm not a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7483)|
| 2:04:45| Unfortunately, the majority of my neighbors either had jobs that they had to attend to this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7485)|
| 2:04:51| and this evening, child care, or we would be coming in with about 25 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7491)|
| 2:04:56| We are that upset about this growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| We feel the MPC had rubber-stamped an approval and never even listened to what we had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7499)|
| 2:05:06| We all live there one house per acre at the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7506)|
| 2:05:12| I'm at one acre, one and a half acres to one house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7512)|
| 2:05:16| Many people are to five acres per house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| Are we not tired of urban sprawl?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7520)|
| 2:05:24| This is at the far edge of Knox County, and I think it's about time we say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7524)|
| 2:05:31| Unfortunately, the majority of our neighbors also feel like you can't fight city hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7531)|
| 2:05:37| That's why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| I would like you to consider only two houses to an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7539)|
| 2:05:43| We're all on septic tanks out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7543)|
| 2:05:46| There's no sewer right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7546)|
| 2:05:48| They're going to have to run a lot of other infrastructure amenities that are necessary there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7548)|
| 2:05:55| It is a very small, quiet area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7555)|
| 2:05:58| I do not believe that it will be able to handle the amount of traffic that will come from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7558)|
| 2:06:07| Several years ago, there was some land at Pitman and Graybeal that, I can't remember the actual acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7567)|
| 2:06:17| I think it was 77 acres, and we had to fight that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7577)|
| 2:06:21| He ended up being able to be given two and three-quarters houses per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7581)|
| 2:06:27| and then that all changed and a great deal of the land was sold because he kind of went bankrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7587)|
| 2:06:33| I'm tired of rubber-stamping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7593)|
| 2:06:36| Our neighbors are tired of rubber-stamping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7596)|
| 2:06:38| and we are asking you, the commission, to finally come out and see this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7598)|
| 2:06:45| It's not just a truck stop area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7605)|
| 2:06:47| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7607)|
| 2:06:48| It's our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7608)|
| 2:06:49| We live there, and I'd like to reserve my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7609)|
| 2:06:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7612)|
| 2:06:57| Does anybody have any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7617)|
| 2:07:01| MPC, Buzz, how many folks showed up in opposition or how many folks emailed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| I was trying to pull up the packet and I can't grab a hold of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7626)|
| 2:07:18| Mr. Chair, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7638)|
| 2:07:20| I don't recall an exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7640)|
| 2:07:22| I don't think there were many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| I can stand to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7644)|
| 2:07:26| The record does indicate that two people did speak in, I believe, in opposition to the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7646)|
| 2:07:34| But I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7654)|
| 2:07:35| I can stand to be corrected in terms of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7655)|
| 2:07:37| But I don't recall a lot of people showing up at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7657)|
| 2:07:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7662)|
| 2:07:45| And what was the vote on MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| Thirteen to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7668)|
| 2:07:53| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| Arthur, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| I apologize to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| I thought we talked to everybody that had joined the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7681)|
| 2:08:04| and lived within several blocks of the property and explained the plan to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7684)|
| 2:08:10| I don't think you live, if I may, do you live adjacent to this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7690)|
| 2:08:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7696)|
| 2:08:17| We tried to talk to everybody in the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| At Planning Commission, there were two people that spoke in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7699)|
| 2:08:24| and as I recall, those were the only two people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7704)|
| 2:08:31| We had made a very big effort to get in touch with anybody in the area, one-on-one, just going door-to-door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7711)|
| 2:08:39| Mr. Bialik and other people in his organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7719)|
| 2:08:46| So I apologize that we did not get to talk to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7726)|
| 2:08:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7732)|
| 2:08:53| Do you have anything else, Arthur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7735)|
| 2:08:56| I would just point out that I think we can get a more unified, better development this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7736)|
| 2:09:01| cluster property, protect the slopes, protect the stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| and provide greenway access to the area for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7745)|
| 2:09:11| and actually the town of Farragut is asking for greenway access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7751)|
| 2:09:16| Ms. Tasik, do you have anything else you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7756)|
| 2:09:22| I was one of those that was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7762)|
| 2:09:24| And there was a lawyer neighbor that was here at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7764)|
| 2:09:29| and I find it interesting that I, when I called and made the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7769)|
| 2:09:33| was told that no one else had shown any interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| And yet this gentleman, I can't remember his name right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7777)|
| 2:09:40| the lawyer who came, the neighbor, he too was told that no one was interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7780)|
| 2:09:47| I do know that neighbors did send emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| And as far as I know, not any real neighbors in have heard anything about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7789)|
| 2:09:59| And it's very frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| This area, I would recommend that you go take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| It's a beautiful deer sanctuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7804)|
| 2:10:07| The animals out there are beautiful, the ducks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7807)|
| 2:10:10| Are we just going to overrun our whole county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7810)|
| 2:10:15| I would hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| And I would really hope that this doesn't get rubber-stamped also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7824)|
| 2:10:25| I received some correspondence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| but it dealt more along the lines of overall development in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7827)|
| 2:10:32| and overall school issues about capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7832)|
| 2:10:35| and not per se in opposition to this particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7835)|
| 2:10:39| So I'll make a motion that we approve this sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7839)|
| 2:10:45| Do we already have a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=7845)|

| 2:14:06| Just a reminder, five minutes and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8046)|
| 2:14:09| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8049)|
| 2:14:10| Jennifer Nagel, 6208 Bryan Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8050)|
| 2:14:13| My name is Jennifer Nagel, and I'm speaking as a parent, not as PTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8053)|
| 2:14:16| I have three children in public school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8056)|
| 2:14:18| I would like to talk to you about the excessive amount of testing that they go through every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8058)|
| 2:14:22| My second-grade daughter takes 17 standardized tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8062)|
| 2:14:26| Seventeen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| This is pretty excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8068)|
| 2:14:29| They include CBMs, discovery ed, care, writing assessments, math assessments, CRA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8069)|
| 2:14:34| which, by the way, the name has been changed since too many parents were refusing this test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8074)|
| 2:14:39| Now it is part of the curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| And teachers are told to call it a task so parents no longer question it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8081)|
| 2:14:45| And lastly, the SAT-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| After talking with many teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| I have been told that only one of those actually help teachers with assessing students' growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| Then I have to ask, why do we put our children through so many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8093)|
| 2:14:57| How much valuable instructional time is being taken away because we test our children so much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8097)|
| 2:15:02| I would like to take a minute to discuss the SAT-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8102)|
| 2:15:05| SAT-10, or K-2 assessment, is an ACT-style bubble test for 5- to 8-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8105)|
| 2:15:11| Many don't have the hand-eye coordination to fill in the bubble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8111)|
| 2:15:14| and they get stressed when a different teacher has to come in their classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| It is optional by county, according to the Tennessee Department of Education website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8118)|
| 2:15:22| Our children are not developmentally ready to take this test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8122)|
| 2:15:26| And our state agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8126)|
| 2:15:28| Tennessee State Law 49-6-6002 states tests are not to be conducted earlier than grade 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8128)|
| 2:15:35| I have told my daughter's teacher that I will refuse this test this spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8135)|
| 2:15:38| only to be told I am not allowed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8138)|
| 2:15:41| I have been told that I need to keep my healthy daughter home from school the days of testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8141)|
| 2:15:45| which I believe would be four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| But we must also include the makeup days the following week, so that's another four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8148)|
| 2:15:53| That is eight days that Knox County Schools is telling me I need to keep my healthy daughter home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8153)|
| 2:15:58| Let me repeat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8158)|
| 2:16:00| Eight days the district is telling me to keep my daughter home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8160)|
| 2:16:03| just so she doesn't take a test that will do nothing for her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8163)|
| 2:16:07| but will count 35% on her teacher's evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| If this is optional by county, why am I not allowed to refuse it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| Every Thursday night and Friday morning, my daughter gets very anxious about school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8174)|
| 2:16:18| Fridays are test day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8178)|
| 2:16:20| I have no issues with these weekly tests she has to take, which include spelling or math tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8180)|
| 2:16:24| But all my daughter hears is another test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8184)|
| 2:16:27| She now gets anxious over all tests, even the ones that are helpful and not detrimental to her learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8187)|
| 2:16:33| because of the excessive standardized tests that are being forced upon our very young children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8193)|
| 2:16:37| What are we doing to our children when even something as simple as a hearing test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8197)|
| 2:16:41| makes children anxious because of the word test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8201)|
| 2:16:44| My daughter now goes into school already anxious about every single test she has to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8204)|
| 2:16:48| How well do you think she does on these standardized tests?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8208)|
| 2:16:52| She does horribly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| Last year she scored below average on the SAT-10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| but her report card says she is an average student doing well in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8216)|
| 2:17:00| This year, this test counts as 35% of her teacher's evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8220)|
| 2:17:04| This is very disturbing to me because my daughter has an excellent teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8224)|
| 2:17:08| who has helped my daughter grow leaps and bounds, but this SAT-10 test won't show that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8228)|
| 2:17:12| My daughter hates school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8232)|
| 2:17:14| She is in second grade, and she already hates school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8234)|
| 2:17:18| There are many elementary students across Knox County that hate school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8238)|
| 2:17:22| Parents are hearing, Mom, I can't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8242)|
| 2:17:24| I'm too stupid to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8244)|
| 2:17:26| I feel like my heart will explode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| And our administration doesn't see this as a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8249)|
| 2:17:32| This is a time when we should be fostering a love of learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8252)|
| 2:17:35| not teaching them how to fill in bubbles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8255)|
| 2:17:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8258)|
| 2:17:46| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8266)|
| 2:17:49| Next on the list, Sherry Morgan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8269)|
| 2:17:54| Sherry Morgan, 1712 Penwood, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8274)|
| 2:17:58| Thank you for giving us this historic opportunity to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8278)|
| 2:18:01| and thank you for recognizing that we are more than a pocket of dissatisfaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8281)|
| 2:18:05| as some people would have you and the citizens of Knox County believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8285)|
| 2:18:09| People have called this a teacher revolt and have called us disgruntled and naysayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8289)|
| 2:18:13| Well, I call this a movement for teachers to reclaim their profession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8293)|
| 2:18:17| and do what is best for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| I'm going to give you some history of how we got to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8299)|
| 2:18:22| It started in Wisconsin in 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| and I had no idea Tennessee would be the next state attacking public schools and teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8304)|
| 2:18:29| In 2011, Tennessee teachers saw their bargaining rights replaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8309)|
| 2:18:32| by the Professional Educators Collaborative Conferencing Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8312)|
| 2:18:36| and tenure, which was created to ensure due process for educators, was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8316)|
| 2:18:41| State board policies, suggesting the retraction of teachers' licenses based on student test scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8321)|
| 2:18:46| was on the horizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| Time of performance of students on state tests to the salaries of teachers became a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8328)|
| 2:18:53| A new evaluation system called TEAM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8333)|
| 2:18:56| which evaluates teachers based on a rubric that is impossible to master with every lesson began in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8336)|
| 2:19:02| Teachers began evaluating teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8342)|
| 2:19:04| Many of these teachers were charged with making judgments about the instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8344)|
| 2:19:08| and content knowledge of fellow teachers who teach a subject the evaluators have little or no knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8348)|
| 2:19:14| Let me state, teachers do not mind yearly evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8354)|
| 2:19:18| We just want to make sure they are fair and equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8358)|
| 2:19:21| And all of this was in the name of education reform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| Is it really education reform or a way for corporations to take over public schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8363)|
| 2:19:29| In 2009, Common Core standards were developed and then released in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8369)|
| 2:19:34| Within a few months, Common Core was endorsed by 45 states and the District of Columbia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8374)|
| 2:19:40| Publishers and technology companies started aligning materials, curriculum, and software with Common Core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8380)|
| 2:19:46| Two federally funded groups have created online tests for Common Core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8386)|
| 2:19:50| We have discovered these testing companies report directly to the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8390)|
| 2:19:54| with not only student test scores but also demographical information that most would deem as private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8394)|
| 2:20:01| These tests are expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8401)|
| 2:20:03| They require technology that we do not have and cannot maintain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8403)|
| 2:20:06| and most importantly, are not developmentally appropriate for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8406)|
| 2:20:11| The required amount of testing is overwhelming our youngest students, their parents, and our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8411)|
| 2:20:16| and serve to do nothing but waste valuable instruction time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8416)|
| 2:20:19| Make no mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| Common Core will affect the Knox County Schools budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8421)|
| 2:20:24| And all this happened at a time that coincides as public schools are under attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8424)|
| 2:20:29| Common Core standards were written in 2009 with the help from the National Governors Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8429)|
| 2:20:34| the Council of Chief State School Officers, and Achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8434)|
| 2:20:38| It was developed behind closed doors with 27 people and few educators writing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8438)|
| 2:20:44| However, testing companies were very involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8444)|
| 2:20:47| There have been no field tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| And who funded it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8449)|
| 2:20:50| The Gates Foundation has spent nearly $200 million on this endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8450)|
| 2:20:55| And what does Mr. Bill Gates stand to gain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| Where will the technology come from to implement these tests?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8457)|
| 2:21:01| Maybe Bill Gates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8461)|
| 2:21:02| Many states have now pulled out of Common Core, and I believe only a few states are still involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8462)|
| 2:21:07| And there is no evidence that Common Core will work better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8467)|
| 2:21:10| will better prepare our children for college and the workplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8470)|
| 2:21:14| Bush's No Child Left Behind, or as teachers have called it, No Teacher Left Standing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8474)|
| 2:21:19| and Obama's Race to the Top, or as I like to call it, The Dash for the Cash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8479)|
| 2:21:23| have combined to impose a punitive regimen of standardized testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| NCLB was passed in 2001 and signed this law in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8487)|
| 2:21:32| And this law required schools to test every child in grades three through eight every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8492)|
| 2:21:37| In 2004, this year, every child must be proficient according to the Common Core standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8497)|
| 2:21:42| or their school will face sanctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8502)|
| 2:21:44| What are those sanctions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8504)|
| 2:21:45| Firing the entire staff and closing schools is one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8505)|
| 2:21:49| And this happened a year early in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| with Sarah Moore Greene and Von Mittal being reconstituted with new leadership and staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8511)|
| 2:21:56| Such measures are damaging for communities and the morale of teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8516)|
| 2:22:00| Could it be the plan all along to replace teachers with advanced degrees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8520)|
| 2:22:03| and years of experience with Teach for America?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8523)|
| 2:22:06| After all, the value and experience in continued education has been abolished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8526)|
| 2:22:10| with the removal of years teaching in degrees earned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| as an incentive to earn more money in the field of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8533)|
| 2:22:16| How can anyone support replacing teachers with a master's degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8536)|
| 2:22:19| and 30-plus years of experience in teaching with so-called educators from the business world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8539)|
| 2:22:24| who have only six weeks of teacher training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8544)|
| 2:22:27| Are those the teachers any of us would prefer for our own children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8547)|
| 2:22:32| NCLB encouraged teachers to teach to the test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8552)|
| 2:22:35| Schools were forced to focus on reading, math, history, civics, literature, geography, science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8555)|
| 2:22:39| and the arts and physical education were left unfunded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| And I'm sure you have all heard about the test-related cheating scandals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| in Atlanta, El Paso, and the District of Columbia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8565)|
| 2:22:48| Did it happen in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| Then came Race to the Top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8570)|
| 2:22:51| Congress gave the Department of Ed $5 billion to promote the reform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8571)|
| 2:22:55| States had agreed to the terms set by the federal government to receive the extra funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8575)|
| 2:22:59| and now look where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8579)|
| 2:23:01| The terms led to teachers being evaluated according to students' test scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8581)|
| 2:23:04| and many times, including students, they did not even know or have in class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8584)|
| 2:23:08| Privately managed charter schools were to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8588)|
| 2:23:10| College and career-ready standards had to be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8590)|
| 2:23:14| Low-performing schools had the principal and staff fired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8594)|
| 2:23:16| and personal information about every student could be collected and stored in a data warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8596)|
| 2:23:21| By accepting these terms, we have created a system that is damaging to the education of our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8601)|
| 2:23:26| and the livelihood of our teachers who poured their hearts and souls into teaching the whole child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8606)|
| 2:23:30| and meeting the emotional and social needs of every child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8610)|
| 2:23:32| And Tennessee agreed these terms under Governor Bredesen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8612)|
| 2:23:35| and it has been implemented by Governor Haslam with Commissioner Huffman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8615)|
| 2:23:38| a Teach for America alum, making more changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8618)|
| 2:23:41| They're all a part of Race to the Top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| Ms. Morgan, if you'll go ahead and wrap it up there, your time has expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8623)|
| 2:23:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8625)|
| 2:23:47| That's hard to do, but I'll skip over a lot of the slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8627)|
| 2:23:52| As you see, No Child Left Behind, Race to the Top has relied on standardized testing a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8632)|
| 2:23:56| We do not need Teach for America in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8636)|
| 2:23:59| and I don't think they are right now because these people go through a six-week program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8639)|
| 2:24:02| and then teach for two years in a high-needs school, then leave, and then go on to a more lucrative career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8642)|
| 2:24:08| Public education has become a market for testing corporations, charter schools, and online schools and vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8648)|
| 2:24:13| Corporations are making money off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8653)|
| 2:24:16| No other nation in this world has inflicted so many changes and mandates on teachers in public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8656)|
| 2:24:20| No other nation tests every student every year like we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8660)|
| 2:24:23| No other nation judges the quality of teachers by the test scores of their students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8663)|
| 2:24:27| Teachers must have the flexibility to tailor their standards to meet the needs of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8667)|
| 2:24:31| We must be able to teach what we see is the best way to teach our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8671)|
| 2:24:34| and make decisions for our lessons based on our student needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8674)|
| 2:24:37| We must do what is right for our students, and I want to be very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8677)|
| 2:24:41| Teachers will not compromise our high standards and rigorous expectations for our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8681)|
| 2:24:46| but let's not compromise public education to line the pockets of the corporate world either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8686)|
| 2:24:50| Thank you, Ms. Quinn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8690)|
| 2:24:56| Ms. Amy Kate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| Amy Kate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8699)|
| 2:25:00| Oh, I'm sorry, I had to get up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8700)|
| 2:25:08| My name is Amy Cross-Kate, and I live at 3321 Lighted Path Lane, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8708)|
| 2:25:16| I want to thank the commission for inviting us to come to speak to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8716)|
| 2:25:20| This is something that is very important to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8720)|
| 2:25:23| We want to maintain public education as it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8723)|
| 2:25:28| We do not want corporate reformers taking it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8728)|
| 2:25:32| I am a lifelong Knoxvillian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| As a result, I attended Knox County, Knoxville City Schools my entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8735)|
| 2:25:41| Additionally, I've been a teacher in the system for approximately 21 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8741)|
| 2:25:47| and I have two children who have gone through Knox County Schools for 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8747)|
| 2:25:52| In summation, I have approximately 40 years' experience in this county as a student, teacher, and a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8752)|
| 2:25:59| Therefore, I have witnessed a lot of growth and change in the system over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8759)|
| 2:26:05| but I have never, ever seen the morale of teachers as low and the demands of teachers so high as they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8765)|
| 2:26:16| My career background is primarily teaching, but I also spent 16 years in the private sector, primarily in sales and management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8776)|
| 2:26:27| Some of the wonderful knowledge that I gained from being around several successful business people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8787)|
| 2:26:33| includes the knowledge of top-down management, also known as micromanagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8793)|
| 2:26:39| Micromanagement is the absolute worst form of managing people because it extremely stifles the creativity of a human being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8799)|
| 2:26:50| We in Knox County are being micromanaged and having a lot of top-down management put upon us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8810)|
| 2:26:58| Teachers are honest, they're caring, they're organized, they're trustworthy, and they're dependable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8818)|
| 2:27:04| I learned that especially became true to me when I was in corporate America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8824)|
| 2:27:09| In 2007, after a 16-year hiatus from teaching, I happily returned to teaching in the district that had educated me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8829)|
| 2:27:19| had given me my first job, and had educated my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8839)|
| 2:27:23| I ran into four of my former students within two months' time that I had at Whittles Springs in the 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8843)|
| 2:27:30| They hugged me and told me what a positive impact I had had on their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8850)|
| 2:27:35| They were happy to see me, and I was so very happy to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8855)|
| 2:27:39| They did not tell me that they were happy that I did not give them a standardized test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8859)|
| 2:27:45| They told me thank you for everything that I had done for them and that I had had a great impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8865)|
| 2:27:53| It is my understanding that County Commission desires more information as to why principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8873)|
| 2:27:58| and teachers and students are stressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8878)|
| 2:28:01| It is plain and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| We have had more put on our plates than a human being can possibly handle day after day, week after week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8883)|
| 2:28:10| 36 weeks out of the year, along with several weeks out of the summer attending professional growth conferences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8890)|
| 2:28:16| Our days are 10 to 12 hours a day, five days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8896)|
| 2:28:21| Many of us put hours in on the weekend, and I do that every weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8901)|
| 2:28:27| Keep in mind not one teacher has asked the Board of Education or County Commission for more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8907)|
| 2:28:34| We just want more autonomy to do our jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8914)|
| 2:28:38| We want the micromanaging to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8918)|
| 2:28:41| We want teachers are not billable hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8921)|
| 2:28:44| They need personal time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8924)|
| 2:28:46| We want fair and equitable evaluations that are realistic, positive, and not overwhelmingly negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8926)|
| 2:28:55| We want the fear to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8935)|
| 2:28:58| We are always in fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8938)|
| 2:29:00| Who is looking at us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| Who is watching us over our shoulder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8942)|
| 2:29:04| When is our next unannounced evaluation going to walk in the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8944)|
| 2:29:10| As teachers, we will do whatever it takes for our students to learn the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8950)|
| 2:29:14| Teachers do not shirk their duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8954)|
| 2:29:16| As I say, we live in fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8956)|
| 2:29:18| This is a story that is a friend of mine who is a teacher in Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8958)|
| 2:29:23| Her husband became very ill last spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8963)|
| 2:29:26| He was diagnosed with cancer and passed away within four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8966)|
| 2:29:31| When I contacted her during this time at UT Medical Center, she was in the ICU lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8971)|
| 2:29:38| I asked her, what are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8978)|
| 2:29:40| I'm doing lesson plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8980)|
| 2:29:42| Why are you doing lesson plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8982)|
| 2:29:44| She says, I have to do them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8984)|
| 2:29:46| Her husband died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8986)|
| 2:29:48| I went to the funeral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8988)|
| 2:29:50| I called to check on her that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| What was she doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8992)|
| 2:29:54| She was doing lesson plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8994)|
| 2:29:56| Why was she doing lesson plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8996)|
| 2:29:58| In fear of what her administrative staff may say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=8998)|
| 2:30:02| Knox County surveyed the teachers in December to gauge the teachers' opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9002)|
| 2:30:07| because it was thought that the dissatisfaction amongst teachers was just a few disgruntled teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9007)|
| 2:30:14| However, the survey proved there are many disgruntled and overworked teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9014)|
| 2:30:20| According to the comments provided on the surveys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9020)|
| 2:30:23| comments were made for much change regarding the entire evaluation process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9023)|
| 2:30:29| strong discontent towards the district due to not listening and not evaluating our opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9029)|
| 2:30:36| Most were very happy with their own school, not happy with the ongoing testing movement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9036)|
| 2:30:43| a strong dislike towards weekly PLCs, and too much expected from teachers every day and every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9043)|
| 2:30:51| The numbers speak volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9051)|
| 2:30:53| An overwhelming amount of comments were made from around 3,000 teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9053)|
| 2:30:59| I have made two copies for you, and I've given them to Tony Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9059)|
| 2:31:04| I copied all 163 pages, not out of Knox County budget or county commission budget, but I paid for it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9064)|
| 2:31:13| Ma'am, could you go ahead and wrap it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9073)|
| 2:31:15| Yes, I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9075)|
| 2:31:17| Anyway, most of the reformers are not educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9077)|
| 2:31:20| They have very little experience in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9080)|
| 2:31:23| Unfortunately, they have great wealth to produce, great media spin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| and flashy marketing materials to influence the best and brightest that their solution is the best ever created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9087)|
| 2:31:34| This reform is flawed and needs to be thoroughly questioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9094)|
| 2:31:38| and examined by expert educators, not corporate moneymakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9098)|
| 2:31:43| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9103)|
| 2:31:44| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9104)|
| 2:31:52| Lauren Hobson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9112)|
| 2:32:01| Thank you, Mr. Norman and commissioners, for asking teachers to speak today about many issues being brought up in regards to Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9121)|
| 2:32:09| A lot has been said about teachers' recent appearances at school board meetings and discussions with the media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9129)|
| 2:32:14| but before I get to the topic I want to discuss, I just want you and the public to know two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9134)|
| 2:32:20| First of all, as I stated to a New Sentinel reporter three days ago, a statement which did not get reported in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9140)|
| 2:32:26| our continuing outcry may match the definition of a revolt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9146)|
| 2:32:30| but many of us view our actions rather as an exercise in teachers taking back some control of our profession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9150)|
| 2:32:36| from non-educators and those who inaccurately claim to be educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9156)|
| 2:32:41| We are part of an education system not without faults,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9161)|
| 2:32:44| but one that has been responsible for some of the most important technological advances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9164)|
| 2:32:49| and artistic masterpieces in our history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9169)|
| 2:32:52| Only when government has gradually taken more and more control away from those who are actually trained to educate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9172)|
| 2:32:58| have our results come under attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9178)|
| 2:33:00| After all, when is the last time the government took over anything and managed it well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9180)|
| 2:33:05| Currently, money and the unbridled quest for it controls what teachers are allowed to do in the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9185)|
| 2:33:11| yet we are blamed for our system's failure when the results fail to impress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9191)|
| 2:33:15| Secondly, I want you to know that teachers have only taken the public route to communicate our frustrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9195)|
| 2:33:20| because repeated attempts to gain some response or action within the system's chain of command were futile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9200)|
| 2:33:26| Having said that, I would like to address the issue of efficient use of funds in our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9206)|
| 2:33:32| Several years back, the state of Tennessee was awarded $500 million from the president's Race to the Top initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9212)|
| 2:33:38| Knox County is getting some $12 million of that money over four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9218)|
| 2:33:43| Through Dr. McIntyre's diligent efforts, we have received numerous grants totaling in the millions over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9223)|
| 2:33:49| The last one, another $8 million from the state for agreeing, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9229)|
| 2:33:53| to have two observers for one of the two yearly required evaluations of each teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9233)|
| 2:33:58| Since the budget posted online is not terribly specific about how dollars are used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9238)|
| 2:34:03| I can't really tell you how all the millions of dollars are being spent across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9243)|
| 2:34:08| All I can tell you is how this money has been spent or not spent to help my classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9248)|
| 2:34:13| In the last three years since Race to the Top funds were received, the only thing really different in my classroom is one iPad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9253)|
| 2:34:20| this one, and six laptop computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9260)|
| 2:34:23| And the iPad was paid for by my school's PTA with walk-a-thon funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9263)|
| 2:34:27| I actually now get less classroom money to spend than I did three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9267)|
| 2:34:31| I used to receive $100 from state BEP funds and now also $100 from school funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9271)|
| 2:34:38| I still get the same BEP amount, but I get $20 less now from my school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9278)|
| 2:34:43| I know we got new reading textbooks next year that always come with a lot of good resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9283)|
| 2:34:48| and lots of stuff we don't need that just stays in the shrink wrap until the next textbook adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9288)|
| 2:34:53| We got new math books the year before that, again, came with some good resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9293)|
| 2:34:57| and some software that won't work on our computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9297)|
| 2:35:00| We have a scripted reading intervention program that many teachers do not feel is helping our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9300)|
| 2:35:05| Struggling readers in my class have been using it for the last three years and made little progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9305)|
| 2:35:10| at least judged by my test scores, but I have to keep using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9310)|
| 2:35:14| Although the state says the recent $8 million awarded to systems who double up on evaluators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9314)|
| 2:35:19| for score calibration this year is supposed to incur no direct cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9319)|
| 2:35:23| pay for substitutes is sometimes incurred when both evaluators happen to be classroom teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9323)|
| 2:35:29| We are paying out untold amounts of money just for paper costs alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9329)|
| 2:35:32| to administer weekly assessments to be used in data meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9332)|
| 2:35:35| Not everybody has the technology or the training to do this online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9335)|
| 2:35:39| I still have yet to receive an answer about how many thousands of dollars the school system is spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9339)|
| 2:35:44| to administer the SAT-10 test to K-2 students when it is not even aligned to our curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9344)|
| 2:35:50| but will be used to evaluate teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9350)|
| 2:35:53| Thousands of dollars spent on a test that is so developmentally inappropriate in parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9353)|
| 2:35:58| that seven-year-olds are required to answer 45 oral math questions in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9358)|
| 2:36:04| The students must listen to a question read only one time, not repeated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9364)|
| 2:36:08| and make equations on their own to arrive at the correct answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9368)|
| 2:36:12| Seven-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9372)|
| 2:36:14| And they have to do this before taking a short break and starting another hour-plus long session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9374)|
| 2:36:19| As I told the school board several months ago, upwards of $600,000, give or take a few absences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9379)|
| 2:36:25| or teachers opting for in-service credit, was spent to train teachers of technology grant schools on their new devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9385)|
| 2:36:31| Only about 12 of 60 hours were actually spent on devices, but we did learn about Twitter and Pinterest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9391)|
| 2:36:38| The training on our new learning management system was so ineffective that upon returning to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9398)|
| 2:36:43| most of us did not even know how to upload grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9403)|
| 2:36:46| Hundreds of thousands of dollars are being spent on salaries for educational coaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9406)|
| 2:36:50| Some of them are great assets to their school, but some have less classroom experience than the teachers they coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9410)|
| 2:36:56| The system is spending over a million dollars on the APEC strategic compensation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9416)|
| 2:37:00| that many teachers dislike for its arbitrary nature and divisive effects on teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9420)|
| 2:37:05| Although our administration will tell you that teachers want this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9425)|
| 2:37:08| I think you will find a different answer if you actually ask teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9428)|
| 2:37:12| Teachers will not work harder because you pay them a bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9432)|
| 2:37:16| A good teacher is already working as hard as he or she can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9436)|
| 2:37:19| and needs to be compensated adequately for the job they already do that extends way past contract time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9439)|
| 2:37:25| More money will not make ineffective teachers better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9445)|
| 2:37:28| I can tell you that there are 28 members of the central office executive and leadership team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9448)|
| 2:37:33| I'm sure they all have very important jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9453)|
| 2:37:35| but I cannot tell you how very many of them affect my day-to-day life in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9455)|
| 2:37:40| I'm going to wrap it up here in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9460)|
| 2:37:43| Knox County is apparently paying the Parthenon Group, a Boston-based consulting firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9463)|
| 2:37:47| $350,000 a month, I believe, if I'm reading the data correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9467)|
| 2:37:52| to advise us that it would be beneficial to increase class size and administrative support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9472)|
| 2:37:57| while phasing out money to compensate teachers for advanced degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9477)|
| 2:38:00| Whether their salary comes straight from the school system or is offset by grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9480)|
| 2:38:04| that is still money not showing up in my classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9484)|
| 2:38:07| That money could pay the salaries of seven teachers or at least 14 aides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9487)|
| 2:38:11| Other than that, I cannot tell you how all this money we have received from the state or other grants has been spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9491)|
| 2:38:16| I just know it hasn't shown up in my classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9496)|
| 2:38:19| I and several other teachers from my school told Dr. McIntyre at a public forum his first year in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9499)|
| 2:38:24| that we don't need another program or set of textbooks just because it's an adoption year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9504)|
| 2:38:29| We need another person in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9509)|
| 2:38:31| We have gotten other stuff, much of it unsolicited, but we haven't gotten that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9511)|
| 2:38:36| Teachers were noticeably absent from budget talks last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9516)|
| 2:38:39| but as I have told many people, if additional money was being requested to lower class size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9519)|
| 2:38:44| or increase the number of aides in classrooms, teachers would be picketing in the streets in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9524)|
| 2:38:49| My comments today are not meant to sway commissioners' opinions in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9529)|
| 2:38:53| or to necessarily have any bearing on future political decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9533)|
| 2:38:57| but my opinion for once was asked for, and I have given it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9537)|
| 2:39:01| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9541)|
| 2:39:09| Amber Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9549)|
| 2:39:16| Hi. Amber Roundtree, 2604 Fisher Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9556)|
| 2:39:20| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9560)|
| 2:39:21| I'd like to thank Mr. Norman and the rest of the commission for the opportunity to let us come and speak to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9561)|
| 2:39:27| As an elementary school librarian, my goal is to develop a lifelong love of reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9567)|
| 2:39:32| Librarians are responsible not only for teaching a curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9572)|
| 2:39:35| but developing the library collection, repairing books, preparing book orders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9575)|
| 2:39:39| and providing materials that help support classroom teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9579)|
| 2:39:43| Research shows that when funding for school libraries rises, reading scores also rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9583)|
| 2:39:49| In the past five years, my library budget and the library budgets across the county have decreased by 7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9589)|
| 2:39:56| Unfortunately, lack of funding has been a concern for all the related arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9596)|
| 2:40:01| Not only are we asked to do more with less funding but also with time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9601)|
| 2:40:05| Many related arts teachers must now teach a reading or math intervention class to our students that need the most help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9605)|
| 2:40:13| So our students that are the lowest readers and math learners are being taught by teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9613)|
| 2:40:18| that may not have educational experience in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9618)|
| 2:40:21| With the demands placed on our classroom teachers to meet Common Core and TCAP standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9621)|
| 2:40:26| we're asked to accommodate reading and math in related arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9626)|
| 2:40:30| While our curriculums certainly complement these areas, they should not and will not replace our curriculum subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9630)|
| 2:40:38| In classes like PE, movement is being reduced to allow time for written expression solely because it's part of the rubric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9638)|
| 2:40:46| Librarians are told that if an evaluator walks in and our students are, quote, just reading, we need to be prepared to defend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9646)|
| 2:40:55| In middle schools, the art and music time has been cut to allow for additional intervention time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9655)|
| 2:41:01| Next month, many middle and high school libraries will close for extended periods solely so those libraries can be used for testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9661)|
| 2:41:09| The students are suffering because the focus on tested subject areas detracts time for physical, social, and emotional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9669)|
| 2:41:17| Stress levels are on the rise because we do not focus on the whole child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9677)|
| 2:41:22| During our last Discovery Ed testing window, one of my library helpers was absent from school due to a stomach ache brought on by test anxiety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9682)|
| 2:41:31| Last year, another library helper during TCAP time came in every morning in tears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9691)|
| 2:41:38| I wish these were the exception to the rule, but unfortunately, they are now the norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9698)|
| 2:41:43| The focus on data has taken away our students' creative exploration simply because it can't be measured quantitatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9703)|
| 2:41:50| There's a correlation between exposure to arts and school success, yet this has been largely ignored by the data-driven culture of our school board and our superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9710)|
| 2:42:00| As author Philip Pullman said, we are simply creating a generation that hates reading and feels nothing but hostility for literature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9720)|
| 2:42:08| This year, I was only able to buy one book for every five students at my school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9728)|
| 2:42:14| And for many students in Knox County, this is the only library they have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9734)|
| 2:42:19| I have concerns that the funding decisions made by our school board has solely data and not our students in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9739)|
| 2:42:26| I have to wonder, as some of you do, where is the money going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9746)|
| 2:42:30| Perhaps to educational coaches who are supposed to improve veteran teachers who haven't scored high enough on a flawed assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9750)|
| 2:42:37| Or the price to administer the SAT-10 developmentally inappropriate test for our K-2 students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9757)|
| 2:42:45| Why does Knox County Schools need a PR department with six staff members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9765)|
| 2:42:50| Why has KCS accepted many grants from the Gates Foundation and others that have strings attached?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9770)|
| 2:42:57| Why did we spend $360,000 to pay Parthenon Consulting Group for an investment analysis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9777)|
| 2:43:06| Parthenon supports for-profit education, not public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9786)|
| 2:43:12| Our limited funds must be used in ways that directly affect the educational outcomes of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9792)|
| 2:43:19| In Dr. McIntyre's recent action plan, he stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9799)|
| 2:43:23| We will not compromise our high standards and rigorous expectations for our children or our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9803)|
| 2:43:30| I do not believe any of the students, parents, or educators who spoke at various board meetings want to lower the standards for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9810)|
| 2:43:39| Nor do I, as an educator, want lower standards for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9819)|
| 2:43:43| but it is complete madness to hold my professional teaching license, along with a license of 50% of KCS staff, hostage based on a test result of a subject I do not teach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9823)|
| 2:43:56| Rather, we would like Dr. McIntyre and the board to exercise caution when implementing policies that are detrimental to our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9836)|
| 2:44:04| like cutting related arts budgets and additional testing that is not state-mandated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9844)|
| 2:44:08| In the recent teacher survey, there were over 350 individual comments about too much testing in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9848)|
| 2:44:16| The data-driven culture in Knox County schools is not excellence for all children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9856)|
| 2:44:21| and the students in our communities deserve the opportunity to become well-rounded students, not test-taking experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9861)|
| 2:44:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9868)|
| 2:44:36| Robert Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9876)|
| 2:44:46| I'm Robert Taylor. I live at 1735 Blackwood Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9886)|
| 2:44:51| I originally wasn't going to speak this evening. I was just here to listen and support my fellow educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9891)|
| 2:44:56| Commissioner Norman, your opening remarks inspired me to come up here and speak before the entire commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9896)|
| 2:45:02| I'll be winging it tonight, so I hope you all will bear with me if I stutter too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9902)|
| 2:45:07| I'm not sure that I'm comfortable in this forum speaking specifically about any Knox County practices or policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9907)|
| 2:45:14| What I can speak about without a script is my story, and it starts out a little oddly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9914)|
| 2:45:20| In 1991, I bought a mountain bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9920)|
| 2:45:24| A week later, I decided to enter a mountain bike race to get the free T-shirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9924)|
| 2:45:29| Four miles into it, I was on the side of the trail throwing up all over myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9929)|
| 2:45:33| I thought, that's not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9933)|
| 2:45:36| This was in 1991. In 2003, I retired as a professional endurance athlete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9936)|
| 2:45:43| That's the kind of person I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| I will not accept anything the best from myself for anything that I undertake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9945)|
| 2:45:49| I can say the same for my fellow educators sitting behind me this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9949)|
| 2:45:55| Ever since I left college, I took pride in accepting the most difficult jobs that I could find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9955)|
| 2:46:00| and giving all of my effort into doing my very best at those jobs I have worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9960)|
| 2:46:05| As a child abuse investigator, I've worked in inpatient mental health, inpatient drug and alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9965)|
| 2:46:12| I've worked in a level four juvenile correctional institution, working with juvenile felons, teaching them how to climb and repel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9972)|
| 2:46:21| I've worked in special ed in various capacities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9981)|
| 2:46:25| Originally subcontracted through a community mental health center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9985)|
| 2:46:29| Since the late 90s, I was hired into Knox County Proper in 2003 as a behavior liaison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=9989)|
| 2:46:40| I got my current teaching assignment in 2006, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10000)|
| 2:46:45| And the reason I took that assignment was because I had heard the teacher had walked out because of the difficulty of the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10005)|
| 2:46:51| I thought if anyone can take that classroom and earn the right to call themselves a behavior specialist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10011)|
| 2:46:57| which is what I was called, it should have been me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10017)|
| 2:47:00| And I'm still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10020)|
| 2:47:02| I took that classroom over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10022)|
| 2:47:04| I was told by a former principal that I was one of the best special education teachers in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10024)|
| 2:47:09| And I still believe that that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10029)|
| 2:47:11| I've had many of the most difficult and challenging special ed students sent to my classroom specifically because I was the teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10031)|
| 2:47:18| And they have been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10038)|
| 2:47:20| And I'm sure that those students and their parents would agree with that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10040)|
| 2:47:26| When the team evaluation rubric came about, I thought, well, it's change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10046)|
| 2:47:31| And as we're all fond of hearing, change is hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10051)|
| 2:47:33| I did the best I could for my students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10053)|
| 2:47:36| I wasn't very worried either when a supervisor told me that as I teach what's called a failing subgroup based on their test scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10056)|
| 2:47:43| as most special ed classrooms will be, that I would probably be lucky to score a rock-solid three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10063)|
| 2:47:49| lest I be an outlier, which administrators don't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10069)|
| 2:47:54| I still did the best for my students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10074)|
| 2:47:55| I still felt that I was successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10075)|
| 2:47:58| My classroom is a multi-age classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10078)|
| 2:48:01| I have kindergartners and fifth graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| Right now, my youngest student is five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10083)|
| 2:48:05| My oldest is 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10085)|
| 2:48:06| I teach five grade levels at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10086)|
| 2:48:09| The students are with me all day long, every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10089)|
| 2:48:12| I'm evaluated by the same rubric as a 12th grade chemistry teacher or as a second grade regular ed teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10092)|
| 2:48:19| I still do my best for my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10099)|
| 2:48:22| As APEX was introduced, I worked a few extra hours, two, three hours extra a night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10102)|
| 2:48:28| five or six hours over the course of the weekend planning for the multiple grades that I teach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10108)|
| 2:48:33| aligning my lessons with the rubric, and doing the best for my kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10113)|
| 2:48:37| I also coach baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10117)|
| 2:48:40| Two years in a row, I coach my son to our league's championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10120)|
| 2:48:44| I served as the pitcher for our team and proudly threw my son his first home run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10124)|
| 2:48:51| Another great moment for me, not even related to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10131)|
| 2:48:57| I was able to score some threes and fours the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10137)|
| 2:49:00| I earned an APEX bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10140)|
| 2:49:05| I continued to plan for my students, three, four hours a night sometimes, up to 18 hours on the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10145)|
| 2:49:13| Coached my son and our team to another league championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10153)|
| 2:49:17| As the pressure continued for mandates that some from Nashville, some locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10157)|
| 2:49:23| of what teachers were expected to do and how that would be measured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10163)|
| 2:49:26| and what that needed to look like in the classroom, I began to spend even more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10166)|
| 2:49:32| I could no longer have the time to coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10172)|
| 2:49:34| I took my son out of baseball to spend more time doing what was right for my students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10174)|
| 2:49:39| and to meet Knox County's expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10179)|
| 2:49:44| This past year, I sat by my sister and my mother and watched my stepdad pass away on April 25th at 626 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10184)|
| 2:49:54| I was back in my classroom that same day by 1030 to ensure that my weekly lesson plan was being followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10194)|
| 2:50:00| so that my students would be on task and on schedule if I were to have received an unannounced observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10200)|
| 2:50:08| Also that spring, I was informed that my wife wished to file for divorce in large part due to my unavailability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10208)|
| 2:50:19| as a husband and as a father to our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10219)|
| 2:50:23| I'm not saying that any of these problems are the result of any administrator, any policy, any supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10223)|
| 2:50:32| These are a result of my own choice to advance, perform, and excel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10232)|
| 2:50:40| The apex bonus I received this year was just enough to pay my outstanding medical bills for stress-related illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10240)|
| 2:50:49| And I can tell the commission this, those two $1,500 checks were not worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10249)|
| 2:50:55| I would sign them right back over to our superintendent tonight if I could have my health and my family back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10255)|
| 2:51:03| And I'll finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10263)|
| 2:51:05| I know that coming up here before you and saying such personal things will probably lead me to be criticized and ridiculed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10265)|
| 2:51:13| If you've ever seen the reader comments in the Knoxville News Sentinel, you all probably know what's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10273)|
| 2:51:18| But I don't speak for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10278)|
| 2:51:20| I'm a lifelong resident of Knox County Schools, and these teachers behind me are some of the best people I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10280)|
| 2:51:26| I know that I do not speak only for them and for me, but for the over 4,000 teachers, the over 3,000 teachers that responded to the survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10286)|
| 2:51:37| I know that I speak for them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10297)|
| 2:51:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10300)|
| 2:51:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10302)|
| 2:51:50| That's all we have that have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10310)|
| 2:51:53| And then I guess what my desire is, is, you know, we talked earlier about the retreat and the topics of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10313)|
| 2:52:02| I've got a few questions that we'll discuss, hopefully, as two bodies at the retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10322)|
| 2:52:09| And so bring those topics, bring that information with you, questions that you may have, and then things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10329)|
| 2:52:18| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10338)|
| 2:52:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10340)|
| 2:52:22| Ladies and gentlemen who have come tonight to speak and to listen and to support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10342)|
| 2:52:29| I would like to add my thank yous to Commissioner Norman's comments earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10349)|
| 2:52:37| As I mentioned last week at our workshop meeting, I do not think that your message is getting to the total public the way it needs to be gotten to the total public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10357)|
| 2:52:53| We have a forum, a public forum here every month at our commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10373)|
| 2:52:59| and I know that folks watch the commission meetings on the television probably more than school board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10379)|
| 2:53:08| I would also encourage you, never give up, never give up, never give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10388)|
| 2:53:15| I have three teachers that I could name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10395)|
| 2:53:18| Let me rephrase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10398)|
| 2:53:21| teachers that I could name in my neighborhood who have left teaching not because they were old and retired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10401)|
| 2:53:31| but just for some of the reasons that I've heard here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10411)|
| 2:53:36| And I'm punching my mute button and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10416)|
| 2:53:41| So don't give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10421)|
| 2:53:44| I've been talking to a lot of you and a lot of others for the last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10424)|
| 2:53:49| and I've accumulated about a six-inch thick briefcase full of correspondence, of comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10429)|
| 2:53:58| totally mirroring everything that has been said here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10438)|
| 2:54:02| I know we have some problems there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10442)|
| 2:54:06| I have been trying to get that word across to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10446)|
| 2:54:14| But we can't tell them how to spend the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10454)|
| 2:54:18| All we can do is give them the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10458)|
| 2:54:21| But my main object tonight is to get your word out to the people that elect those nine people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10461)|
| 2:54:29| that are spending our tax money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10469)|
| 2:54:38| And in a lot of cases, blowing it where it's not needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10478)|
| 2:54:44| My total commitment right now, and I'm not seeing their budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10484)|
| 2:54:50| but I will not vote for one penny increase in a school budget this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10490)|
| 2:54:57| We ask all of our other departments to live within their budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10497)|
| 2:55:01| They managed to get the job done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| There's too much money being blown on the other side of the street that could be getting some of these things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10503)|
| 2:55:12| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10512)|
| 2:55:14| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10514)|
| 2:55:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10516)|
| 2:55:17| And I want to thank each of you for being here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10517)|
| 2:55:19| One of the earlier gentlemen said that our main interest in education was probably financial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10519)|
| 2:55:25| And I want to just say personally that there is some truth to that because we have to approve the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10525)|
| 2:55:32| I also want to say, though, that education for me is an extremely personal thing because my wife is a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10532)|
| 2:55:38| She got a degree in deaf education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10538)|
| 2:55:40| She has taught the deaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10540)|
| 2:55:42| I also have a daughter who has taught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10542)|
| 2:55:46| She got a master's degree, by the way, and she was working on her doctorate degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10546)|
| 2:55:50| and she wanted to be a principal or she wanted to be a college professor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10550)|
| 2:55:55| After eight years of teaching, I got a phone call from her, and we were talking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10555)|
| 2:56:01| and I first heard the term no teacher left standing from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10561)|
| 2:56:05| I also heard these words on more than one occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10565)|
| 2:56:08| Dad, I just wish that they would consider me an asset and not a liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10568)|
| 2:56:19| So after eight years, she has left teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10579)|
| 2:56:25| Her words, I'm disgusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10585)|
| 2:56:29| She said that she just can't take it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10589)|
| 2:56:32| The stress that you all have talked about she felt, and she did not teach in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10592)|
| 2:56:37| So these issues are issues that are not only here in Knox County, but they're in other places as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10597)|
| 2:56:45| My kids are products of the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10605)|
| 2:56:48| And, Sherry, you know, you taught them, and they went to Bearden High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10608)|
| 2:56:52| I'm very pleased with the way they've turned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10612)|
| 2:56:54| They all have advanced degrees and are doing quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| So I don't feel that the system has failed my kids in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10616)|
| 2:57:01| But that was a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10621)|
| 2:57:04| And so I just wanted you to say that I have – I wanted to say to you I have four grandchildren| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10624)|
| 2:57:11| that are getting ready to enter Knox County schools, four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10631)|
| 2:57:14| So, yes, I'm concerned about the financial end, but I'm also concerned about what's going to happen to these four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10634)|
| 2:57:21| I'm also concerned about the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10641)|
| 2:57:23| Because when my daughter, who spent her time and her effort to get a master's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10643)|
| 2:57:27| and working on a doctorate in education, says to me, I can't take it anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10647)|
| 2:57:33| I know what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10653)|
| 2:57:34| I know the stress and strain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10654)|
| 2:57:37| You know, Sherry and I had this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10657)|
| 2:57:39| She had a – well, I probably shouldn't say – she had a student threaten to kill her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10659)|
| 2:57:44| Now, that's the extreme, way extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10664)|
| 2:57:48| But I'm just saying that the pressures that you face every day are not just in testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10668)|
| 2:57:53| We're asking you to do a lot of things in the classroom every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10673)|
| 2:57:56| We're asking you to take care of our kids, our grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10676)|
| 2:58:00| We're asking you to watch over them eight hours a day and to do your very, very best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10680)|
| 2:58:04| And you're trying to do that, and I know you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10684)|
| 2:58:06| And you're not doing this for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10686)|
