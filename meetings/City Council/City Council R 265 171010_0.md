| 0:02:31| community plan, we're asking that that be postponed for four weeks and the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=151)|
| 0:02:39| item is 12D and that is the Midway Road rezoning and they're asking for a two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=159)|
| 0:02:47| week postponement on that and both sides are in agreement and certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| council is they they're working they're working on some engineering revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=172)|
| 0:02:57| and whatnot that need to be done. Second. Okay, so we've got 12B, the East County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=177)|
| 0:03:04| sector plan to postpone for four weeks and 12D, Midway, for two weeks. Okay, any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=184)|
| 0:03:14| discussion? All in favor say aye. Any opposed? Those are both postponed as stated. Okay, any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=194)|
| 0:03:23| items to be added by motion? Mayor Brown? Yes, Mayor, I'd like to add my motion. 202 requests from the East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=203)|
| 0:03:34| Tennessee Community Design Center and add $200 donation to that. Okay, so we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=214)|
| 0:03:44| this ordinance before us, emergency ordinance. Would you like this to be put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| on the consent agenda like the other 202s? Yes. Okay, so we have a motion and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| second. And I would like to amend that. Okay. And make the total $600. You'll need to not put it on the consent agenda, put it on the regular agenda if you're going to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=233)|
| 0:04:20| I think it'll pass one way or the other. Okay, so right now it's $200, you're amending it to make it $600? Correct. Okay, you have what you need? Yes, ma'am. Okay, so we are adding this ordinance, it's an emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=260)|
| 0:04:39| ordinance, but will not be on the consent agenda. And we have a motion, do we have a second? Second. Okay, so we have a motion and a second to add this. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=279)|
| 0:04:49| discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Okay, that is added to the agenda and so that goes. It'll be 12N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=289)|
| 0:05:00| Mayor, I'll move to approve the consent items 11Q, Certificate of Compliance, and 12I to 12M, the 202s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=300)|
| 0:05:27| that are other than this added one. Thank you for moving us on. We have a motion and a second to approve the consent items. Any discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The consent items are approved. For the Mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=327)|
| 0:05:48| report, first you'll be surprised for me to remind you that we're in the middle of a City Council election. We talk about this every time, and we will until November 7th. Early voting will begin next Wednesday, October 18th, and continue through Thursday, November 2nd. So October 18th through Thursday, November 2nd. The actual election day is Tuesday, November 7th, but we of course always encourage people to early vote. As a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=348)|
| 0:06:18| reminder, in the general election, every registered City of Knoxville voter can vote in all five City Council races. And I keep repeating that because I still get emails from people who think that you all vote on issues, but they don't have a chance to vote on you, right? And I have to remind them that actually they can in the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=378)|
| 0:06:42| I'll repeat that one more time. Seriously, okay, so people still think how unfair it is that some of Council can vote on issues in their neighborhoods, and they believe that they can't, they don't have a vote on who represents, who sits at this Council. But we know that that is incorrect, and so I have to reply back and remind them that, of course, just to dig into this a little deeper, if you're an at-large, you run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=402)|
| 0:07:11| citywide, both in the primary and in the general. But for the six district representatives, all of whom, well, five of whom are term limited this year, you run in your district for the district seat in the primary. The top two vote getters move on to the general. So that's where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=431)|
| 0:07:31| So there are five races, five districts, with two candidates each, plus a certified write-in candidate in one race. So everybody in the city who's a registered voter can vote for each of those district seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=451)|
| 0:07:49| You can find more information about all the candidates and details about the election by going on our website at govotenoxville.com. And detailed information about early voting times and their locations is online at the Election Commission website at noxcounty.org slash election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=469)|
| 0:08:09| As we've been saying, all of us have been saying time and time again, the elections are vitally important to the future of our city. In just a few months, we'll have five new City Council members sitting up here, five out of nine, so that's the majority. So make sure you help us choose how those people will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=489)|
| 0:08:27| Okay, moving on. Next Monday, October 16th, we'll be with Chief Sharp and his staff at 1130 in the morning to host the annual firefighter memorial service and the retirees luncheon at the headquarters fire station at 600 West Summit Hill Drive downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=507)|
| 0:08:47| This is an opportunity to pay tribute to all of the firefighters throughout the history of the fire department who died in the line of duty. We also recognize the retirees who passed away in the last year. So we encourage everyone to come join us for that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=527)|
| 0:09:05| And finally, I want to recognize Cheryl Ely, our new Parks and Recreation Director. As you all know, Joe Walsh retired. We had a very nice retirement reception and video for him. It was very nice. But Cheryl, we mentioned you two weeks ago, but I know you weren't able to be here then, so welcome aboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=545)|
| 0:09:25| Gosh, I thought Joe would be here just to watch the meeting. Joe was very confident in his retirement. But of course, he's always welcome to come back. Okay, so now reports of Council members. Anybody? No? Okay, we'll move on then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=565)|
| 0:09:47| 8A is a resolution confirming the reappointment of Ferris Ede and the appointment of Daytonia C. Mitchell to the Historic Zoning Commission. Move for second. We have a motion and a second. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=587)|
| 0:10:04| 9A is an ordinance to amend the operating and capital budgets for fiscal year 2017-2018. Move to approve. Second. We have a motion and a second. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=604)|
| 0:10:18| 9B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B Zoning Regulations to update the City of Knoxville Parking Ordinance. Okay, who wants to start on this? Councilman Della Veppe? Yes. I should also tell you we have one person to speak against the proposed ordinance who signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=618)|
| 0:10:41| I think this is going to be fairly simple. There's just a few technical changes that have come to our attention through Mr. Green and Carlene Malone and we've had the ordinance, of course, recompiled so we can see all the words in the right places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=641)|
| 0:10:59| If we look at section C3, which has to do with location and setbacks, I'll tell you what page that is in your magic booklet here. C3 deals with the setbacks and, of course, we've talked about this at some length, but the bottom line is there's a language correction on C3 and it appears on page 32 of the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=659)|
| 0:11:29| We are going to strike the words front yard in the first line of C3 so that it will now read minimum death of the setback of a parking lot, measured from the edge of the parking lot, blah, blah, blah, so many feet. And that was going to avoid confusion with whether we're talking perimeter or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=689)|
| 0:11:52| That's different than what I have here. This just shows yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Well, we've had a conversation yet after the sheet of paper came out so that I think Mr. Green and Ms. Malone have agreed that the fix, they had two different fixes to the same problem, but we're going to delete the words front yard and I'll make that as a motion that we change that. I can either tell you the other ones or we can take them one at a time. I don't know how you want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=714)|
| 0:12:16| Let's do them one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| Okay, so first in C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| Strike the words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| Well, first of all, I need a motion to approve. We don't have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Okay, so now we need...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| A motion to amend by striking C3, the words in C3 that say front yard in the first line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| Okay, and we had a second for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| We're on course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| Yeah, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| Okay, so is there any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Okay, so we'll vote on deleting the words front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| Okay, that amendment is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| The other change that's recommended is striking in several places all under the general category of J2C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=780)|
| 0:13:13| and you have that in the handout you got from Mr. Green, but if you look at 2C1, 2C2, and 2C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=793)|
| 0:13:22| there was a parenthetical phrase or a phrase in apposition that said or, in the second line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| or if utilities exist, comma, to the utility maintenance zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| That little descriptive clause is being struck in both C1, C2, and C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=814)|
| 0:13:41| and that was recommended by Director Green as a technical amendment to kind of clean up the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=821)|
| 0:13:49| I don't know if he wants to address that any further, but we're just cleaning up the text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| So that's your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| Gerald Green, MPC Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| It was pointed out by some members of the community that that provision would make development of some properties more restrictive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=839)|
| 0:14:08| create a larger basically perimeter undeveloped area around the parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| Unnecessary since developers plant in the KUB utility easement currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| Staff is comfortable with that revision and recommends it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| So with that, I would ask that that motion be voted on at this time unless there's further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Is there any other discussion on that second amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| What's the number of that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| J2C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| J2C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| 1, 2, and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| It's in this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| So that is the second amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| That amendment is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| And there was a third proposal, but I believe that that is now withdrawn for the time being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| It was a discussion about item C3E, I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=901)|
| 0:15:08| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| Item C3E was going to be added, but it's been decided that in a discussion with Mr. Green and Ms. Malone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=909)|
| 0:15:18| that maybe we'll add confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| So rather than get involved in a nuance here, we're going to leave the addition out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=920)|
| 0:15:27| and if it turns out in practice it's needed, some other council can sit there and make the correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| So is there any addition to that, either Mr. Green or Ms. Malone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| So that concludes my proposed changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Now I want to ask Peter, is there anything that we need to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Mr. Law Director, what would you like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| Let me just say that I think those are both not substantive matters that we require to go back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=949)|
| 0:15:56| So if you adopt it as amended twice now, then you would be passing it on second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| and it will not come back next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=963)|

| 0:18:49| We are selling five properties tonight through our Homemakers Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| Several of these have been acquired by the City because they are chronically blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| There are a couple that are tax-foreclosed parcels that the City got through a tax sale that we're able to sell for redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1139)|

| 0:19:19| And so rather than us foreclosing or them selling, they gave us the house, and we were able to resell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1159)|
| 0:19:26| All of these will be redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| They'll be back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1168)|

| 0:19:32| And three of them are being developed for lower-income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| And the bottom line is we're taking the bad apple out of the barrel and shining it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| and putting a healthy one back in its place, and the neighborhood's going to live happily ever after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1180)|

| 0:23:37| They'll be noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| They'll be noticed of that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| Be noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| That's an in-house process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| In-house completely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| But they do have design standards that they have to meet in order to fit the infill design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| I would just encourage Habitat to be sure that they follow those guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Yeah, we'll make sure that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1441)|

| 0:24:10| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Whaley Construction LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| for the Cedar Lane sidewalk project for an amount not to exceed $301,434.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1456)|

| 0:24:25| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| I had a discussion earlier with Mr. Hagerman and I think if you would address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| Also, the fact that several people had contacted me and wondered how this one got ahead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| other projects or why we're doing this one as opposed to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| Sounds like West Hills to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| I want to march.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| As many of you are aware, we do maintain a priority list that is scored on various characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1491)|
| 0:25:01| for guidance of the mayor's decision about which project to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| The year that this project was funded, it was number two tied for one other project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1507)|
| 0:25:16| All three of those top projects got funded that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| So these were actually, as you know, there's a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| You don't just fund it this year and build it immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| There's the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| There's all the different processes we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| So the ones that you see now were actually approved a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| I just want a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| So the public knew because of the whole situation with sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| And I do know we're doing a new study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Which is really going to be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Thank you for bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1546)|

| 0:25:51| 11G is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a cost reimbursement agreement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1551)|

| 0:26:00| conduit replacement for traffic signal upgrades along Blount Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| I thought you were going for your light there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| I noticed Don Michelle's name is on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| But it almost sounds like Jim Hagerman's crew noticed that someone was digging in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| and could save a few bucks if we piled on to their contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| But will one of you just tell us what we're doing here on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| Well, I'm not sure whose idea it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| But it was certainly an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| The city's idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| It was an opportunity waiting to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| They were going to have the city torn up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| They were going to have the street torn up anyway for these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| We just needed a conduit for the communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| And it was an opportunity to get the work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| Rather than paving the road than digging it up to put the conduit in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| And rather than digging up the same trench again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1615)|

| 0:29:50| One of the things, and Aaron Browning is here also, that will be able to answer a couple of those questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| but it was just easier to go ahead and split it out because the work that we're asking for inside our buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1795)|
| 0:30:02| are a little different than what we're asking for outside the bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| One guy's polishing floors and that kind of thing, and the other guy's doing outdoor work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| 11N is a resolution authorizing the mayor to amend contract number, excuse me, contract C-17-0336| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1818)|
| 0:30:26| with Anderson Lumber Company Incorporated to increase the scope of the sanitary laundry building roof repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| to replace a significant number of additional beams resulting in an additional cost of $57,009| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1832)|
| 0:30:41| for a new contract amount not to exceed $564,151.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Don Michelle, I just wanted to ask, so once they pulled off the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| they didn't know those beams were that damaged until they pulled the roof off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| Is that, or Ann, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| Hi, Ann Wallace, Deputy Director for the Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| I'm managing the project for the sanitary laundry building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| Councilman Wallace, basically we had a structural engineer come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| and do a visual inspection of the roof prior to putting out the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| and they literally outlined a number of areas that they saw damage to the beams and the supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1878)|
| 0:31:25| Unfortunately, once you peel back the roof and the other material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| we did find additional beams and support structure that was deteriorated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| that you would not have been able to see without removing those parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| So, unfortunately, it happens in an old building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| but we're pleased to see that the work is moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| and progressing significantly on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| But that exposed all the damaged ones you built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| I mean, you're not anticipating there being other damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| You've exposed it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| I'm not anticipating any more in terms of the beams and the decking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| We do have some issues that are coming up with the clear story windows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| and I'm waiting for some information from our architect who's on the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| to provide more information back to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| Basically, the roof is developed in three parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| There are two portions that are flat on the east and west side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| and in the middle, there's an area that pops up taller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| Thankfully, it didn't have the fenestrations that were on either side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| but it does have clear story windows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| and those windows, unfortunately, have not been maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| since the property was vacated in 1993,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| and obviously almost 30 years of neglect has left them in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| where we're going to have to look at some structural changes there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| That was an earlier like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| I sure hope you get about $100 million or something for this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| If I may take an opportunity and privilege,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| I'm pleased to say that both the sanitary laundry site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| and the former McClung warehouses will be presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| as brownfield redevelopment sites at the National Brownfield Conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| in Pittsburgh in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| and as part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| Brownfield's listings is going to be promoting these two properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| so we'll be getting national attention on both of these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| Hopefully some national investment later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| Good auctioneer to raise the prices for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| Tim, you can buy these if you need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| It's a great opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| It's going to be ready for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| The windows are going to be washed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| 11-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| 11-0 is a resolution authorizing the mayor to request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| the public building authority to perform construction management services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| to manage and facilitate the design and construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| of the additional 2.5 levels of the State Street Garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| in an amount not to exceed $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| I know Rick Emmett's probably here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| so I just wanted to ask Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| I know there's been some issues and complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| maybe challenges with ingress and egress out of that garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2037)|
| 0:34:03| and I just wondered if those will be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| since part of this is for design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| Is some of that going to be considered as we add on more stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| and more floors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| I know there's some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Maybe there's some improvements that can be made to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| I just wanted you to speak to that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| Sure, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| Rick Emmett, downtown coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| Yes, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| We are going to look at the entrances and exits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| All of our garages have challenges when lots of folks are leaving at once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| as we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| But that garage, you know, it's already got 1,100 cars in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| Put another 500 or 600 cars in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| that's going to be a big challenge for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| So, yes, we're looking at the entrances and exits both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| and probably going to try to add an exit on Clinch, we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| It's kind of steep over there, and then we're looking at the exits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| and just the circulation inside the garage in general too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| And I believe we've done a study, a traffic study as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| for the area and for the garage to try to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| that we're doing the best job we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| Kristen Grove is here with PBA as our architect, and Jane Bird as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| If anybody has any particular questions on the future design or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| You made some changes to Marcus Square Garage a few years back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| that made a pretty good difference on getting in and out and more expediently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| And I was just hoping now is the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| since you're adding so many more parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| you're going to consider that again on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| At Marcus Square Garage we eliminated, as you know, a lane of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| for a wider path and a better radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| It eliminated some spaces, but it also . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| It made circulation much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Yes, Rick, what's the timeline on that once you get it approved and start working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| We've already done quite a lot of preliminary work on it, Mayor Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| so I'm hoping that we can get this thing started about March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| We'll be getting an RFP out for a contractor here pretty shortly, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| probably by the end of this year with the goal of starting March or April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| and hope for about a year's construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| The garage will stay in play, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| We'll probably have to eliminate one level of the garage, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| the upper deck clearly for the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| That's 240 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| It's going to be a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| Vice Mayor Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Rick, would you also explain the fact that we have air rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| and that the building can go higher as far as residential and that sort of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| Sure, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| We're pretty pleased to find out that we can do more on that garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| than maybe we thought we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| We're going up this extra quarter of a level for these extra spaces here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| But on top of that, we can go up another quarter level of parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| and four more levels potentially of office or residential in the future through some RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| you know, so we can pretty much lease out the air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| or sell out the air rights and maybe even skin some of the front of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| We've looked some at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| and we think it's probably doable depending on what the proposal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| So pretty excited about having that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Thanks, Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| 11P is a resolution authorizing the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| to negotiate and accept from Dover Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| payments in lieu of ad valorem taxes with respect to property located at 953 Moody Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| and finding that such payments are deemed to be in the furtherance of the public purposes of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| as defined in Tennessee Code Annotated Section 7-53-305.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Councilman Dallivant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| Yeah, Don and Michelle, I'm having a sort of a deja vu moment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| You know, we did something to approve some kind of financial tax assistance in the past on this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2249)|
| 0:37:36| Maybe I'm dreaming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Maybe it's just the award of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| But is this pilot replacing something else or is this the first time we are doing a tax-type credit incentive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| Don and Michelle Foster, Director, Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| I think the first thing was just the purchase sale agreement that we had on the building initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| So this is the first attempt to help make the financing work and the financial payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| The RFP has been involved in several various phases of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| starting with demolition of neglect and actually buying the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| and then putting out the RFP and having Mr. Dover as a sole person to submit the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2289)|
| 0:38:16| So we're moving forward with helping him with the development assistance with the pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| to provide some opportunity to develop the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| The second type of question is why 25 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| I didn't see any analysis in the back that showed that a third party had looked at that or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| but that's an awfully long time to defer the, what, tax realization of the larger full market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2313)|
| 0:38:43| I didn't know if it could be a lesser term or it could be stair-stepped where the taxes kick in after 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2323)|
| 0:38:50| Now we'll get Dr. Lyons to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| Thanks, Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| Yes, this one did not go through a third party review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| There's a little complexity to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| Originally this was going to fall under the procedure where the mayor can sign off under a program that's through Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2340)|
| 0:39:10| And it turned out they didn't have the capacity to rewrite theirs to take care of elder housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| So we never anticipated getting any tax revenue from the get-go on this because of the low-income senior housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2356)|
| 0:39:23| And I think in pursuing it and looking just at the numbers Mr. Dover provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2363)|
| 0:39:29| and the state of the building and its deterioration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| and given the fact that this is a city project that we went out for bid on rather than responding to a developer coming to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| we thought it was unnecessary and, frankly, could possibly endanger the future of the project to go through the third party review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2378)|
| 0:39:46| I know the project is an exciting and important one because we are getting that kind of housing that's needed for seniors and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2386)|
| 0:39:52| But I didn't know why there wasn't a kind of an evaluation of that, whether that was a fair return, excessive return, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2392)|
| 0:39:59| It was an internal evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| Item 12A is an ordinance to amend the Knox City Code Appendix B zoning regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| Article 5, Section 20, Article 5, Section 5, 32 zoning districts within Article 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2414)|
| 0:40:21| and rescinding the adoption of the wireless communication facilities planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| Counsel, we have one person signed up to speak against this, Jacob Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| Are you here, Mr. Gibson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| Hello, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| Please state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| Well, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| To the Mayor and the members of the Council, I'm Matt Harris here actually on behalf of Mr. Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2444)|
| 0:40:58| I represent Verizon Wireless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| I'm sorry, state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| No, I'm sorry, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| Matt Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| My address is 211 Commerce Street, Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| And we have your letter, right, in the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| We have your letter on this subject in the record, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| I did submit a letter and don't intend to rehash all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| I did want just a few minutes to reiterate those points, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2482)|
| 0:41:30| and be able to answer questions should the Mayor or should the Council have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| As I said, I'm here on behalf of Verizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| We have been the predominant carrier engaged with planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| through the development of this amendment to the cell tower ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| We've been very appreciative of those interactions with Mr. Archer and his staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2507)|
| 0:41:54| and made a great deal of progress working toward a more balanced and effective ordinance for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2514)|
| 0:42:02| On behalf of Verizon, we still feel like there are areas of improvement available for this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2522)|
| 0:42:12| They're highlighted in my letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| Briefly, the amendment limits towers to two types of towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2537)|
| 0:42:26| They omit to allow a lattice or a guide type of tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| which would be the tower type for any tower approved over 200 feet typically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2550)|
| 0:42:38| We don't feel like it would compromise the ability of the city to regulate responsibly cell tower placement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2558)|
| 0:42:45| to allow for tower types that are typically associated with taller towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| when those are properly approved by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| Our second point deals with setback requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| There's a general setback requirement for properties in the zoning districts that I note in my letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2578)|
| 0:43:05| equal to 110% of the tower height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| As I point out in my letter, the ordinance fails to recognize current structural technology of these facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2589)|
| 0:43:18| which with respect to monopole types can be designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| and are typically designed if in the unlikely event there is a structural failure for the tower to essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2603)|
| 0:43:32| fold down onto itself rather than to follow the entire length of the tower height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2612)|
| 0:43:40| We feel like granting the planning staff the discretion to accept a certification from a structural engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| that a tower is designed, should it fail, to fail in that manner would grant more flexibility to needed tower placement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2627)|
| 0:43:59| to serve customers of not only Verizon but other carriers in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2639)|
| 0:44:06| Our third item briefly is a limit on tower heights of 125 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2646)|
| 0:44:13| even when towers are in industrial, commercial, or office zoning districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| if they happen to be within 200 feet of a residentially zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| We would respectfully submit that a tower in a more intense industrial or commercial office area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2663)|
| 0:44:33| should not be so limited notwithstanding the fact that it may be adjoining a residentially zoned area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2673)|
| 0:44:43| I have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| Yes, in conclusion, we would just ask that there are caps on tower heights that can be waived off by planning commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2684)|
| 0:44:58| We would ask that as long as tower heights meet setback requirements and other applicable bulk standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2698)|
| 0:45:07| that there not be an artificial cap on their height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| These are four ways in which we think the ordinance can be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| We would ask that the council defer any further sort of action on this bill to send it back to staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2716)|
| 0:45:26| to allow the industry to please continue to work with staff on these points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| Councilman Delavan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| I was going to ask Gerald Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| Gerald, the one that caught my attention the most, I think, in that grouping was the idea of the sort of, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2737)|
| 0:45:45| self-cascading tower like a ladder that's lowering down rather than tipping over and dropping towards a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2745)|
| 0:45:53| Is there any reason not to have some discretion to review an engineering proposal that you find acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| that would allow a lesser, I guess it's a setback for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| That's the one that caught my attention the most, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| Gerald Green, MPC Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| There was quite a bit of discussion regarding this at staff level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| Our concerns were not only with the potential for the tower to fall on the adjacent property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2774)|
| 0:46:22| but also some of the visual impacts, just what we've heard when towers are proposed in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2782)|
| 0:46:29| The major issues are setbacks in tower heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| The height seems, yeah, I agree with your height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| That setback is designed not only to assure that the adjacent properties are not harmed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2796)|
| 0:46:42| but also that there's some buffer and some visual separation that would lessen the aesthetic impact of the tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2802)|
| 0:46:50| So it's safety plus buffer that is the motivation for your approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| Well, thank you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| With regard to tower heights, I thought one of your main objectives was to start moving towards smaller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| distributed cellular devices that would avoid these monstrous things dominating the landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2823)|
| 0:47:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| We realize that there's a tradeoff that as towers get shorter, there might be the need for more facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2831)|
| 0:47:19| But again, in hearing the comments that we've received when towers are proposed, the height is a major issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2839)|
| 0:47:27| With this ordinance, we're allowing taller towers in the more intense districts, the industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| and reducing the tower height as the intensity of the zoning districts goes down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| trying to encourage taller towers and more facilities in those areas that have less impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2858)|
| 0:47:44| And that height restriction is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| Also, with the height above 200 feet, there is a requirement for lighting and FAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2866)|
| 0:47:53| The FAA, yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| Again, trying to lessen the impact of towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| We're trying to keep the height below that that would require lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| So you're fighting aesthetics as well as practical considerations in terms of these proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2882)|
| 0:48:09| What about the, I guess I should ask the last question, which was he talked about lattice towers with guy wires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| which I assume are a little less attractive and harder to make stealth looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| but what was the reasoning why we don't allow that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| Those two reasons, the aesthetics, the amount of land area required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2904)|
| 0:48:31| The guys go out at some distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| As Mr. Gibson pointed out, I believe in his letter, typically those lattice towers are over 200 feet in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2913)|
| 0:48:40| Our limits, unless the Planning Commission provides for an exception, is 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| So we did not see the real need for a lattice tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| In looking at our history, I can't remember when the last lattice tower was constructed in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2929)|
| 0:48:57| or Knox County, but it's been some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| The industry seems to be moving towards the monopole and the stealth and even the slick stick, the Type I tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2940)|
| 0:49:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| So we're trying to accommodate growth, but in a way that's least impactive to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2950)|
| 0:49:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| We don't want the city to be sued again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| Well, not on this anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| I think there's a good probability that this particular subject and a lot of other detail is going to be taken up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2969)|
| 0:49:40| perhaps in the General Assembly in Nashville, an upcoming session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| and the very high probability that I'll be real involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| I think I'm going to recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| I think it's just fair that I not take a position on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| Gerald, I appreciate you trying to strike the right balance for setbacks in height that we argued about quite a bit a few months back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=2996)|
| 0:50:08| In this case, as before, if I understand it right, I mean, he could appeal it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| If he could present a hardship case of why he needed a 200-foot tower, then he could appeal it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| It could come back to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| I mean, there is an avenue in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| He's asking for us to give you the authority to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| but I mean that could come back to Council if he could present the case, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| So that's kind of in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| He's asking for, if I understand it right, for it to remain at MPC if it were a case, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3031)|
| 0:50:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| So we have a motion and a second to approve 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3043)|
| 0:50:49| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3049)|

| 0:52:03| Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| Yeah, Gerald, as long as we got you tonight, I thought I'd put you to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| On C6, it sounds like one of the justifications is it gives you an opportunity for sort of a second shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3128)|
| 0:52:16| the administrative plan review and approval by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| Just tell us a little bit about C6 because it's an unusual zone we don't use very often, at least up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| You might use it a lot, Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| We don't use it a lot either, so I'm going to give a pretty quick overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| Wing it, Forbes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| It does require plan approval by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| It provides some range of uses that are not permitted in other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| It provides for office and some even light industrial uses in that zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| But, again, plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| Do you know the actual use that's being proposed or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| I think this is an auto sales dealership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| This property, both these properties, one of them is actually used by the auto dealership now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3178)|
| 0:53:05| The one on EF is an isolated property in terms of it's a single property zone for residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3185)|
| 0:53:13| surrounded by non-residential zoning that would allow for the expansion of the auto dealership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| It's just four-tenths of an acre, so he's kind of stretching out a little bit his business site, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171010?start=3206)|
