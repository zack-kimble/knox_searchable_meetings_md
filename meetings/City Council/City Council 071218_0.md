| 0:02:13| We're seeing a full coalition of council members and one Santa Claus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=133)|
| 0:02:22| Is there a motion to approve the minutes from our December 4th meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=142)|
| 0:02:26| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=146)|

| 0:02:29| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=151)|

| 0:02:35| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| Mayor, Item 9A is marked on the agenda as a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| It's a motion and a second to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| I think two weeks until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| It'll actually be two weeks and one day until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| I should have deferred to Mrs. Peele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| I didn't realize this was in her district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| No, I just couldn't hear you, but it is in my district and that was also my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| Two weeks and one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=182)|

| 0:03:07| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=188)|

| 0:03:10| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| Any other items to deal with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| At all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| I actually only have a couple of items for the mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| First is just what we just said, just a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| Our next council meeting will be a day off because it's slated to fall on the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| So, we'll be meeting January 2nd in these same chambers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| And I think my second item I have, we have some visitors here that I think I'm going to call down that want to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=217)|
| 0:03:44| special presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=224)|
| 0:03:56| You're welcome to come up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| Let me see if we have a handheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| We have a handheld mic you can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| If you'll just hang on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| So, our folks watching at home on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| We're greeting some representatives of the Volunteer Ministry Center, and I'm going to let them talk about why they're here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=246)|
| 0:04:13| real quick for a very special occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=253)|
| 0:04:24| I think that would work just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| And that would be on the TV level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| Oh, oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| Just front and center, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=272)|
| 0:04:38| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| Thank you so much for this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| I'm Ginny Weatherstone with the Volunteer Ministry Center, and we're here to see if we can embarrass a couple of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| I want to, first of all, share with you very, very briefly something that happened about ten years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=287)|
| 0:04:54| And this is when a gentleman who was on our board of directors at the time by the name of Brooks Lehman called me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=294)|
| 0:05:01| and told me that he had somebody that he wanted me to meet and could we have lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| It was Dr. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| And we went to the Regus, and Dr. Pelo explained to me that he was a regular with one of the meal groups that comes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=308)|
| 0:05:16| and serves homeless folks at the Volunteer Ministry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| And Dr. Pelo said that he was tired of watching people come through the line saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| I can't have anything hot or I can't have anything cold, and their mouth hurt, their teeth hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=326)|
| 0:05:32| And Dr. Pelo looked at me that day and said, I think I'm supposed to do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| Well, what I want to share with you is that he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| Nine years ago, Dr. Pelo and Mrs. Pelo and the members of their church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=342)|
| 0:05:48| which is Concord United Methodist, started the dental clinic at the Volunteer Ministry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| It would be absolutely impossible to tell you how many people have come through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| and received the services of the Pelos as they have come down and volunteered on Friday mornings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| They are about to retire from service at the Volunteer Ministry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| Now, I would hasten to add a little caveat to that, because I don't think it's going to be an absolute permanent retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=373)|
| 0:06:22| I think we will be able to call them when we need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| But it is time for us to take a moment and stop and recognize their service, and that's what we're here to do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=386)|
| 0:06:34| Bruce Spangler is here, who is the Chief Operating Officer of the Volunteer Ministry Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=394)|
| 0:06:41| and Peter Keyes, who is Chairman of the Board, and we have a small gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=401)|
| 0:06:48| And I just want to say that when they began, they occupied one tiny little room in our downtown headquarters at Jackson and Gay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=408)|
| 0:07:00| When we moved to our clinic and opened that up, they not only moved there, but they equipped the dental clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=420)|
| 0:07:09| Dr. Pelos is there every Friday when they're in town, which is most Fridays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| and Mrs. Pelos is there as his assistant and also staffs the front desk, and their daughter has worked as an assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=434)|
| 0:07:24| So the whole Pelos family has been faithful to us for nine years, and we are very grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=444)|
| 0:07:34| So on behalf of the Volunteer Ministry Center, and most importantly of all the neighbors that you have served through the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=454)|
| 0:07:42| in grateful appreciation to Dr. Ruben Pelos and Barbara Pelos for the founding of the dental clinic at the People's Clinic of the Volunteer Ministry Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=462)|
| 0:07:53| and for their selfless leadership and service in sustaining that clinic for the past nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=473)|
| 0:08:01| Through their efforts, countless homeless individuals have found their pain alleviated and have had the doorway open to a better life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=481)|
| 0:08:09| We present you this plaque as a sign of appreciation and love on this 18th day of December 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=489)|
| 0:08:31| I'm just going to say that we are the ones who have been so blessed to work with these folks, who every day are working to take care of so many needy people who are so grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=511)|
| 0:08:49| And it has just really enriched our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| So we should be giving you a gift for allowing us this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| Truly, that's from the heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| I can echo the words of my wife, and I appreciate so much your recognition of what we've been attempting to do down there for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=542)|
| 0:09:10| It's been my pleasure to be doing that, and I feel like that we are just dipping the ocean with a spoon when we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=550)|
| 0:09:19| But I've tried to give it my all, and I think that it's been good for a lot of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=559)|
| 0:09:26| And I just hope that what we've started can be continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| And I'm sort of, since there's TV here, I might say I call on my colleagues out there to maybe come down and talk with you folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=570)|
| 0:09:39| and maybe continue what we've done on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| But it does take commitment, and it's one that I can't leave totally, but we're going to have to step back for a short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=583)|
| 0:09:51| And we're ever so grateful for your recognition, for this beautiful plaque.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| And thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| And thank you, Mayor Haslund and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| I appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| I think it speaks volumes about people when they take their day off to do for free what they've been being paid to work to do all week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| And when you take your day off and go do that for free, for not every now and then, but for nine years every Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| I think that says about everything you can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| So thank you on behalf of the City of Knoxville as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| I'm going to move to reports of Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| I saw Councilman Becker's light first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| I wanted to follow up in a very related issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| On December 7th, we did the annual Project Homeless Connect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| which was a major gathering to try and provide some services to homeless folks in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| There were just some numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| 895 homeless people who registered, and there were a lot more that actually showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| I was working the door, and I think I let in some people I wasn't supposed to, but, you know, it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| Four people got housed directly out of that, which is a significant accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| And then there were another 102 that got on the track for housing as well that hadn't been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=665)|
| 0:11:12| 200 court cases heard by judges, which actually ends up being a major hindrance for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| They can't get a license because they've got a court case and try and deal with all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| Interestingly, just Dr. Pilo talked about the work you're doing being a dip in the ocean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| Remote Area Medical was there that day and saw 526 patients in that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| 122 dental appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| So clearly, for as good work as you do, there's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| And add about 20 over at the VFC to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| Well, 20 every Friday that you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| I mean, we were open that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| And then the final number is just 136 folks who got eyeglasses and eye exams that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| So a pretty significant step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| A lot of volunteers, and I think some really good work by some city people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| Proud to be involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| It's a great program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| Michael Dunthorne from our 10-year plan, 10 Chronic Homelessness, had that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| And he's actually become kind of a nationwide authority on Homeless Connect, Project Connect Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| So thanks for bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| One's a very, very positive thing, and the other maybe is something I want to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| But first, let me start out by congratulating one of our own, Councilman Rob Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| who was part of a feature in a local business magazine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| I don't know if you've seen it lately, but it had an article about 40 leaders in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| 40 years of age and under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| And Councilman Frost was recognized, and we applaud you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| They were desperate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Well-deserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| Well-deserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| We applaud you for being under 40 at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| And it was good to see him recognized there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| I think it was just and proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Congratulations to you, sir, on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| On another note, and I want to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| I know the city is having discussions with KUB about the lateral program and the sewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=779)|
| 0:13:06| replacement program that is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| But, you know, I must chime in and say that it is my sincere hope that we get some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| these issues addressed very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| I've talked to Mr. King, talked to the mayor about this, spoke to an individual who called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| me today on behalf of KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| You know, I've traveled the streets in my district, and I don't want to speak for anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| else in their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| But some of the subcontracting work that is being done is really failing our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| You know, I've got major problems in my district on a lot of streets with regards to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| some of these potholes are falling in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| We've got some major problems and damages that are being done to vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| Now the winter is setting in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| I'm very concerned that these subcontractors may not be able to come back or may not come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| back and deal with this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| So it's my hope that KUB gets with you, Mr. King, gets with the city very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| And I understand maybe within the next couple of weeks they're going to get together to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| Because while people talk sometimes about, well, it's going to make them go for rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| payers, those rate payers are also taxpayers, and they're paying for these cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| We do an awful lot about paving in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| We've just approved some sidewalks and some alleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| Last time, you know, the mayor put more money into paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| You know, there's a couple of streets I can think of in my district that were paved a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Now they're cut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| And, you know, before they come back around in the 20- to 30-year cycle to be repaved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| again, what's going to happen with those streets and for those individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| So we need to come up with a better way of filling those holes and filling those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| that are worked on and also hopefully a better way of addressing those streets where there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| are a lot of cut-ins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| In my community, there are a lot of older neighborhoods, a lot of older homes that needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| And I've gone down, I remember one street in particular, it seems like almost every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| house had to have a lateral cut-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| Now, while the individual's responsible for what happens in their yard to their house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| you know, what was going on in the street, KUB was doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| I mean, every house there was a cut-in coming to this street, and that street should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| You know, so, and I know subcontractors are doing the work for KUB, but my hope is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| Mr. King, that you guys will meet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| And hopefully, Memphis is going to be talking to you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| And I'd love to sit in on those meetings, but it's a big concern, and it's really going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| to be a problem as we continue to go in other parts of our community, because I've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| lot of older neighborhoods in my district, and I'm beginning to see this problem in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| of the ones they've already gone into right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| And we need to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| I started my morning meeting with some folks in my neighborhood about KUB doing exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| This was a street that had been torn up for four to six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| And I think it's interesting, Vice Mayor Brown, you talked about subcontractors being sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| of sloppy, that it was just sloppy work going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| And I want to encourage Mr. King and the mayor to move forward, that I think we do owe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| to the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| Ms. Pino, is this on the same issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| Well, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| And it just occurs to me that we went through some of that about a year ago in some of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| neighborhoods and on some major roads where we had some really dangerous issues where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| cuts were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| And, you know, the fill was made, but the pavement sank, and we had some really dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| KUB responded quickly, and we were able to mediate some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| But this is on the other side of the coin, and there's always the flip side of the coin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| I had a conversation this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| It also involved KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| And it involved something that about a year ago, a lot of us were kind of dancing a real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=990)|
| 0:16:37| jig over, and that had to do with tree cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| And we had a lot of conversation about that, and Council spent a great deal of time about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| And so I want to say that I just really feel positive about KUB responding to this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1006)|
| 0:16:53| because they have responded so remarkably to the tree cutting issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| And I have met with people, have actually a new office of communications with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1018)|
| 0:17:06| where people can contact them and get better information and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| And we were just discussing this morning how very incredibly amazing it is when a few people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| get very interested and very concerned, and they are persistent enough to continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| And we give KUB an opportunity to respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| They responded beautifully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| And I have to mention Larry Silverstein because I don't think he's totally happy with how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| But Larry was really, he was really instrumental in causing the rest of us to become concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1052)|
| 0:17:39| and interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| And someone said today, I don't know that he realized he's the champion that he is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| but it really woke us all up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| KUB has a totally new, they have a totally new policy toward tree cutting and toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| how they deal with those individuals who are going to experience that in their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| And I just want to applaud them for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| And that's the reason, Vice Mayor Brown and Councilman Becker, I feel that they are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| to be equally as committed to working with neighborhoods that are having this issue with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| the cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| Along the lines of what's previously been said, some folks in Aliceville-Springhill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| area, namely Hugh Noe, which many of you all know, contacted me with street problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| And I do have to compliment Bill Elmore at KUB for being responsive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| Changing the subject now, for the folks who particularly have young children or like Christmas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| light displays out in the Fountain City Inskip area of town on Thrush Drive, there's a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1117)|
| 0:18:44| that has some synchronized lights that's gotten a lot of attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| And for a good way, I don't know the exact street address, but it's johnsonchristmas.com| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1129)|
| 0:18:56| and you can find the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| And the family also has a house in the Aliceville-Springhill area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1138)|
| 0:19:05| They've got about a 40-foot tree with synchronized lights on it that's very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| Will this be covered by Mr. Becker's moratorium he's proposing later on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| Do you have something else on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| I just wanted to say, as you all talk with KUB, if I could be kept in the information loop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| it's a big concern in my district and I'm holding out and trying to be very positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| as Councilwoman Pelo is and I hope to get the same kind of great treatment that she's gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| with her response on some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| I've got some folks that are very concerned and very upset in my community and I think rightfully so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| I'll just make one brief comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| I think, obviously, KUB is having to do massive amounts of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| particularly in some neighborhoods that have older sewer lines and older developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| I don't think they're real happy with some of what's happened so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| We're trying to look at a different approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| We've been having some ongoing discussions so that we can get more streets totally repaved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1198)|

| 0:23:22| John Hancock, 8935 Childress Road, Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| I have a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| That'd be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| You might just pass it, and we'll pass it around so you can go ahead back to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| There isn't enough room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1416)|
| 0:23:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| What that shows, we had a meeting with Mr. Frost, Mr. Collins, and a few of the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1425)|
| 0:23:53| and their main concern for the duplex was that they did not want duplexes in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1433)|
| 0:24:01| That was their main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| As you know, MPC has their staff recommended approval of this use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1444)|
| 0:24:11| I have a final plat that will be signed tomorrow and filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| giving me the subdividing, the property, and giving me the easement that I need to get to the back property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1457)|
| 0:24:27| But what I did, I did a little research as much as I could with KGIS to locate the duplexes in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1467)|
| 0:24:36| If you look at the little map, the X, that, of course, marks 4104 Valley View Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1476)|
| 0:24:43| That's my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| You notice Washington Pike is 3,100 feet down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| I'd like for you to notice number one, number one down in the bottom right corner, that's the corner of Alice Bell and Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1491)|
| 0:24:59| There's a fourplex sitting right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| That's 3,100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| That's the same distance from Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| Number two on that map, that's 2705 Alice Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| That's a duplex also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| Number three is 2701.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| That's also a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| If you look at number four, that's off the map, that is 30, that address is 3807 and 3809, which is also a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1517)|
| 0:25:28| You're aware of the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| Right behind the golf course to the lower right corner, looking at this map, there's ten duplexes located right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1531)|
| 0:25:40| That's 4,800 feet from Valley View Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| If you go down, if you drive toward Knoxville, I think that's west on Valley View, go 3,800 feet and there's three duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1544)|
| 0:25:59| At 4,200, I'm not exactly sure of the road name, but there is another group of apartments right next to the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1559)|
| 0:26:17| Also, I'd like to add that 2,000 feet away from Valley View Drive, 4104, there's a zoning RP1, which is one to six units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1577)|
| 0:26:28| As you know, there's condos within 500 feet of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| There's condos with over 100 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| And back on Washington Pike, there's also an apartment complex with over 100 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1596)|
| 0:26:43| And I really, that's, I mean, that's the proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| You know, they say they don't want duplexes, but they're already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| Like I said, and they also said that renters, I quote that renters don't take care of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1612)|
| 0:26:59| The fact of the matter is it's not their property, it's my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1619)|
| 0:27:05| And if any of you rent, you know that if somebody's not taking care of your stuff, then you don't let that go on because that's your investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1625)|
| 0:27:17| I just, I really don't see any reason for denial of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| You know, it's perfectly legitimate to put back there considering the surroundings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1643)|
| 0:27:30| That's all I have to say. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| Glynda Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| Glynda Sharp, if you'd give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| I'm Louise McCrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| You can go, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| I'm Louise McCrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| I live at 3510 Bellevue Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| My property backs up to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| I'm a retired Knox County teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| I have taught in Aliceville Spring Hill community for over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| And to clarify his statement, Valley View's a long road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| The west end of Valley View is the lion's den, the golf course, the duplexes and apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1684)|
| 0:28:12| From fairway east in the Aliceville community is condos and homeowners, to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1692)|
| 0:28:22| The right-of-way is in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| It goes beside his house, and I have pictures that I'll pass around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| It's less than the required 25 foot, and it's a limited visibility to Valley View,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| so it's a dangerous place to come out onto for him and for the neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1716)|
| 0:28:45| A duplex at this place would not improve our property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| And from the picture that I'm going to show you, the property where he wants to put the duplex is surrounded by backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1730)|
| 0:28:58| It's in a low area that cannot be visible from any roadway, and it's a possibility for concerns back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1738)|
| 0:29:07| Thank you for your consideration in denying this request for the duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| And I do have a petition and pictures to show that I'll pass around with little notes for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| Ms. Sharpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| My name is Glenda Sharpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| I actually live at 907 Eagle Nest in Kodak, but I own the property at 4102 Valley View, which is next door to Mr. Hancock's property now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1763)|
| 0:29:35| I'm concerned for the traffic that would go in and out this access road that he proposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1775)|
| 0:29:43| It's quite close there between my property and this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| And although my property right now has no one in it, my aunt previously had lived there since the late 40s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1788)|
| 0:29:55| and plans on going back there if her health permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| The bedrooms are on that side where this access road would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| And going in and out, you never know what time of day or night people would have to go in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| You don't know what they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| You don't know how many visitors they'll have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| You don't know how many cars they'll have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| You don't know how loud the cars will be or what kind of music will come out the windows as they go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| So for that reason, I would ask that you deny this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| And I, too, do not feel that it's going to add value to our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| Even though our property is not new like he's proposing, I don't see that it will help the value of our property in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1833)|
| 0:30:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Mr. Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| I'm Ronnie Collins, 4606 Washington Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| I'm president of the Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| Mr. Hancock had the opportunity to contact and meet with neighbors in the Neighborhood Association before he went to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| and he did not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| He set up a meeting with Rob Frost that I was at, and he didn't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| When Mr. Frost contacted him, he seemed surprised that he showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| He set the meeting up and then he didn't even come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| So we both stood out there for 30 minutes waiting on him and he never showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1880)|
| 0:31:30| He needs a variance to be able to meet the subdivision requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| If he has to have a variance on the left side to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| he will not be able to leave trees on the left side as he said he would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| We believe in correct planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| We attend the one-year plan meetings, the general plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| We try to meet with all developers to hear and see what their plans are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| We support proper planning such as the other project you heard just a few minutes ago for some storage buildings on Love Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1913)|
| 0:32:01| We support proper planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| Since the first postponement, we met with Mr. Hancock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| He presented his plan for what he wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| He did not seem to comprehend our ideas or concerns of his project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| He seemed to only have his own ideas and plans and didn't seem to want to listen to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| If you'll note, the distances that he mentioned, almost all of them are almost a mile away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| He was over 3,000 feet in each one, in most of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| In some of them he's on Valley View and he talked about Alice Bell Road and Washington Park, which is not the same neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1952)|
| 0:32:40| I mean, it's the same community, but it's not the same vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| We don't feel this is a correct project for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| The surrounding properties are home-owned households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| Multiple rentals do not fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| We ask that you deny Mr. Hancock's appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| I appreciate all the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| It was really no skin off my nose that Mr. Hancock accidentally forgot the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| It's no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| That's why we postponed it the first time to allow the meeting, which we greatly appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| Tonight we're going to talk about creating a flagpole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| You know, that's what's coming with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| and this council has been faced with the creation of flagpole lots in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2001)|
| 0:33:30| While Mr. Hancock is certainly nice, I agree in my notes of what was said tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| He literally had to talk about in thousands of feet the next closest type of comparable multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2016)|
| 0:33:44| You have to go blocks and blocks to find something similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| And a little bit, as Mr. Collins said, Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association has a track record of supporting good zoning in the proper location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2029)|
| 0:33:59| This item 9C on the agenda, the new food city, the newly expanded Wal-Mart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| two different rezonings across from the East Town Home Depot, and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2046)|
| 0:34:14| There's a time and a place and a location for good things and good zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| Unfortunately, you know, looking at the totality of the circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| unfortunately, I don't think this is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| And, accordingly, I move to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| There's a motion and a second to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| Mr. Hancock has his hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| You could call on him if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| Yeah, you actually have two minutes to reply anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| So, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| I should have called on you at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| The city of Knoxville has already approved the 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| It's 24 feet, 3 inches, 7 inches shy of the 25-foot right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| They've already approved that for me, as of yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| But, you know, there's 5,300 and some feet in a mile, so they're just over a half a mile away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2102)|
| 0:35:10| And I'm not sure of his name, but the problem with one of the gentlemen at the thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| he said that you'd have to go further than Washington and Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| but as I gave you the measurements, it's exactly the same distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| You go either way, it's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| So that's, you know, not a very good argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| I can't remember all the rest of the points, but, you know, I don't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| I meet all the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| And, you know, the looks of the thing, there's a single-wide trailer behind the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2143)|
| 0:35:50| not even 500 yards away from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| I didn't think single-wide trailers were allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| but if there's a single-wide trailer right behind the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| there's probably multiple families living right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| And there's a house that's got the siding tore off of it about, what, 400 yards away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| I did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Anybody will say it, fixing up the house that was on the street that had been condemned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| because it was falling apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| And, you know, the property value is not going to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| because there's a duplex behind in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| They don't pull comps off of your next-door neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| They pull it off of comparable houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| So that's not a valid argument either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| But, you know, I'm at your mercy, as you can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| There is a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| Is there further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| Councilman Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| I didn't hear the end of Councilman Frost's basis for denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| Well, I was just saying, pulling my notes back out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| it's out of character with the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| If you look at Mr. Hancock's map, and I take it that he did do it correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| you have to go thousands of feet to find something similar to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| And just the general notion of it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| not the right thing at the right place at the right time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| Does this meet the code requirement for the one I asked Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2235)|
| 0:37:21| Does the driveway meet the code requirement for the duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| With the approval of the variance, it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| The code requires a minimum width of 25 feet for that flagpole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| He had 24.2 or 3, and as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| he has received a variance from the 25-foot requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| So he does have the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| As I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2267)|
| 0:37:54| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| Yeah, quick question again for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| The use on review is for the duplex, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| If he chose to build a single family house back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| he could potentially already be building, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| It would be a use by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| Mr. Donaldson, I'm curious why or how the variance was approved for the driveway width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| prior to the approval of the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| I think we acted on the use on review prior to the variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| and an applicant has the opportunity to apply for a variance at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| But I think we made our recommendation based on the contingency that the variance be obtained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| and as I understand it, he has obtained that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| And is that used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| And he would need that whether he builds a house on the lot or a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| I'll take it we're ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| The motion on the floor is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| All those in favor of the motion, which is denying, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| I heard one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| I heard eight ayes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| The motion, which was to deny, carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Fred D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| Tony Thompson, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| in the amount of $50,000 to provide governmental relations services for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| Two quick comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| Number one, Tony is here, drove over from Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| So, if anybody would like to address Tony in any way, he's more than glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| Secondly, just a quick update for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| I think a lot of you all know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| When Margie left, we moved the responsibility for this to Bill Lyon's Department in Policy and Communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| One, quite frankly, it's Bill's background being a political science professor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| He has a lot of knowledge of the legislative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| He also happens to have taught a few of those legislators at one time or another in his career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| And I think it just fits in with where we are as policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| So, I think that's why we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| Bill is well aware of the time involved there and is prepared to take that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| But I thought it was worth at least bringing that up to folks if you had any questions concerning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2408)|
| 0:40:14| Quite frankly, between Tony's representation, you have to be in Nashville some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| but we don't have to be there all that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| That's why we pay Tony this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| It's really more of a case of keeping abreast of all the issues that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| And I think you all get a copy of those now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| We forward those to you every time that comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| Keeping a top of those and making certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| And some of it, as I explained to some people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| is it's just a matter of being a traffic cop and getting the stuff that needs to go to legal or to me or to whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| So, that's kind of the role Bill will play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| I think we're comfortable with that going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| Questions for anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2457)|

| 0:41:35| I don't know if I need to say this, but I will point out that I serve on the Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2495)|

| 0:41:42| I have been in on a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| I think this is something that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| The county, I think, did the same thing, I think, yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| For reference, I'm the other city seat on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2515)|

| 0:42:23| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| 11E is a resolution respectfully requesting and encouraging the executive director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| and the professional staff of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| to review, study, and analyze the multiplicity of commercial zoning classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| currently contained in the Zoning Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| and to give serious consideration to modifying such classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| so as to improve the compatibility, performance, and appearance of commercial districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2561)|

| 0:42:48| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| Can I make, I want to make one brief comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| I didn't bring it up during the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| I know we have one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| I do want to say this, and I say it a little bit for Mark's benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| but MPC is like any other organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| They have a work schedule and a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| And the first year we come up and we all go to the budget meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| and talk about here's what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| So I think we shouldn't be oblivious to the fact that we can't just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| every time somebody on the Council says, well, I think we should study this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| and give it to them and they can absorb that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| It really does have to be part of a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| And, Mark, I don't know if you want to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| I'm not trying to fight your battles for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| but I think it's more why we need to have a strategic plan of what we ask MPC to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| I mean, it's easy for anybody to say, here, you do this work, you do this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| but they basically charge us for their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| and they budget that at the first year and come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| I realize we have to be flexible in that, but it's not a bottomless pit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| And I don't know, Mark, if you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| Well, I appreciate your comments, and I will join you in that battle side by side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| The R1E and work we've been accommodating within our regular work program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| we had planned on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| With Resolution 11E, we start to pile on a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| and it is a significant work task and work program to analyze all of our commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2648)|
| 0:44:16| If we were to do it quickly, we probably would do it poorly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| We will want to do a good job, and it may take a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| and it may even take rolling it into next year's work program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| That goes to the last resolution as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| which deals with form-based coding in the Vestal area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| Form-based coding usually comes on the tail end of a very thorough citizen-driven process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2679)|
| 0:44:48| with a lot of public input to characterize the DNA of a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| This is very labor-intensive, so we'll be probably looking to stretch that one out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2694)|
| 0:45:02| Ms. Pilo, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Well, probably it's after the fact, but I had some concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| which you have stated in your comments there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2708)|
| 0:45:14| because I feel that there's other neighborhoods who are going to be looking to the R1E studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2714)|
| 0:45:21| And that was one thing that crossed my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| We have already kind of gotten on that train, and we've added to your workload at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2723)|
| 0:45:31| And I would hate to see a neighborhood that was just about to make that determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| miss the opportunity to be able to get on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| And I was just concerned that we perhaps were overloading these good folks who do all this work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2742)|
| 0:45:50| If I could respond to that, the R1EN efforts, we're getting good at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2750)|
| 0:45:59| For example, the resolution that you just passed tonight asking us to look at a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| I was handed petitions with 140 of the 180 property owners signing off on it already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2765)|
| 0:46:14| So we've done a lot of groundwork out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| The neighborhoods are getting good at getting organized and getting block captains and going door to door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2778)|
| 0:46:26| It's getting to the point where I just have to show up, do my spiel, and turn it over to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2786)|
| 0:46:34| So that isn't a great effort, and we have probably initiated contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| with most of the likely neighborhoods in the city already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2799)|
| 0:46:45| That effort will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| We're going to be coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| We weren't able to get this on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| That's the street where Jack Sharp lives, the former mayor of Ice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2813)|
| 0:47:04| That wasn't meant to be a lecture as much as just this is reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| I think one of the things we all learn after being around a while is when we have these planning meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| they really are important, and we need to think through what are their priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| and realize we're going to leave them some flexibility room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| But like everything else, once we set a strategy, we can't just come piling on all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| I think this is actually, you know, a good thing to keep in mind when we're doing budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| When we actually have to deal with paying the piper and all this and how the priorities work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| And I'm glad you raised the issue because it is really easy to ask Mark to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| He just smiles and nods his head, and so far he's getting them done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| Well, and if I could, there are some things that result in only a tweak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| and adding a line to the zoning code, which, you know, we can accommodate that relatively easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2865)|

| 0:48:52| This has been a project that I've worked on for 30 years that I've lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| And this, I'm hoping, will be a great improvement that will keep my house from flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2937)|
| 0:49:03| and some of the other houses there have been flooding on the same side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2943)|

| 0:49:11| so I can roll it out and clean it out and put it back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2951)|

| 0:49:48| so folks are going to be gaining a little bit of the front yards back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| I think that's a great move on the part of the city to make that neighborhood even better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| and I want to thank the engineering department for what they're doing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=2996)|

| 0:54:35| What type of record would make someone unsuitable for one of these licenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| I note that the results of the background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| will be used to determine a person's suitability for getting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| What kind of things would kick someone out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| We have a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| If it was there, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| No, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| It's 26-114.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| And some of the things are DUI convictions within the past 12 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| a certain type of motor vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| if you have three speeding tickets within a certain amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| A motor vehicle offender would be included also, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| There's probably 10 things on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| 12C is an ordinance to amend Sections 26-302 and 26-410 of the Code of Ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| of the City of Knoxville so as to increase the permissible maximum charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| for storage fees for nonconsensual tows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| and to allow wrecker companies on the rotation list to start charging said fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| after 24 hours rather than current 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| Mr. Pruitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| Before we vote, can you give us a little explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| because I actually hear lots of complaints about folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| who feel like towing companies are taking advantage of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| and this feels like we're giving them more leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| Help us understand what's driving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| Several of the wrecker company owners came before the wrecker commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| and requested that they look at the storage fees compared to other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| And I did some research on Chattanooga, Nashville, and the Memphis areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| And our fees have not been changed, I believe, for like 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| And we were way, way below other cities such as Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3378)|
| 0:56:25| Theirs is $15, $35, and $35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| And ours were, our current fees were $13, $15, and $20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3388)|
| 0:56:36| So the wrecker commission met and recommended to bring it to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| that we raise the fees to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| Counsel, help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| This is only slightly related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| This is a question that I ran into and I talked to Chief Owen about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| And they were very helpful in getting a particular situation rectified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| But something that we may want to take a look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| not necessarily in the immediate future but somewhere down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| found out that when someone's a victim of a car theft and a car is recovered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| that they have to, if it's taken to the impound lot, a tow taken to the impound lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3431)|
| 0:57:18| and once it's delivered there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| normally I believe that they have to pay to get the car out of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| And when I found that out, I was disturbed by that because I thought, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| we're actually penalizing the victim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| And that just didn't seem right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| So I think that's something we, I'm just bringing that up in the context of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| I don't want to get into it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| But, you know, that's something that concerned me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| I think that's a valid concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| I don't know how we look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| And I don't know if it may delay getting the money back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| but that may be something that we could try to work with the DA's offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| making that a part of restitution if the person who has stolen the vehicle is caught,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| make it a part of their restitution in court maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| It's maybe something we can look at or put us in discretionary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| that the chief could exercise or something down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| Or maybe it's something that we could pick up as a city to just help the victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| It just seems to me that this is an issue that the record commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| but we might refer to them to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| Having been on the record commission a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| I feel that that's probably a good place to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| We are currently looking at that right now with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| and plan on bringing something to you in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3511)|
| 0:58:32| Thank you, Officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| Do we vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| I don't think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3519)|
| 0:58:40| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| 12D is an emergency ordinance adopting a temporary 90-day stopgap moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| upon the issuance of new permits for the erection of the electronic message centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| within the city of Knoxville pending a review and potential modification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| of zoning requirements regulating such signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| Requested by Councilmember Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| Councilmember Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| I'll go ahead and make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| Councilmember Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Yeah, just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| The MPC had their agenda review and talked about the digital billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| and a recommendation came down that they wanted to look at electronic message boards as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3555)|
| 0:59:21| Some concern raised there about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| does that mean we're going to get sort of a slew of applications before they change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| I was real pleased that even though it was technically after the deadline for getting things on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| we were able to get this on for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| Enough people have talked to me to say this is a good idea that I think is worth doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| but I guess that's the end of my speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| Ms. Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| I would just think in light of MPC's actions on Thursday of last week that probably this is in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3584)|
| 0:59:54| I don't know that it's a pressing need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| but I just think to keep everything kind of on a level playing field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| until some decisions are made there and recommendations come before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| it might be wise not to have anything just pop up that we have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3607)|
| 1:00:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Yeah, I think this is a question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| Just on the timing, we can always end it earlier or extend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| but is 90 days sort of in your brain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| does that feel like we're going to have some answers somewhere around that period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| During the discussion at Thursday's MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| we talked about bringing something back to them at their February meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| which would be 60 days from then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| And that would get back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3643)|

| 1:03:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3822)|
| 1:04:02| I'm Lois Simington, Director of the East Tennessee Technology Access Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| and I've come to thank all of you, in particular Council Member Woodhull, Becker, Frost, Hall, and Pelow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3846)|
| 1:04:18| and Vice Mayor Mark Brown for your support of Toy Tech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| The thank yous and the pictures of the children are on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| and the thank yous are from their parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| But I wonder how many of you know exactly what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| This is a toy that if a family member went and bought would cost about $12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| But a lot of children that we work with can't play with toys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| and so we take that toy and we adapt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3883)|
| 1:04:50| Actually, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| Volunteers in the community like at Boeing and B&W Clinch River and various electricians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3892)|
| 1:04:58| and people who just have a love of electronics and a knowledge of electronics and a love of children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3898)|
| 1:05:06| and they make it so that children can operate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3906)|
| 1:05:14| The current graduating class of Fountainhead College made these switches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| If a family bought this toy adapted, it would cost about $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| If they bought this switch, and some of you like me probably think of a switch as coming off a forsythia bush,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3923)|
| 1:05:31| but this is a switch, and this makes operation of that toy possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| for kids who can't use their hands to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| At our party that was held at the Central Baptist in Fountain City last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3941)|
| 1:05:48| we had a little boy there who was three years old who had never played with toys before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| He had never been able to hold it, touch it, or even make it go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| What you're doing is setting the seeds in place for a lot of future learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3959)|
| 1:06:06| We in our society are known for what we do for the least among us, and I want to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3966)|
| 1:06:13| So the thank you is from the parents and from the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| I'm not quite sure what you do with it from here, but I've delivered it, and I have the individual thank yous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| and I'd like to show you what happens to this toy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| Where is the Santa hat? We need the Santa hat back now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3987)|
| 1:06:34| She wants you to wear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| So what happens is a child will take an elbow or any muscle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=3998)|
| 1:06:57| What happens to this little boy who saw for the first time could play with a car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| and he actually picked out a truck, and the eyes flashed, and the nose beeped, and the wheels turned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=4023)|
| 1:07:10| and it was noisy and obnoxious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| And for the first time in this little boy's life, the daddy said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| Stop, you're getting on my nerves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| And that's wonderful, and that is absolutely a wonderful experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| So what you're doing is a lot beyond toys, and for that we thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| Lois, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| And on that encouraging note, we will end our last council meeting of the year of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| I want to thank you all for a great year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| I hope everybody has a great holiday period and look forward to seeing you back on January 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| Merry Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071218?start=4064)|
