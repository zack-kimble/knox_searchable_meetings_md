| 2:24:59| So it really doesn't matter because it would change by the time it gets there anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8699)|
| 2:25:07| Ms. Coney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8707)|
| 2:25:08| Just to note, if the board were to re-vote to ratify it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| I would assign it a new 2023 resolution number and repost it to the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8711)|
| 2:25:20| So would it be easier to do that with the new number next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8720)|
| 2:25:27| What is the rest of the board thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8727)|
| 2:25:32| Should we try to do this now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8732)|
| 2:25:33| Should we just go ahead and do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8733)|
| 2:25:36| Is everybody good with it as it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8736)|
| 2:25:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8738)|
| 2:25:39| So then I'll attempt to make two different motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8739)|
| 2:25:42| I think Ms. Fortin has something to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8742)|
| 2:25:44| Well, I was just going to say, I don't think the legislature is going to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8744)|
| 2:25:47| So, I mean, I think it's pointless basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8747)|
| 2:25:51| They're not going to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8751)|
| 2:25:52| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8752)|
| 2:25:55| I don't think it matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8757)|
| 2:26:01| However, they are also talking about doing the exact same thing with math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8761)|
| 2:26:07| So, you know, maybe it could have some influence there, even though it doesn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8767)|
| 2:26:15| You know, I don't want to go on and on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8775)|
| 2:26:19| So I'll make two different motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8779)|
| 2:26:23| So first, I'd make a motion to recommit to the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8783)|
| 2:26:32| Oops, sorry, I've got the wrong one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| The resolution of the board supporting our students and teachers by requesting the Tennessee General Assembly amend TCA 49-63-115| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8794)|
| 2:26:43| to allow school districts to make retention decisions for third and fourth grade students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8803)|
| 2:26:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| I have a motion on the floor by Ms. Owen to recommit to the resolution, which everybody has that right at their desk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8811)|
| 2:27:01| basically what that says at the top, supporting our students and teachers by requesting the Tennessee General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8821)|
| 2:27:07| to amend TCA 49-6-315 to allow school districts to make retention decisions for third and fourth grade students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8827)|
| 2:27:17| And a second by Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8837)|
| 2:27:20| So did you have anything else, Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8840)|
| 2:27:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8843)|
| 2:27:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8844)|
| 2:27:25| So any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| So all in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8849)|
| 2:27:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8850)|
| 2:27:31| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8851)|
| 2:27:33| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8853)|
| 2:27:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8854)|
| 2:27:35| And the second motion would be for this board to send our resolution supporting our students and teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8855)|
| 2:27:41| by requesting the Tennessee General Assembly amend TCA 49-63-115| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8861)|
| 2:27:46| to allow school districts to make retention decisions for third and fourth grade students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8866)|
| 2:27:50| to TSBA for consideration in their legislative priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8870)|
| 2:27:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8876)|
| 2:27:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8877)|
| 2:27:58| So we have a motion by Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8878)|
| 2:28:01| Do you want to reread that, Ms. Coney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| I wasn't taking notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8883)|
| 2:28:06| You talk faster than I can write.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| Ms. Owen, did you write all that down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| I don't think I captured it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8890)|
| 2:28:12| I took the title right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8892)|
| 2:28:15| And then save and give them to send that to TSBA, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8895)|
| 2:28:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8900)|
| 2:28:21| And we have a second by Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8907)|
| 2:28:28| So all in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8908)|
| 2:28:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8909)|

| 2:32:32| Congratulations, Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9152)|
| 2:32:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9156)|
| 2:32:37| So that is the last of this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9157)|
| 2:32:44| And we have a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9164)|
| 2:32:45| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9165)|
| 2:32:48| We have one public forum speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9168)|

| 2:32:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9174)|
| 2:32:55| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9175)|
| 2:32:56| Just state your name, which you just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9176)|
| 2:32:57| County of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9177)|
| 2:33:00| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9180)|
| 2:33:01| My name is Dr. Robbie Poteet, and I'm a Knox County resident and music educator at A.L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9181)|
| 2:33:04| Watts Elementary School in Region 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9184)|
| 2:33:06| This evening, I'm here to advocate for my students and my fellow colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9186)|
| 2:33:10| Watts is a great school, but to use a cliche, we are bursting at the seams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9190)|
| 2:33:14| I'm here to challenge you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9194)|
| 2:33:15| In fact, an apartment complex zoned to our school will be fully open by the end of 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9195)|
| 2:33:20| and I stand here to advocate for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9200)|
| 2:33:22| First, our space, and second, for additionally highly needed staff in the related arts area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9202)|
| 2:33:27| For this school year, a new portable was installed and earmarked for my music classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9207)|
| 2:33:31| This space was repurposed and now has to be used for general classroom use because we are, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9211)|
| 2:33:35| bursting at the seams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9215)|
| 2:33:36| Yes, there are rules to class size mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9216)|
| 2:33:39| In the past few years, we've had two art rooms and one music room with one staff member on a card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9219)|
| 2:33:44| and we finally thought we had a space for two music rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9224)|
| 2:33:47| This is now not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9227)|
| 2:33:49| Not only over the summer, due to enrollment, did we lose the new portable for music,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9229)|
| 2:33:53| we have lost our second art room as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| We now have one art room and one music room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9235)|
| 2:33:57| Rather than teach on a card, art and music educators have used our creative side to develop ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9237)|
| 2:34:01| and ways to teach two classes in those rooms at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9241)|
| 2:34:04| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9244)|
| 2:34:05| Because we believe that students should have equitable access to all materials for each lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9245)|
| 2:34:10| Trust me, I've taught on a cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9250)|
| 2:34:11| For example, instead of being able to use a full set of orthophones in class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9251)|
| 2:34:15| I can only take maybe one or two on a good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9255)|
| 2:34:18| The other classes in the music room, while I was on a cart, had full access to these materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9258)|
| 2:34:22| Imagine tracking all the necessary art supplies as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9262)|
| 2:34:25| You can only take so much with you, and plus, things get damaged in transport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9265)|
| 2:34:29| Our classes are huge, doubled up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9269)|
| 2:34:31| but we are doing this to give our students access to materials at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9271)|
| 2:34:34| Large class sizes lead to my second advocation point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9274)|
| 2:34:37| At Lotz, we are in high need for an eighth related arts position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9277)|
| 2:34:41| We're on a seven-day rotation, meaning seven related arts teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9281)|
| 2:34:44| Each day, we have to split an eighth classroom amongst the already seven related arts classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9284)|
| 2:34:49| This has created even larger classes for related arts every day, K-5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9289)|
| 2:34:53| and don't forget, we're doubling up to give our students equitable access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9293)|
| 2:34:56| Also, the seven-day rotation is creating a headache in trying to plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9296)|
| 2:35:00| The seven-day rotation creates a day where you have seen a class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9300)|
| 2:35:04| and then shortly thereafter, see them again with a class that has not had the same lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9304)|
| 2:35:09| And this happens more than once in the seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9309)|
| 2:35:12| Trust me, it is a headache to plan for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9312)|
| 2:35:15| An eighth person would be a quick fix for now to alleviate some of the larger class sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9315)|
| 2:35:20| and the crazy planning that we must do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9320)|
| 2:35:22| Again, I am not here to complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9322)|
| 2:35:24| I'm simply here to advocate for my students and my fellow colleagues at Lotz| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9324)|
| 2:35:28| and other schools who are in need for more space, and we need more staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9328)|
| 2:35:32| Lotz is not the only school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9332)|
| 2:35:34| Proactive instead of reactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9334)|
| 2:35:36| As we've heard tonight, boots on the ground, being collective, and helping our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9336)|
| 2:35:41| And we need a solid plan for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9341)|
| 2:35:43| Our county leaders, our city leaders, and all of you and our school leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9343)|
| 2:35:47| So when you see the requests for more space or additional staff, we need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9347)|
| 2:35:51| So please consider these needs and make them our priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9351)|
| 2:35:54| and please consider how vital the arts are for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9354)|
| 2:35:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9357)|
| 2:36:00| Madam Chair, can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9360)|
| 2:36:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9362)|
| 2:36:03| Dr. Poteet, I just have a very quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9363)|
| 2:36:07| Are you in a music classroom-sized classroom or in a regular gen ed classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9367)|
| 2:36:13| We are in a music classroom, and luckily our room is very large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9373)|
| 2:36:17| It is fire-coated for 60 students, and we are starting to push that limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9377)|
| 2:36:23| because we're picking up more and more students every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9383)|
| 2:36:26| Especially in fifth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9386)|
| 2:36:27| Some of our classes are smaller, but we're, with me and my fellow colleague teaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9387)|
| 2:36:32| and then the kids coming in with a split class plus our two classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9392)|
| 2:36:35| we're pushing getting close to 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9395)|
| 2:36:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9397)|
| 2:36:38| I've done that, and it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9398)|
| 2:36:39| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9399)|
| 2:36:40| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9400)|
| 2:36:41| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9401)|
| 2:36:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9402)|
| 2:36:43| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9403)|
| 2:36:44| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9404)|
| 2:36:45| As somebody who represents the Hardin Valley area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9405)|
| 2:36:47| I completely sympathize with everything you just said, and you're completely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9407)|
| 2:36:52| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9412)|
| 2:36:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9415)|
| 2:36:56| Meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=9416)|
