| 0:00:29| Welcome to the Board of Education's April 3rd, 2023 Work Session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=29)|
| 0:00:37| Mr. Triplett will be doing our Pledge of Allegiance today, and I believe he will lead with a prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=37)|
| 0:00:45| Is that right, Mr. Triplett, as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=45)|
| 0:00:48| Let's go ahead and stand. I just thought in light of the events in Nashville this past week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=48)|
| 0:00:53| rather than a traditional moment of silence, I'd like to just say a word of prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=53)|
| 0:00:58| Let's pray. Father, we love you, and we are all brokenhearted at the loss of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=58)|
| 0:01:04| at Covenant School in Nashville this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=64)|
| 0:01:07| Father, we're comforted by your words, which tells us in Psalms that you're near to the brokenhearted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=67)|
| 0:01:13| Father, we ask you to be near to these brokenhearted families and friends who have lost loved ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=73)|
| 0:01:19| We ask you to be near to these brokenhearted parents who this week have had to bury their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=79)|
| 0:01:25| We ask, Father, that you would provide the comfort that these families need and that only you can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=85)|
| 0:01:32| I pray for these students and these teachers who have witnessed something that no one should ever have to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=92)|
| 0:01:39| and experienced something no one should ever have to experience, that in all the emotion and worry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=99)|
| 0:01:45| and anxiety and fear, Father, that you would replace that fear with peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=105)|
| 0:01:49| You'd replace that anxiety and worry with hope and trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=109)|
| 0:01:54| I pray that as they begin the process in the days, weeks, months, and really even years ahead of coping with what they've had to be a part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=114)|
| 0:02:01| I pray, Father, they would not allow this to destroy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| I pray, Father, that even in their deepest and darkest days, they would know the love of a heavenly Father who cares,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=125)|
| 0:02:13| who's there, and can help them rise up and walk through this valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| I pray that we would all find our hope in you and in the salvation offered through your Son, Jesus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| In his name we pray, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| Let's face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=152)|
| 0:02:49| Thank you, Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| A few announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| Ms. Horne will not be in attendance tonight due to business travel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| and I believe Mr. McMillan is running late but will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| In addition to regular monthly meetings, during April, the board will hold a called meeting on Thursday, April 27th at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=183)|
| 0:03:10| to consider the annual budget, and that meeting will be held in this boardroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| Also, just a reminder tonight, I know we have a lot of people signed up for public forum and a lengthy agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=195)|
| 0:03:24| I just want to remind everyone in attendance that this is the only opportunity that we as a board have to discuss issues that come before us as an elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=204)|
| 0:03:35| We're glad that you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| We do ask that we keep the noise down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=217)|
| 0:03:43| If you need to say something or talk to your neighbor, please step outside to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| Please refrain from cheering, clapping, booing, snapping, hissing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=228)|
| 0:03:56| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| What am I missing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| All those things because we do have a lengthy agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| Just to set that expectation, if this does happen, I will ask whoever is speaking to stop, and we will ask you to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=244)|
| 0:04:14| We really don't want to ask anybody to leave tonight, so if we can just all be respectful of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| Also, board members, if you will make sure to pull your microphone down and speak clearly into that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=260)|
| 0:04:28| because I know it's difficult for us to hear when people are talking out there, but it's also sometimes difficult for people out there to hear us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=268)|
| 0:04:36| especially if we're not speaking directly in our microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| So I do ask that you speak clearly in your microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| So with all of that, are there any requested changes to this meeting agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=285)|
| 0:04:53| Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| So a motion by Mr. Triplett, a second by Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| Superintendent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| I just want to start by saying it's been a very tough week, and thank you to the board and for Mr. Triplett for recognizing the events from Nashville earlier tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=315)|
| 0:05:26| I would also like to begin on behalf of Knox County School staff in expressing our district's condolences to the Covenant School in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=326)|
| 0:05:35| As I told our families, this event was shocking, and I know that it caused anxiety and concern in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| especially our students who have suffered from these kinds of acts of violence or being involved in those before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| I want to emphasize that safety is our district's top priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| and I consult regularly with our security chief, Jason Perriard, who does a great job, and even working with our other law enforcement agencies that are great partners of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=350)|
| 0:05:59| From day one, I've charged our security department to work with our law enforcement partners to continuously monitor and enhance our safety plans that we have for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=359)|
| 0:06:09| We will continue to be proactive in protecting our students and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| While it was a tough week in Nashville, here at home we also have been dealing with some significant issues of our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| I want to apologize for the length of tonight's update, but I have some serious topics that I want to up-to-date the board and also the families in public tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=379)|
| 0:06:28| Under my leadership, Knox County Schools will not stop focusing on what students need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| Our students are counting on us to lead, and therefore we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| With that said, I want to begin by addressing a situation that took place last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| when a contracted employee intentionally left a gas valve open at Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| I want to thank the Knox County Sheriff's Office for their quick response to the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| I want to thank the staff at Hardin Valley Academy for their work to safely evacuate the students from the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| And also, I want to announce tonight that with that in mind, I have asked our assistant superintendent of business and talent, Ms. Jennifer Himmelgarn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=420)|
| 0:07:07| to conduct a formal review of the incident with two major areas of focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| The first will be to look at the actions taken by the school and district leaders in response to this incident last Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| and also to review the protocols and procedures that are in place to address similar situations should they arise again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=438)|
| 0:07:24| Ms. Himmelgarn will lead this interview and will have uninhibited access to any KCS personnel she needs to assist her in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=444)|
| 0:07:32| At the conclusion of this review, it is my directive that we have concrete ways to improve school safety and protocols district-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| And also, Ms. Himmelgarn will produce a report for the KCS Board of Education on that review as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=459)|
| 0:07:47| I also want to provide an update about our review of student success practices, policies, and procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| particularly those related to special education, response to intervention, 504, and ELL services and supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=473)|
| 0:08:00| We have conducted multiple surveys, and I want to provide some details about that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| The RTI, or response to intervention, survey opened on March the 21st, and as of Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| it received 389 responses from families who received those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| And we also translated those into Spanish, so we've gotten some responses as well from families who speak that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=494)|
| 0:08:22| The special education and 504 survey is currently open and has been shared with parents and guardians of all students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| currently identified for an IEP or a 504 plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| And the ELL survey is being translated into nine languages and will be shared with families opening on April the 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=511)|
| 0:08:38| In addition, the Knox Education Foundation has secured the Ackerman Marketing and PR firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| to facilitate a series of regional parent focus groups in early May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| We also intend to open an educator import portal in mid-April for special education teachers, teaching assistants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=529)|
| 0:08:57| and principals of special day schools to share innovative and strategic ideas to help us better meet the needs of our unique students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=537)|
| 0:09:05| I intend to appoint a special education task force in the coming weeks to process the inputs we receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| and to make concrete, meaningful recommendations to improve our work in the special education space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| This small working group will consist of parents and guardians of KCS students selected to represent a variety of special education perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=557)|
| 0:09:24| While I plan to ensure KCS educators have a voice at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| my intent is not to include any district-level personnel or board members in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| The task force will be responsible for presenting their final recommendations to the board in a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| so district personnel can work with the board to act on the recommendations that were given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=580)|
| 0:09:50| Finally, please know that as the superintendent, I'm committed to transparency and continuous improvement in all areas of our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| My hope is that we'll foster confidence among our stakeholders as we move forward with various challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| And finally, I want to remind everyone that Friday, April the 7th, and Monday, April the 10th, are student holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| We look forward to seeing students back in class on Tuesday, April the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| Madam Chair, that concludes my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| Thank you, Dr. Eisenhoek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| So next we have our annual plan quarterly progress report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=620)|
| 0:10:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| I have two, three questions, follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| For the custodian contract company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| is this something that may be considered to be looked at in their screening process since this was a contract worker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=641)|
| 0:10:52| Madam Chair, thank you, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| So they go through the same screening process that we do for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| I will say that they took swift action for that employee and any employee they have concerns with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=660)|
| 0:11:07| They no longer work for Knox County Schools, whether it's termination or they are reassigned to another organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| So I do know that they do have the same protocols and security screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| And also in that area, what is the status of the custodian worker shortage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=679)|
| 0:11:29| So currently we have 100 vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| And how does that relate to where we were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| Is that more or less about the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| It's about the same, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| And then the other something that wasn't mentioned but I know was mentioned in the news, and I've gotten calls about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=703)|
| 0:11:52| is that's a racial incident at one of our high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| And the concern was probably more of not understanding the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| They understand that the person was suspended with pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| And I'm not asking, I know it's a personnel issue so we can't talk about all the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| but at least talk about the process that the community should expect in a situation such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=731)|
| 0:12:18| Thank you, Mr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| I'll start making a comment and then I'll let Ms. Himmelgarn speak to some of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=739)|
| 0:12:25| So the incident did occur at one of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| When we were made aware of that, I want to first thank the administration of that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| They acted quickly to let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| I know our human resource department had people on the ground there pretty quick after we were made aware of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| and that person was removed and rightfully removed from our campus and has not been back to our campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=764)|
| 0:12:51| And so I'll let Ms. Himmelgarn kind of speak to how that process works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| but that is the first step that we have to take with due process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| and all the things that are laid out there is to put them on leave with pay to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| So I'll let Ms. Himmelgarn speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| Madam Chair, Reverend Butler, members of the board, yes, you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| We don't want to get too far into details about a specific employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| but like Dr. Reiswick said, our certified educators are entitled to due process under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| So removing an employee from a situation is the number one priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| and typically that is administrative leave with pay pending investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=811)|
| 0:13:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| I would like to circle back to the custodian kind of topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| and this question might be for Mr. Reiswick or Garfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| In pinging off of kind of like their training and procedure and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| it seems like a custodian that would be employed through KCS and not through Duncan & Sons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| would have more familiarity with the schools and facilities and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| and I'm curious what kind of system or training is put in place for the Duncan & Sons employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=846)|
| 0:14:13| that might not be familiar with schools and the facilities and classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=853)|
| 0:14:20| and different things like that to educate them to make sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| things like this don't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Ms. Byke, so the Duncan & Sons employees, they were taken through a training process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| to where they weren't familiar with each building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| and so basically in their profession they are trained employees with Duncan & Sons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=878)|
| 0:14:45| However, we went through our own training process with Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| so they are very familiar with the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| I will say this is a most unfortunate situation, and it is absolutely outside of the norm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=890)|
| 0:14:57| but it had nothing to do with their actual training and understanding of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| or what to do and what not to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| I just want to make sure to ask those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| How long is the training? Is it like a day orientation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| They went through several weeks of training prior to starting with Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| Okay. Do they usually stay at the school that they're at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| or do they kind of go around to different schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| They typically stay at the schools where they're at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| but with the needs, with the ongoing needs of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| if one of the selected schools needs a custodian from Duncan & Sons, we adjust accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=925)|
| 0:15:31| And we also still have our dream team that we deploy those resources to those schools as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| All right. Is there any more discussion on those items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| Dr. Eiswick, do you have an annual plans progress report for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=948)|
| 0:15:55| Thank you, Madam Chair. My update was so long that I hadn't looked ahead on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| At this time, we're going to do the presentation of the recommendation of the charter school application by our review team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| And with that, I will turn it over to who headed that up for us, Ms. Julie Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| Yes. Apparently, that wasn't supposed to be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| I think we did that last month. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| It wasn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| Daniel report, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| Oh, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| It was on mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| Oh, that was. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Okay. So the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| So we'll rewind and start again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Yes. The presentation of the charter school application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| We're going to have Ms. Thompson come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| And I think members of the team that were part of that process are here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| So I just want to say before we get started that I really appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| This is not something that we encounter every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| We take on every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| I appreciate Ms. Thompson just in her ability to really work closely with the state board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| and also the state and with trainers and really reaching out to make sure that the process was run correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| I appreciate Mr. Dupler and his input and us making those meetings, public meetings and all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| So, again, the process that you don't do every day is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| So I want to publicly thank you, Ms. Thompson, for leading this process for us and turn it over to you at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1043)|
| 0:17:42| So we are looking at the recommendation for the Knox Preparatory School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1062)|
| 0:17:50| And just to give you an overview, the plan we reviewed is a plan that would be a school for boys, grades 6 through 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1070)|
| 0:18:00| The location would be at 967 Irwin, which is the current Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1080)|
| 0:18:07| They would be leasing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| There is a focus on college preparation for minority and disadvantaged students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| And it is a replication of the Chattanooga Preparatory School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| So in the process of reviewing the Knox Prep application, we also reviewed the initial Chattanooga Prep application as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1099)|
| 0:18:31| The year one will begin with a maximum of 105 students for 6th grade and will add approximately 100 students each year through grade 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1111)|
| 0:18:44| Before we begin, I would like to recognize these are the people that served on the application review team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| We had a mixture of people from Knox County schools in various departments as well as community representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1130)|
| 0:18:59| And then Ms. Carol Swan from Swan Educational Solutions helped to lead us through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1139)|
| 0:19:07| As it's been about five years since we've been through this process, I wanted to make sure that we were able to do everything exactly the way we were supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1147)|
| 0:19:15| And so she's got extensive experience in charter schools, so we leaned on her as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1155)|
| 0:19:24| All right, so just to take you through a little bit of the review process timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| We received the letter of intent on November the 10th, and the review team was identified and trained January the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1170)|
| 0:19:43| We received their application on January the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| The due date was February the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| We received it the day before, so our actual review period began February the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1189)|
| 0:19:57| And we distributed the applications for the team to read and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| The application itself was over 300 pages, and so we needed some time to read that carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1203)|
| 0:20:12| And so we had a chance about three weeks for each review team member to read over the application, make notes, develop any questions that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1212)|
| 0:20:26| And then we met on the 24th of February collectively to plan for the capacity interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1226)|
| 0:20:33| That is the second phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| The application review is the first phase of this process, and then the second step is the capacity interview with Knox Prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1235)|
| 0:20:45| They came to the Sarah Simpson building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| We met with them and their team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| There were eight members from Knox Prep that were here, and all of our team members were in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1251)|
| 0:20:59| And so we had an opportunity to have conversation with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| We had developed our questions, but we also had a chance to ask some additional questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| and really have them explain to us what their vision and mission was for Knox Prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1267)|
| 0:21:15| Once that meeting was over, then the review team met that afternoon to go through our notes that we had made in our individual review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1275)|
| 0:21:26| as well as to discuss the capacity interview and to make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1286)|
| 0:21:33| And then we met again on March the 10th to review the recommendation report and the consensus rubric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1293)|
| 0:21:48| to make sure that it met all of the expectations, and we were all in agreement that the reports said the things that we wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1308)|
| 0:22:03| So I just wanted to remind you that the role of the charter application review team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| is to determine if the application meets the charter standards outlined in the Tennessee school application scoring criteria rubric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1328)|
| 0:22:18| That's a whole lot, but basically we have the rubric from the state and we have the application from Knox Prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| And our job is not to determine whether or not we feel like we need a charter school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1344)|
| 0:22:31| It's does that application meet the requirements of the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| It asks us to identify strengths in the application and then areas of concerns or questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| And during that capacity interview, we had an opportunity to ask some of those questions and share our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1362)|
| 0:22:50| There's four categories in the rubric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| The first one is about the academic plan. We looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| And then the second one is the operations plan, and then the financial plan, and then the fourth piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| if it is a replication application, what is their experience with the current school that they're already running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1385)|
| 0:23:14| And so we did all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| And so again, we reviewed the application independently, individually, and then collectively together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1397)|
| 0:23:26| to reach the consensus recommendation that we are presenting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| So to highlight some of the strengths of the application, there were clear academic goals and educational outcomes for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1411)|
| 0:23:39| There's a comprehensive plan to address the needs of students with disabilities, gifted and talented students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| and English language learners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| There's an intentional and strong focus on college preparation and acceptance for all students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| and the school calendar and schedule are designed to support remediation, enrichment, and extracurricular activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1434)|
| 0:24:04| There is a staffing plan, an extensive professional development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| and plans to hire, support, and retain teachers is well thought out and aligned with the mission and vision of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1450)|
| 0:24:18| Parent and community engagement and outreach support is evidenced through the letters of support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| and their participation in the application development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| The budget narrative and the budget documents are based on proven sound financial guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1467)|
| 0:24:35| The audits of the existing school, Chattanooga Prep, have been aligned with best auditing practices and have been free of findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1475)|
| 0:24:43| This was important. They currently don't have any financial records for us to audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| so we have to fall back on what they have done previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| So the Chattanooga Prep had no findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| The governing board and advisory board are knowledgeable and experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| and will include parent and community representatives from Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| And the previous experience in the successful operation of Chattanooga Preparatory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| along with the passion and commitment of the leaders of PrEP public schools, is evident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1506)|
| 0:25:14| Concerns and questions that will be addressed during year zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| And let me say, before I talk about these, we had to look at whether the application met or exceeded expectations or partially met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1518)|
| 0:25:30| And so these concerns that we have here are not things that would have caused us to have to select partially meets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1530)|
| 0:25:38| We feel like they met the expectations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| but these would be things that we would address as part of that charter monitoring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| charter authorizing during this year zero as they're planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| They won't have students at this time. This is their planning year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| Continuing plans to recruit, train, and retain mentors for each student will be an important component for student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| If you've looked at their application, you know that their plan is for each student to have a mentor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| And so we talked about how that was going to be important for them to have a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| and have a pool of people that would be able to mentor each of the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1573)|
| 0:26:20| Continue plans to support students with special needs to access and succeed in AP and dual enrollment classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1580)|
| 0:26:27| Their plan is for all students to have access and enroll in AP and dual enrollment classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1587)|
| 0:26:35| And we know that they will need to have some support for any special needs students that they have to be able to access those classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1595)|
| 0:26:46| Ensure that there are adequate parent and community representatives on the advisory and governing board to support Knoxville Preparatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1606)|
| 0:26:53| Currently, the PrEP public schools and Chattanooga PrEP has an advisory board and a governing board that meet in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1613)|
| 0:27:06| And we talked about the need. We want to make sure that we have Knox County people represented on that board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1626)|
| 0:27:13| and that there was a plan to meet in alternating places so that we could make sure that we're attending those meetings and able to participate in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1633)|
| 0:27:24| Work with the Office of Academic Support to implement a successful plan for the startup and preparation for year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1644)|
| 0:27:32| If that is approved for them to move forward, then that will begin an extensive amount of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| in terms of helping them to prepare to open a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| And that would be part of my office's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| The concerns above will be addressed during the planning year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| So the recommendation is that the charter application review team recommends that the application of Knoxville Preparatory Charter School be approved for the 24-25 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1673)|
| 0:28:05| So just to be clear, they will have a year of planning and then in the year 24-25 will be when they have the first students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1685)|
| 0:28:14| So just as a reminder to all of us, so the approval process, Knox PreP submitted their application on January 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1694)|
| 0:28:26| So we have 90 days to complete that with the 90 days beginning on February 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| which means then that we will have until May 1st to either approve or to deny the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1712)|
| 0:28:39| If the local board fails to either approve or deny, the application can be deemed automatically approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1719)|
| 0:28:47| If the board denies the application, there must be a reason given that will allow the charter sponsor to revise their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1727)|
| 0:28:55| So there will have to be something that they can go back and tweak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| And then they will have 30 days to resubmit a revised application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| That would trigger the review committee team again to meet, review their changes, and then bring another recommendation back to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1745)|
| 0:29:17| From the point of submission of the amendments, then we will have 60 days to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1757)|
| 0:29:26| The review team will have 60 days to review that resubmitted application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1766)|
| 0:29:35| If the school board denies the amended application, the sponsor may appeal to the Tennessee Public Charter School Commission within 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1775)|
| 0:29:45| And then at that point, the commission will review all of our documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| We will have to go to Nashville to make a presentation of the work that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| The commission may uphold the denial of the school board or they may overturn the denial and deem the application approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1796)|
| 0:30:05| If the commission deems that the application is approved, the school board and the charter school may mutually agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1805)|
| 0:30:13| that the school will remain part of the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| So if the charter commission approves, then they would come to us and we would have to decide if we were going to accept that and do the progress monitoring and oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1816)|
| 0:30:36| If an agreement cannot be reached, then the charter school would become part of the commission LEA and KCS will have no oversight of the charter school to ensure that they're compliant with all the federal and state laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1836)|
| 0:30:52| That concludes my presentation. I'll be happy to take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| Thank you, Ms. Thompson. Do we have any questions, board members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1862)|
| 0:31:32| Is Freddie back there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1892)|
| 0:32:02| All right. So board members, the system will be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1922)|
| 0:32:13| So you hit your light like you normally would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| And then when I call on you, they'll have to turn it on from the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| So there'll be a little bit of a delay, but they can't they can't control them back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| So that will be the system we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| So I believe before that all happened, Mr. Watson, that you were getting ready to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| So we will wait for. There you go. You're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| Test test. Very good. Awesome. Thank you all for working that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| I'm sorry for the frustration that that caused, but I'm glad we're able to get back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| Ms. Thompson, thank you so much for the work that you did and helping lead and facilitate and work with Swan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| I know to to do our charter review committee and all the I reviewed a lot of the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| but I'm sure not near to the depth that you all did. So I really appreciate you all doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| Ms. Thompson, is it fair to say that based on what the scope of work that you all have been challenged to do in terms of in terms of the way it's specified in law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1983)|
| 0:33:13| that you all are really not taking into account whether or not a school is good for a community or for Knox County schools as a system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| Correct. I mean, that's not really what you're being asked to do in a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| Right. So I think that's important for people to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| And that last slide, maybe it wasn't the last slide, but when you talked about what would happen if we approve versus when we didn't approve or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2007)|
| 0:33:36| It's obvious, I think, to anybody who's followed it, that Tennessee is very favorable to charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| I mean, if you read the list of what happens in the event that we approve or don't approve or we don't do anything, it gets approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| I mean, I don't think it's a secret that Tennessee is very favorable to charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| And I will tell you from my perspective, I don't think my role in this is to rehash charter school policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| I don't think that's our job here as a board either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| And I know a lot of people have different feelings about charter schools and what it does and does not do for public education system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2043)|
| 0:34:11| I can tell you in my process, I've tried to look at the school on its merits and I would do that with any charter school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2051)|
| 0:34:18| But I do have a couple of questions. We have had another charter school and we still do have another charter school in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| That's actually been around since for nine years, since 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| It has. I know it would not have been a part of the formal charter review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| But have you all been able to get a sense, Knox County schools, to understand what the impact Emerald Charter School has had or may have positively or negatively on surrounding schools within that community, schools that it's drawing from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2073)|
| 0:34:47| I know that's one of the concerns that folks have expressed in the public that another charter school would actually harm existing schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2087)|
| 0:34:54| So since we have some track record, does Knox County schools have any sense of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| So I'm not exactly sure what you're asking in terms of whether it's harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| Well, when I when I mean harm, I really mean in terms of enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| So what it may have done in terms of enrollment with schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| I think that's one of the concerns is that by adding another charter school, it might cause some schools to have enrollment that would that may lead them to close down at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2112)|
| 0:35:22| So do we understand the numbers in terms of the impacts of Emerald and the enrollment there and how it might have drawn from other schools and has it hurt those schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2122)|
| 0:35:31| So I will say this is this is my first year in the review process with Emerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| We have supported them pretty extensively as is as is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| I will say this year there they have reduced the suspensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2144)|
| 0:35:51| They've reduced the excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| They've increased their student retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| So we're not having as much going back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| I know that that when I was a supervisor and director, that was a complaint that I heard that students were going back and forth to their schools and going back to Emerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2160)|
| 0:36:12| We're seeing that greatly reduced and their teacher retention is also increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| So in terms of what the impact is having on that, they have they draw students from several different schools in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2177)|
| 0:36:28| So can I interrupt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| I think that Dr. Wilson has maybe some more insight, some more numbers and insight on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2191)|
| 0:36:38| Right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| Yes, I do. So I know when looking at that, we tried to go back and kind of look at some numbers because you're asking about staffing implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2201)|
| 0:36:48| And of course, with student population moving is where it starts to play into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| Sure. Looking, it would be hard to say exactly school by school what the exact impact would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| But looking at the current enrollment for our Emerald charter with they have two hundred and eighty four students projected for I'm sorry, currently enrolled at the elementary level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2218)|
| 0:37:08| And if you're looking across all the elementary schools across the district, I think four or five of those are a total of 20 students or more out of that school that are part of one school that they're drawing from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2228)|
| 0:37:19| They're drawing 20 students out of that zone school. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| Only in four cases across the district. So when you start to look, there's also a lot of single digit type type situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2242)|
| 0:37:30| And so, again, how that would play out as far as impact at a school level based on maximum class sizes, things like that at any one grade level, because that changes K to two and three to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2250)|
| 0:37:40| All of those different cuts. It would be hard to say year over year exactly what the staffing implication would be in that in the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2260)|
| 0:37:48| It would be similar again. It would depend on grade level and things of how those distribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| We've got one hundred and forty nine students from our middle schools that currently attend a charter with only two schools out of that group, over 20 students being pulled from from a single campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2272)|
| 0:38:04| So only two schools in the middle school are of 20 or more. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| And then in thinking again about impact, just trying to think about impact, I think, for an additional charter focused on grade six through 12, focused on the middle schools and that impact for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2288)|
| 0:38:21| I'll say on the front end that it's, you know, it's somewhat impossible to know exactly because, as Miss Thompson actually we're just talking about, you know, there's no way to know exactly which schools would be impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2301)|
| 0:38:33| We know schools that would fit the, I think, characteristics that we expect these students to or we expect the charter school to to look towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2313)|
| 0:38:43| And in looking at those, if they were to split that hundred and five students, let's say equally across the four middle schools, we would anticipate and those would be just looking at Holston, Northwest Vine and Little Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2323)|
| 0:38:54| If that were to happen and again spread evenly, which may not be the case, each of those schools could potentially lose a position or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2334)|
| 0:39:03| And again, it would depend on exactly where they fail and how that fell out across those grade levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| Again, those are just estimates and would be hard to to make firm numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| Sure. I've got all that. I'd be happy to share. Yeah, there's so many variables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| And really what I'm trying to get at is kind of what the maximum potential impact would be for any one school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| You know, the maximum would be 105 that they happen to draw 105 from one school, which is probably not likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| I know when I visited chat prep, one of the things I tried to get some understanding about is how far they drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2367)|
| 0:39:33| And one of the things that I was learning is that they were drawing for even from even 30 minutes away from Ottawa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| So I'm sure I mean, I know the concentration is more surrounding the school, but it seems like they're drawing from much further away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| Miss Thompson, you had mentioned that the retention rate for Emerald has improved on students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| And the only reason I'm asking for this number is because I know what the retention rate is for for chat prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| And I'm trying to get a sense of it's similar. Do you know what that what it's moved to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| No, we just had a we had our visit, our spring visit with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| And they just mentioned that that all of those things had improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| Yeah, it didn't give us specific numbers, but I can get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| Yeah, because they're the only school that allows us to have some sense of precedent in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| It'd be I would like to know what the retention rate is for their students and also staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| What is that grown to? And at that point, I'm happy to share what it is a chat prep to because I think it's good to kind of get a sense of, you know, it's not about good or bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2420)|
| 0:40:29| It's just having something to compare it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| I do know that they've been very intentional in their staffing and in hiring of an additional behavior dean support to be able to support students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2432)|
| 0:40:45| And so that has helped with decreasing their suspension rate and increasing students time in the classrooms and reducing the movement from Emerald to Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2445)|
| 0:41:03| Thank you. I've got a lot more questions, but not for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| So I'm going to ask you one more. And that is you had mentioned some of the impacts of us approving it versus if it goes to commission and gets approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2466)|
| 0:41:15| And you as a part of that, you talked about oversight. Is there any other potential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2475)|
| 0:41:21| What are the other potential impacts of Knox County schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| Let's say we do not approve it and it ends up getting appealed and it gets approved at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| What are their impacts besides us not managing the oversight would occur? Is there any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2490)|
| 0:41:41| I'm not aware of the I would just say, though, these are Knox County students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2501)|
| 0:41:50| And so I do feel like there's great value in the work that we've been doing with Emerald in terms of progress monitoring and supporting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2510)|
| 0:42:00| We have monthly our special ed department visits them monthly and works with the special ed teachers just like they do in all of our Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2520)|
| 0:42:10| We do that annual performance review that you all have approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| You've seen that that's extensive. That's tied directly to the charter standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| We meet monthly with the Emerald leadership team and then we also conduct two visits throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2539)|
| 0:42:29| We also attend their board meetings and we send a weekly charter message that gives us an opportunity to communicate with them what the state expectations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2549)|
| 0:42:41| There's lots of reports that that they have to send us to let us know they're in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| So all of that, that charter monitoring, that charter authorizing that we do, I feel like has really helped us to help Emerald to grow into into a viable school that supports our Knox County students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2567)|
| 0:43:03| So even though the level of, and I'm going to use this word not negatively, but to the level that like central office has control over our individual public schools right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2583)|
| 0:43:17| We know that we don't have that same level of control over Emerald or any other charter school, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| But to the degree that we do engage, what I'm hearing you say is, is that there is an, in your mind, there's an overall net benefit to Knox County schools being engaged in that particular charter school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2601)|
| 0:43:34| I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| Ms. Byte, I think you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| No, you're on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| To kind of ping off of what Daniel said, can you describe kind of the exact chain of oversight that would happen if it were to remain under Knox County schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2629)|
| 0:43:58| Because I know like for the people in my district and things like that, you know, if the parents go through principal and so forth, then they can come to me and then wrap it back around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2638)|
| 0:44:10| I can go to central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| But what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| What exactly does that look like for a charter school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| So are you speaking, if they would have a parent complaint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| A parent complaint or any sort of issue like that that would typically come to a board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| So, of course, we would expect them to have talked to the principal, to run, to have gone through all the chain of command at the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2665)|
| 0:44:37| And then at the Knox Prep or at the Prep Public Schools level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| We have had, I've had to deal with one situation this year, but I've been able to talk to the parent and talk with Emerald and able to get that resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2682)|
| 0:44:54| So it really is not our role to engage necessarily with parent complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2694)|
| 0:45:01| We try to work with the charter school to make sure that they're able to resolve issues with parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2701)|
| 0:45:10| So it would potentially be their board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| And their board is not elected, but appointed? Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| Okay. So in that case, the parents would never come to us or we would never necessarily know to that. They would at most go to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2719)|
| 0:45:29| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| I have more questions, but I think that's all for Julie. I don't know when we're supposed to kind of do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2733)|
| 0:45:41| Braver Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| Unusual you wait for red to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2743)|
| 0:45:49| Just for clarification, because I've heard it both ways, that if the commission deems an application approved, the school board and the charter school sponsor may mutually agree that the school will remain part of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2749)|
| 0:46:11| So it doesn't automatically mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| They would give us the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| They have an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| So we say no, and the commission says yes, then we have an option at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| It has to be mutual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| Mutual agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Just wanted to make sure that that was clarified because I was kind of hearing it the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| It was automatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| And these may not be questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| I think they are, though, in the application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| Did you check the data of some of the responses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| Because I'm getting some conflicts of information, and I'm not sure if it's just the source of the information I'm getting it from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2804)|
| 0:46:55| But things like suspensions and what were the percent of students suspended at Knox Prep versus, and then also the issue of students being suspended or not from Emerald Youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2815)|
| 0:47:16| That comparison, I don't know if I was hearing you say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| Comparison between Emerald and Knox Prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| Is that a comparison that you make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| No, we did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| So when you talked about Emerald Youth having students coming and going, was that suspensions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2846)|
| 0:47:35| No, that would have been students that were choosing to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2855)|
| 0:47:41| So how did they leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| You said choosing to go back to Emerald after they were suspended or left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2864)|
| 0:47:50| I was confused by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| So it's my understanding parents choosing to re-enroll their children in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2871)|
| 0:47:58| That was being reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| They were choosing to stay at Emerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| In the past, there have been difficulties with parents enrolling students at Emerald and then unenrolling them at Emerald and re-enrolling them back in Knox County schools in the middle of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2882)|
| 0:48:14| So you looked at that as a means of, I'm trying to understand what was that factor in terms of evaluating this application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2894)|
| 0:48:27| We didn't use information from Emerald to evaluate this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2907)|
| 0:48:35| Okay, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| And part of it is just when you said it, a flag went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| So what was the significance of that in terms of this application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| I think that might have been part of Mr. Watson's question about you asking the impact that Emerald had had, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2928)|
| 0:48:56| Yeah, my question was because we only had one charter school already in Knox County, I was just trying for my own purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2936)|
| 0:49:03| I know that this was not a part of the work of the Charter Review Committee, was to understand what are some of the trends that we've seen with our existing school and how might they compare with the CHAT Prep, actually, because Knox Prep has no data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2943)|
| 0:49:16| It doesn't exist yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| And so that's my line of questioning, was to try to understand how do they have some correlation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| But I'm sure it was not a part of the actual review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| Okay, well thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| That helped clear that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| So I did look at the application, and once again I echo not to the extent that you all did, and thank you for the effort you made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2971)|
| 0:49:41| And thank Knox Prep for the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| They checked all the boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| And so, but I did have some questions about some specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| When I looked at a student selection enrollment process, how do we, how is that, I looked at the lottery would only kick in if you don't have, if you have more than the students, more than 105 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=2991)|
| 0:50:09| So what was that enrollment process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| How does that enrollment process happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| Is it first come, first serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| I did see all of the information parents would have to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| So in providing the information, is the information evaluated to determine if that's the person that they have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3018)|
| 0:50:27| How is that decided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| It's my understanding that they're going to accept the applications at the school level up into 105 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3029)|
| 0:50:37| If they have more than 105 applications, then that's going to automatically trigger a blind lottery that they will have an independent person or independent organization manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3037)|
| 0:50:52| So, for example, they could have applications from students all over the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| And when they, when they go to that blind lottery, then it's not just going to select from a particular school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3058)|
| 0:51:07| It, I don't know if that, does that help answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| Yes, it helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| So the other question was in parent engagement and community support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3076)|
| 0:51:23| I saw you had that as a strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| And that was, was that the strength of the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| Or was that strength of the details of how they would do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| That's strength of their plan to do that, to have parent engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| And we also reviewed the Chattanooga Prep application and their plans for student, for parent engagement in that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3098)|
| 0:51:48| And then of the 16 letters of support, how many was from the community where the school is located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3108)|
| 0:51:57| I don't have the application in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| I can get that information for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| And then the other question that I had was the process of initiating, but that may not be a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3125)|
| 0:52:20| I'll stop right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| Ms. Hillen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| Thank you for going through this giant application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| I would challenge the board members to get through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3153)|
| 0:52:40| And frankly, even being as crazy as I am, I've not gotten through all of it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| But I have gotten through some things that concern me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| And so I'd like to know whether in the process of looking at this application, if the committee had time to delve into a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3170)|
| 0:53:00| Did the committee have time to do any fact checking throughout this application to ensure its accuracy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3180)|
| 0:53:09| We were encouraged to do that individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| I know that we, I went on and tried to find lots of different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| We looked at the state report card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| We looked at a variety of resources that we could go and Google and check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3201)|
| 0:53:29| And I feel like other people on the committee did the same thing as we had our discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| Okay. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| And the reason I'm asking about that specifically regarding the claims that are made, if we're looking at page 9, and it's 9 of the 377, so the first section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3217)|
| 0:53:48| there's a claim regarding segregation in a specific community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| And when you look at where that data has come from, it's data from a study that was done in 1990 through 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3233)|
| 0:54:01| So it's data that's 23 to 33 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| So it concerns me that we're basing this application on data about segregation that is 23 to 33 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3244)|
| 0:54:15| I'm also concerned, if we were listening when Dr. Wilson spoke to the middle schools, I believe he listed Holston, Vine, Northwest, and Whittle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3255)|
| 0:54:29| Yet when we look at the data, Whittle isn't included in the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| So did the committee address that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| We were aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| So in considering this application and its focus, it was okay to leave out the school that, I mean, so here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3279)|
| 0:54:52| This charter school is slated to be in the middle of, well, not in the middle, but inside of the Whittle Springs school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3292)|
| 0:55:01| Yet we haven't included Whittle Springs in any of our data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| I think it's also concerning that it's also on the edge of the Central High School and West High School zones, and that data is also not included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3305)|
| 0:55:15| We also have a very liberal transfer policy to L&N STEM Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| That's not included, nor is Career Magnet Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| So it concerns me that there's absent data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| And did the committee discuss that at all, or just were aware that they weren't there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3330)|
| 0:55:36| We were aware that it wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3338)|
| 0:55:45| Okay. I think that's that for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| Looking back at oversight, and I know that you said that we look at how students are doing and we support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3347)|
| 0:56:01| But as far as oversight of the actual processes that they are using, oversight of their staff, oversight of their decision making, what kind of oversight authority do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3361)|
| 0:56:17| So we have the authority to oversee based on state law and our charter agreement that we have with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3377)|
| 0:56:31| I guess I'm asking not really where we are legally said that we have oversight, but what specific oversight do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3391)|
| 0:56:42| What can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| What is the scope of our oversight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| Beyond just submitting that annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| Well, we have weekly, as I said, we have weekly communication with them through our weekly charter message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3413)|
| 0:57:04| We meet with the school leadership every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| And we also attend the board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| That's where we have an opportunity to hear their financial statements and hear of any concerns or problems that they have or celebrations that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3435)|
| 0:57:25| And we visit them twice a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| And they have reports, there's extensive reports as part of the charter expectations that they are required to send to us and to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3450)|
| 0:57:41| And Emerald is always excellent about getting their reports to us on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| We have a chance to review anything that we have questions about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| We have a very good collaborative working relationship with Emerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| And we have been intentional about growing that so that we can make sure that we are offering them the support that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3476)|
| 0:58:04| Okay, I appreciate that we are working with our current charter, but it doesn't feel like oversight to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3484)|
| 0:58:16| And I will give this example with Reverend Butler's permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| I meet monthly here with Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| I don't have oversight of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| I may hear reports that Reverend Butler gives, but I don't have oversight of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3510)|
| 0:58:36| We have a good collaborative relationship, but I don't have oversight of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| So I think oversight is when we have authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| And I'm not hearing anything here that says that we have authority of really any kind over any charter school, Emerald or any other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3526)|
| 0:58:56| The only authority that I know we've ever had is the authority to submit the annual report that they give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3536)|
| 0:59:06| Is there something I'm missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| Well, if there were things that they were out of compliance with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| then we do have the authority to go in and expect them to correct those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| But the point of a charter school is to give them some freedom to do some things that are innovative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3558)|
| 0:59:26| And the charter law allows them to do that and will limit us in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3566)|
| 0:59:35| it's not like when I was a supervisor I could go in and visit the school and talk to the principal and give them suggestions and hold them accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3575)|
| 0:59:45| for that because I was their evaluator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| We don't have that kind of authority with a charter school because of the charter law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3588)|
| 0:59:55| Okay. So our oversight is in helping them and in requesting that they do things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3595)|
| 1:00:05| but we can't hold them accountable for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| Unless they are doing things that are illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| Okay. So listening to all of the different kinds of meetings and support that you're giving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3613)|
| 1:00:22| I'm looking at the authorizer fee expenses from the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3622)|
| 1:00:30| And looking at the percentage of time that each person is putting in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| it seems like it's a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| And yet most of the folks on this list are putting in 1 or 2% of their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3639)|
| 1:00:46| I'm especially concerned that we have legal counsel listed at 2% of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3646)|
| 1:00:53| which if 2% is spent there, there's no way we could spend 2% at all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| And our executive director of academic supports is putting in 5% of his time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| The more we grow exponentially, are those time percentages growing that much as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3663)|
| 1:01:14| So if we go from one school to two, would it be reasonable to expect that that time would double?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3674)|
| 1:01:21| Possibly, but things such as our monthly meetings, we would do those together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3681)|
| 1:01:29| And so the charter messages that we send out, we would be sending out to both schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3689)|
| 1:01:42| It's not exactly double time, but it would be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3702)|
| 1:01:48| And beginning year one, then Knox Prep would also pay that authorizer fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3708)|
| 1:01:55| All right, I don't think I have any more questions. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3715)|
| 1:02:09| I just wanted to clarify one thing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3729)|
| 1:02:14| I think Ms. Thompson said this well, but just to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| I think you paint a good picture, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| When the state board got out of the authorizing business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| the evolution of how this whole thing happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| when the current governor decided to create a charter committee that proves that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| the state board changed its trajectory of what it was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| Before, it was the body that approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| They moved into the business of holding LEAs and districts accountable for what we have to give a report every year about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3761)|
| 1:02:50| How are you building those relationships?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| I think Mr. Watson said this well earlier, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| The state laws and the state setups are favorable for that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| And I'm not making a value or judgment call in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| I'm just saying that's kind of how it's set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| So our, as an LEA, and to Ms. Thompson's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| those aren't our choices, how much time we spend and how much time we don't spend and how much we charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| That's all set by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| So we're required to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| What the state board then came out with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| okay, instead of authorizing charters, we are now going to be the body that evaluates annually the authorizer, which is us, the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3799)|
| 1:03:28| So those are the things that Ms. Thompson is complying with and her division is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3808)|
| 1:03:34| And again, that's not a fee we can leverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| All that's set by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| The fact that we have to become, if we lose our ability to authorize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| then it's a straight path through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| This board never sees this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| If Knox County Schools loses its ability to be an authorizer, it goes straight to a state charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| So I'm just saying a lot of these things are things that are requirements by state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| and now by the state board as an authorizer that we have our own rubric that we get a score annually on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| based on have we done those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| So again, I'm not placing a value statement on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| I'm just saying these aren't things that we can arbitrarily decide to do or not to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| These are things that we get an evaluation on from the state board of education that was set by the laws that were passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| So a lot of this stuff is, again, is not, still no value statement, but is not our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3853)|
| 1:04:20| It's what we have to do to be a functioning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| So I just want to make sure that was clear for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| And if I could say, really, since I have taken over this role of charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3865)|
| 1:04:31| I understand that there's two prongs to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| And as Dr. Roswick said, we have the ability to review applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| and make recommendations to the board for new charters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| But we also have an expectation from the state that we comply with the authorizing standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3885)|
| 1:04:51| And that's quite extensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| We have to submit a report on how well we have done in authorizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| and overseeing the charters that we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| And so I feel like having one charter this year has given me an opportunity to stick my toe in the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3902)|
| 1:05:09| and become very familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| And Memphis reviewed 10 applications this year, and I have over 50 charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3911)|
| 1:05:18| So I feel like we've gotten a good feel for what a quality authorization looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3918)|
| 1:05:25| and what the expectations are from my office and my department to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3925)|
| 1:05:33| Ms. Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| I've got a few questions, so bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| First question is, does Emerald have any students that are on track to have a SPED diploma?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3939)|
| 1:05:48| I don't know that answer. I can find out for you, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| If you could find out, that would be awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| And then also, earlier you mentioned that some students at Emerald had kind of gone back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3954)|
| 1:06:03| and that that was reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| And being that you had also described that the charter school has a little bit more freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| in what they can do and be innovative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| what safeguards are in place for students who are enrolling mid-year or unenrolling mid-year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3971)|
| 1:06:19| and what does that process look like if the curriculum might be a little bit different or a lot different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3979)|
| 1:06:27| So you mean on the Knox County side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| From Knox County to the charter school and back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| Just either way, whichever way it would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=3995)|
| 1:06:42| Well, I mean, speaking, I'll put my principal hat on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| When we get new students mid-year, then many times there are some assessments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4006)|
| 1:06:53| benchmark assessments we give to them to see where their progress is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| and make those determinations so that we can support them however they're coming to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4017)|
| 1:07:05| So they would be treated kind of like a student that would be coming from out of district into our district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4025)|
| 1:07:11| Well, they would share their information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| Would they use the same benchmark assessments or would they use different companies and different assessments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4034)|
| 1:07:21| They have a couple of different things that they use, but I believe they also use AIMSweb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4041)|
| 1:07:29| Okay. Are they required to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| I'm going to ask Ms. Jones to come and speak because she can speak about specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4055)|
| 1:07:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| Could you repeat the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| In benchmarks and assessments for, I guess, students that would be coming potentially from this charter school back to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4078)|
| 1:08:07| and just in that transition, would this charter school, are they required to use the same assessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4087)|
| 1:08:15| or what assessments and benchmarks would they use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| Where are the requirements kind of at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| They would still be required to respond in the same manner that we would when asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4100)|
| 1:08:26| That was one of the questions that I did ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| In the review process, they are using the same exact benchmarks that we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| They're also using some of the same intervention programs that we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| Are they required to do that or is that just an elective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| I'm not sure if it's required, but I would assume that they are using the same state requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4121)|
| 1:08:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| That's all for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| My next question is, are there board meetings publicly noticed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4131)|
| 1:09:02| I don't know the answer to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| Dr. Ryslick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| I might be able to answer a couple of those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| So first, yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| They're required by the same as any other public school to be able to make those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| And I think a little clarity on the benchmarking, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| Because I've talked to Ms. Owen about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| There's a law right now being pushed around around benchmarking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| and people have different understandings of what that word means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| So they will be required by state to do the same thing as a public school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| to do the RTI universal screener that looks at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| Dr. Phillips and Gray explained this in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| but it looks at foundational reading skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| They're required because they are a public school to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| The state puts out the assessments that are approved for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| and it sounds like they're using the same universal screener,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| which in our case is AIMSweb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| As far as benchmarking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| that typically is an assessment that people give to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| if their kids are going to be proficient or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| We use Case 21 or Master Review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| It's been bought out so many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| Master Review, I think, is what they're called now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| I believe in reading through the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| They may be NWA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| NWA, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| Maps, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| I don't know since I've read through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| but I'm going, so they do a benchmark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| but it is different than the benchmark that we use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| but they would be required by law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| because they're a state public school to do the same RTI process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| But they could pick a different universal screener| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| as long as it's approved by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| So that's where you get in that kind of monitoring verse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| They're still required to do everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| that a state public school is required to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| with the same amount of flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| So we couldn't come in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| you're not using AIMSweb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| You have to use AIMSweb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| It's approved, and that would meet our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| to say, good, you're following the state process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| and the state law to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| So that's where it's kind of loose tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| They still have to follow the same laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| but have some flexibility in how they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| And my next question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| there's an average per pupil spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| and essentially that's what they will get from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4260)|
| 1:11:06| And that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| thank you to Mr. Scott for answering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| all of my questions today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| especially last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| But it seemed like some of the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| they might be using third-party vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| and I'm curious where that funding would come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| if they needed to use a third-party vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| if that would be, or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| sorry, this is just a long question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| and bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| How you had mentioned earlier with Emerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| that there are times where someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| from Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| needs to come to provide support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| Where's that position that would do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| We're paying 100% of their salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| or are we splitting their salary with the charter school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| if we had a position that needed to provide services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| So it depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| They have some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| they would have some services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| that they could contract out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| For example, with Children's Hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| Emerald contracts for speech services there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| They contract with us for food services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| and I'm assuming that Knox Prep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4335)|
| 1:12:19| would be able to do also the transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| They contract directly with the bus contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| Would that come from the average per-pupil spending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| Or would they get additional funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| They don't get additional funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| So they would never get anything additional from us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| It's capped at the per-pupil spending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| I'm hesitant to say never,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| But I think the intent is that they would not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| that they have to have some additional funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| donations, endowments, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| So, like when Emerald needs to contract with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| for other services with Children's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| where does that expense get put?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4384)|
| 1:13:12| Is that in their budget, or is that in our budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| It's in their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| Dr. Rice, do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| Sure, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| Just because I know we had our first one-on-one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| budget meeting with one of you all today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| and this came up in the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| So it has typically been a funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| of an average per-pupil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| that gets passed on to any charter by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| With the new TISA funds that are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| the whole funding model is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| I'm so getting in Jennifer and Ron's lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| so I'll just explain this real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| But it's kind of basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| a student is built off kind of a base amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| and for all the different services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| they potentially could get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| those dollars go in if they receive ELL services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| special education services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| So it kind of builds out what a student earns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| So it will no longer be the dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| that go through based on the BEP average for the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| It will now be just the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| as what we're getting for our students, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| So it will be based on every individual student's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| what they get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| So those dollar amounts are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| All that money will go to the charter school then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| and back to where we have the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| that they are providing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| They can't say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| we don't have a wheelchair access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| so that kid came up next in the lottery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| and we're not going to provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| They have to be able to put the lift gate on the bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| and do all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| They can use that from the pot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| that follows the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| and they can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| or they can offset that with private funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| or whatever kinds of things they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| But our job is to look at that and to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| you're required to do these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| by federal law and or state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| That's how we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| So how they use those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| is based on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| and again, they can offset that with private money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| So to know exactly what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| There's also federal dollars, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| And so we're required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| for students who go over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| and I know Mr. Myers had a lot of background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| on this side too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| but we provide the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| So if there are dollars that we're using for a training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| then this is how it's worked with Emerald| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| and with any other charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| If it's money that comes to the district for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| that's the same when it comes to things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| like federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| If they qualify for Title I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| they fit in our spiral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| the way we spiral out funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| they would be treated just like a Knox County school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| and receive those funds to those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| Still required by the same federal law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| and all the parameters that our schools are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| but they have a lot less oversight into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| again, not the federal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| but a lot less oversight into who they contract with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| and what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| That's where we come in more is oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| into does every kid have the materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| they need like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| Those are the things we look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| but as far as to say you shouldn't use that test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| as long as it's in compliance with federal law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| and they're following Tennessee standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| That's kind of where our oversight ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| unless one of those laws, as Ms. Thompson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| is being broken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| both either federally or state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| I think that's all the questions I have for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| I have another question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| I think some of what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| in this financial conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| one of the narratives about charter schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| is that they take funding from public schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| because, as we just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| roughly the average of a per-pupil spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| will come out of that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| out of a public school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| a traditional public school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| and it'll follow that student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| It's also true that there are more costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| associated with running a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| than what an individual student may need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| And so what you're really having a conversation about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| is economies of scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| In a system like ours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| with 60,000 students and 91 schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| there's things that we can fund from our public dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| even though many of us feel like it's not adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| There's things that we can fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| that a one standalone school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| could not get funded through their public dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| So it makes sense that they would seek out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| private funding in addition to an offset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| because you can't run a school at quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| with an average per-pupil spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| of Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| because you don't have the economy of scale, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| So I think it's important to state that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| and just make sure everybody understands that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| that I don't think any of us believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| that by withdrawing students from a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| that all the costs associated with that school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| are also going to be transferred out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| because there's some other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| that are going to be left behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| For instance, the upkeep of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| You still got to upkeep the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| whether or not the enrollment is 200 or if it's 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| You still got to upkeep the building, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| So that's part of the conversation that we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| My last question for you, Ms. Thompson, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| is around there's the initial application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| and approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| but then what happens if a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| ultimately gets out of compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| or is not performing at the level that it's intended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| What role does the district have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| in terms of potentially revoking the status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| or flagging the school or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| What are those possibilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| There's an extensive process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| that we can go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| We'll work with the state charter commission to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| And I actually have a training next week on that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| I'm sure you're getting all the trainings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| I'm sure you just love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| So can you just bullet point for us, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| I know you haven't gone through the training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| but ultimately, does Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| have the authority at some point in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| should it get approved and it opens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| to say, hey, this isn't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| If they're certainly not meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| the academic expectations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| then we have a process for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| Well, and I think that's important to be known,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| and I know that we're not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| going to hash out all the details about that tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| but I don't think anybody wants a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| half-serving our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| to be able to continue to exist in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| That there has to be some level of accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| That is part of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| of the performance review that we do each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| And so we look at their academic data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| their financial data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| all of those kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| and we also have the charter agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| and in that it states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| that if they're not performing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| then we can seek revocation of their charter agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| And I know there's representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| of the school here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| I'm assuming it's appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| for us to ask direct questions, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| The reason I'm asking that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| I think there's some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| that make more sense for you to answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| and I think there's more questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| that make sense for them to answer directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| There's kind of two things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| that are happening in this conversation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| We're debating policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| and whether or not charter schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| should even exist in what they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| or do not do in a public education system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| but also we have a very specific application here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| from a very specific school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| and to me that's another set of questions in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| So I'm assuming that's appropriate, correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| to ask questions directly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| I haven't asked them to come prepared to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| but I mean, I don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| Is that something we are able to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| Mr. Scott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| is that something you are willing to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| Yeah, I mean, they're here and willing, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| I didn't think they showed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| just to fill up the first few rows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| Exactly, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| Yeah, okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| Ms. Soen, I think you were next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| You have some specific...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| Or, Reverend Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| I just have one order on that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| and I was going to ask it when we first got started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| but when we're reviewing our regular agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| we should do that then versus doing this now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4864)|
| 1:21:09| because right now we're basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4869)|
| 1:21:10| looking at the committee's application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| or committee's approval, rather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| Mr. Dupour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| Thank you, Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| and, yeah, I turn my light on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| because the NOx PREP folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| are under no obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| to answer any questions at this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| but, I mean, if they wish to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| and want to honor that request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| they can, that's the first thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| And the second thing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| I mean, I think it's the pleasure of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| but I think, to Reverend Butler's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| this particular item is on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| the Charter School Application Review Team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| recommendation as opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| the broader question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| and Mr. Watson talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| charter policy and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| and, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| charter policy is not before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| I mean, legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| it's what's in the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| and whether or not the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| should be approved or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| And I do know that we also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| at least one administrator here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| that has school early in the morning, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| who's later in the agenda, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| So, I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| that we do that as well, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| So, I did have my light on for another issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| but I think Ms. Owens was ahead of me, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| So, I just had a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| about the application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| Does the application process require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| for there to be any research done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| or anything supplied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| about the effect of the placement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| of the charter school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| on the existing Knox County schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| Is there any requirement for that to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| I didn't see there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| I just want to make sure that I didn't miss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| You mean the impact on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=4996)|
| 1:23:21| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| I have three questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| one coming off of what Ms. Byke said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| one coming off of what Dr. Reiswick said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| and one other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| and these may be either for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| or for Dr. Reiswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| So, looking at Member Byke's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| she asked specifically about the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| and where it might come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| if they needed additional supports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| and I'm looking, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| at the 2021-22 authorizer fee expenses list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| and we know that the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| puts in $35,000 for support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| but in 21-22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| what we actually spent was $40,691.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| So, where did that extra $5,691 come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| Is that $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| that Knox County schools added in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| to those expenditures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| Did that come from a charter school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| How did we spend more than we had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| So, the $35,000 authorizer fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| comes directly from the charter school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| It does not come from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| It comes from the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| and the extra that would have been spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5076)|
| 1:24:40| would have been in-kind work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| So, it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| just as part of my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| just as part of my job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| the hours that I put in after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| I appreciate the way you said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| as in-kind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| because a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| we don't think of in-kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| as being an expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| So, just like when we're running for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| if somebody gives us something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| if somebody gives us supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| or somebody gives us time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| somebody had that expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| I would like to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| while I realize that we've gone over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| we take very seriously the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| that these are Knox County students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| and so to do the extra work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| to make certain that we're following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| all the expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| and that Emerald is following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| all the expectations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| that's the reason for the extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| Right, and that's exactly what I expect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| which is why I wanted to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| because I don't want it to sound like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| we are not putting in that amount of support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| because we support our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| just like we support all of our other schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| and so when we add in additional schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| obviously we have more places to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| So, if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| and this may be a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| I don't know who this is a question for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| so if this were approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| by the Charter Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| and the Charter Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| became the authorizer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| so that what Dr. Reiswick said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| it would just be a pass-through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| we would just be the pass-through for that funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| if the State Charter Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| were the authorizer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| would there be any supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| required from Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| or would all of the supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| be from the Charter Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| from the authorizing commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| It's my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| we would have no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| Okay, so all of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| all of that in-kind time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| that we might expend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| would be the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| of the state authorizer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| instead of from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| And I only have one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| When talking about performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| and at what point we could look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| that performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| anywhere in the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| is there an intended performance level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| that we expect them to reach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| So when we go back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| let's say 10 years from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| we are looking at this again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| not me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| but 10 years from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| we're looking at this again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| and we're looking to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| did they reach the performance level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| that was expected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| Do we know right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| what that expected performance level is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| or is that something to be determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| by some future board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| They would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| they would have improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| They would set annual goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| just like all of our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| set annual goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| They have to create that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| performance plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| and enter that into E-Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| and so the same expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| our schools have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| for academic achievement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| would be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| Okay, and I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| my justification for asking this question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| is really because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| in a legislative committee this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| there was a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| about the Achievement School District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| and the question was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| what should happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| with the Achievement School District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| after it was approved 13 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| and now at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| they ask very specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| how are those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| individual schools progressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| and the answer was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| that some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| have risen above the fifth bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| the bottom fifth percentile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| and one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| was in the sixth percentile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| so I assume that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| that would not be the kind of achievement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| we would be looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| So it's my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| that there's an expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| that they would achieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| at a greater rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| Okay, but we don't have a definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| of what that rate is expected to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| There's not, I don't believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| there's a specific number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| All right, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| Ms. Thompson, one more question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| just because I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| I fully heard the answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| when Reverend Butler asked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| I don't think it was specifically addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| He was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| the idea of cherry picking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| and talking about the lottery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| and that once those 105 slots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| are taken up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| then it would move to the lottery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| but then what happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| what's the litmus test before that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| and he asked the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| he said does it first come first serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| what is the school actually using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| to determine which of those applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| they approve or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| Do they have to approve every applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| up to the first 105| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| or what is that test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| that's the litmus test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| on that application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| Is it first come first serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| It's my understanding that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| And the reason this is an important question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| is the reason that's an important question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| is because I know that's one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| of the major concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| that this charter school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| specifically would end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| just choosing kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| who already have a likelihood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| to be more higher proficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| and that they're just going to pull those kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| out from our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| and to me that's a really valid concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| and I want to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| is there room for that to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| and could there be something afoot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| to make that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| I'm sure there's lots of other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| that are indirect like marketing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| and how you market and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| but in terms of the application process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| and the criteria itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| is it first come first serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| until they get to that point of needing lottery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| It's our expectation that it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| first come first serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| and then once they have that 106th application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| then it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| So let me ask that though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| because that to me doesn't make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| in that if you only have 105 spots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| and you get to the 106th application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| why do you need a lottery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| Right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| but it depends if it's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| during their application period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| so they haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| an application period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| just like Emerald has an application period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| Sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| Okay so let's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| I'm just throwing out some rough numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| because I really don't want to understand how this works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| so let's say they had 150 applicants apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| for the first class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5493)|
| 1:31:34| if it really is first come first serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| and okay let's say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| out of those 150| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| only 120 stay in the application pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| I work with families all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| we have to apply for the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| at the restoration house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| I get people withdraw application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| and they do all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| but let's say 120 actually stick it through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| complete the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| and go through the whole process right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| If it really is first come first serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| then you would never need the lottery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| because you have more applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| than the slots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| so those 105 would be filled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| so what would actually cause a lottery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| to be tripped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| if it truly is first come first serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| and I don't know if somebody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| from the school might be able to answer this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| which I'm fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| but to me it's an important part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| and I don't know that it's spelled out enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| in the detail of the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| to understand how that works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| we've talked a lot about lottery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| but to me it doesn't make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| the way we've described it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| well it's my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| they have an application period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| Emerald does the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| they have an application period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| and they take as many applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| during that period as they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| and so if they don't have 105| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| then it's first come first serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| and they take the ones that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| okay so now I think I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| so if it's 120| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| then all applicants in that pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| are up for lottery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| I got you that makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| I'm sorry I wasn't clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| no it wasn't you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| it's just because there's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| there's nuance to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| and so I probably was not asking the question well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| but that makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| yes thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| Ms. Owen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| thank you Madam Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| looking at the lottery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| I understand the blind lottery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| and my question would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| what if there were significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| more applicants than slots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| and during this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| during the blind lottery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| over 50% of the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| ended up coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| a high income area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| would that change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| the focus of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5622)|
| 1:33:48| I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| I don't think it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| I think they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| they would take the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| that they received in the lottery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| so potentially let's say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| we had 300 students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| that over half of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| could come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| a much higher income area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| Ms. Henderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| thank you Madam Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| I just wanted to offer up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| some clarifying information too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| on the Tennessee DOE website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| there is a charter school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| enrollment and lottery procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| so that may be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| after the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| all right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| Mr. Watson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| I appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| I think I'm sure all of us do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| there's some questions that are being asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| that I think some of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| actually know the answers to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| but part of the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| why they're being asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| is because I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| community has the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5698)|
| 1:34:59| I think the community needs to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| that we all have done our due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| and we've tried to ask the right questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| and we've tried to ask them publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| so that way they understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| the information that we're using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| so I appreciate the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| to address those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| all right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| so does anyone else have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| any other questions or comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| for Ms. Thompson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| as far as the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| of the charter school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| application review team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| all right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| so I do think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| board members we do need to move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| with our regular agenda items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| you know if the board feels strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| that we want to hear from the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| from Mr. Scott| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| or the folks from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| Chattanooga Prep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| you know we could do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| at the end of the regular agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| there's not any strong opposition to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| all right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| so we will continue on at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| with our regular agenda items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| and we'll add that at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| seeing no opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5771)|
| 1:36:17| so board member superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| Ryswick and I have agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| to the addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| of consideration of a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| with River Media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| as item 8C9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| and a data sharing agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| with United Way of Greater Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| as item 8C10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| due to time sensitivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| as always we can entertain questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| and discussion as we review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| the rest of the regular session agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=5801)|
