| 0:10:37| So congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| Now, slightly less interesting, but still important stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| The Debt Obligation Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| You may recall that at our last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| I reported that a Form 0253 document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| had been included in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| and a couple of you looked a little confused about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| and justifiably so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| Turns out that I jumped the gun a little bit on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| The form I was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| is actually in this week's packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| and you should have found it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| and it's a form called CT0253.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| So in case you don't know what that means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| which I didn't, it's part of the documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| that is necessary to complete the bond issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| that you all previously approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| and which was finalized last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| So one of the requirements related to that bond closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| is that this form be provided to each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| So it is actually in your packets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| and we will also be sending it to each of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| in regular mail tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| You don't need to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| We are just fulfilling the bond closing requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=700)|

| 0:20:03| from many members of the Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| We have witnessed growing interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| in community police engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| approaches to public safety and civilian oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| We appreciate the commitment of community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| advocates, law enforcement, elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| and the city staff to ensure we continue to build trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| by prioritizing transparency and accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| And that pretty much covers my information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| so I'm gonna hand it over to Akenya.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| Thank you, Melissa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| Good evening, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| Can you hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| I can talk louder if I need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| Maybe get a little bit closer to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| We could hear Chairman Maher pretty easily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| but it's a little harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| Sorry, we're playing musical chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| We understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| Is this a little better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| Thank you all again for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| Thank you, Mayor Kim Cannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| and the members of city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| for the opportunity, first and foremost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| to serve the Police Advisory and Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| and for your continued support of PARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| I also wanna thank the members of PARC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| Rosa mentioned several of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| but of course our chairperson, Rosa Maher and Barker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| Frank Shanklin Jr., Jarrett Peru,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| Dr. Leticia Flores, Ken St. Germain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| and our newest member, Attorney Tanae Anderson-Easterly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| for their dedicated service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| Our PARC members are vigilant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| about reviewing the conduct, policies, and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| of the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| They ask questions and they critically think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| about the policies and practices of KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| and the practical impacts that that has in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| And I'm grateful to have had the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| to work with most of them as a committee member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| and now have the honor to work with them as the director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| I especially wanna thank Rosa and Ann| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| for their dedicated years of service to PARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| As Rosa mentioned, she will be rolling off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| and Ann also, they will complete their second terms this June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| and they have both been fierce advocates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| of civilian oversight, very strong promoters of PARC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| and are always engaged and focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| on the work of the committee and we really appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| and will miss both of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| and the service that they have rendered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| Rosa covered a good bit of the report for PARC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| and so I'll just spend a couple of minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| talking about some of the additional work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| that PARC does outside of the review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| and the numbers that you see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| So in addition to the complaints that were received by PARC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| and the Internal Affairs Unit cases that we reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| PARC staff participated in training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| for the Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| Recruit Classes 2020-A and B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| providing training on cultural awareness and competency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| understanding and identifying biases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| that facilitated community panels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| to engage in small group settings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| with recruits to discuss how stereotypes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| and biases impacted communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| perceptions of and experiences with law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| recruits' perceptions of and experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| and opportunities for effective engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| We also provide training on PARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| We continue as a staff to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| with the Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| and other city staff on strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| and opportunities for community engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| training and recruitment and retention of officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| and especially looking at how we can recruit a police force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| that reflects our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| As Rosa mentioned, our capacity for meeting in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| was severely limited due to the safety protocols,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| but the Executive Director along with Chairperson Marr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| virtually and when possible in person participated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| in meetings with various organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| neighborhood groups and workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| to discuss the work of PARC and hear concerns and insight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| from members of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| We continue to our relationship with NACO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| and this year because of the virtual conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| that NACO held, it provided an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| for more voter participation by PARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| So several of our members were able to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| Myself as the Executive Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| Chief Thomas and other city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| were able to participate in the training for NACO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| which is the National Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| We continue to work to build strong community relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| and look forward to as things start to open up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| having more in-person engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| but while we are still limited in those opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| we look for virtual opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| and safe in-person opportunities to engage our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| And thankfully, I appreciate members of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| for adding PARC to the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| Internal Public Safety Innovation Task Force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| as we begin to reimagine what public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| looks like in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| With that, we look forward to continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| to work with members of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| organizational partners and law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| to build trust, accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| and work toward the common goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| of safe thriving communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Again, we wanna thank Mayor Kincaid and Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| for your time this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1534)|

| 0:25:52| and I'm really proud that Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| has had civilian oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1554)|

| 0:26:37| the debt obligation report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1597)|

| 0:29:28| in supporting state legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| that would allow our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| to capture state sales tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| generated in a small area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| around the site of the proposed stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1776)|

| 0:29:44| and not generating any sales tax revenue at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1784)|

| 0:29:57| and beneficial to the Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| Just to be clear, this legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| would not divert any existing revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| and it also does not divert the 1.5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| that the state retains to support education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| and other critical functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| Also, just to be clear, this vote tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| does not commit us in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| to pursuing the stadium project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| but it does support giving us a significant financial tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| as we continue to develop a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1820)|

| 0:31:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| My name is Tim Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| The address is 311 Southwest Garber Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| I was raised in East Knoxville and East Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| and I'm very excited about the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| of this proposed project and the positive impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| that it would have on East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| as well as all of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| Therefore, I'm speaking in favor of Resolution 11A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| East Knoxville has long awaited meaningful development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| that would create jobs, replace blight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| and underutilize properties with newly activated buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| creation of new businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| and hopefully a magnificent multi-use stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| for entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| This evening, I would like to take the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| to talk about investment and development patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| of our downtown and then discuss the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| of this proposed project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| When you look at our downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| you can see how it has been beautifully revitalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| over the past 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| Gay Street is vibrant, Market Square is bustling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| Our downtown has developed in a beautiful pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| Now look at the peripheries of our downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| and what do you see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| To the north, we jump the tracks with Regas Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| with the Mews, Mews 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| We have the Mill and Mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| and then you go up Central and Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| and it continues to develop to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| To the south, we've crossed the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| with the South Waterfront development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| We've seen millions of dollars being invested in the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| To the west, we've seen the State Supreme Court site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| get redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| We've seen a $40 million investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| of what was formerly known as the Holiday Inn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| World's Fair site, which will soon become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| a new revitalized Marriott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| and not to mention the Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| To the east, what do you see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| Especially more specifically east of James White Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| you see virtually no, I won't say virtually no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| you see no new investment in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| East Knoxville deserves better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| and I believe this project will deliver for East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| Now I would like to talk a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| about the process for this proposed project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| because I've heard a few say, oh, it's going too fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| You know, in my business, and I'm a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| you can never go too fast to find facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| You know, I don't think there's a speed limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| on fact finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| So I think it's important to note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| where we are in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| and specifically what we're trying to achieve tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| This is a public-private partnership development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| Much of downtown was revitalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| through private-public partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| It would not have happened without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| As a developer, we typically create a development checklist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| which is a list of steps to achieve to evaluate a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| You know, we don't just say, oh, this is a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| You have to have steps along the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| that you achieve to get closer to evaluate the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| Tonight, let's imagine that we think it's a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| to have a multi-use stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| on the east of James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| And many cities think that it is a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| and I want to show you, one, what we have already achieved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| which I think is monumental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| thanks to some good fortune that we have in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| So let's set out to develop a checklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| Typically, the first two, if you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| I don't know if you can see this or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| but I developed a little checklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| The first two steps are the most critical steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| of this whole checklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| We decide we want to build a multi-use stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| so we need an anchor tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Well, many cities want to recruit a sports team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| as an anchor tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| There just aren't many of those out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| Good fortune provided to Knoxville, we have Randy Boyd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| so we can check off item one to find an anchor tenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| a team willing to relocate for our multi-use stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| Let's move on to item two, find a suitable site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| We've seen many deals die| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| because you can't find a suitable site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| Often, it takes years to assemble multiple properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| for a project this big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Again, good fortune.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| Randy Boyd not only assembled the properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| but he's willing to donate the land for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| So where we are tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| we are probably closer to the beginning than we are the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| We're in what I would define as stage three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| We're devising a financing plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| So we're asking the state to define a district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| that will allow us to capture revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| to help pay for this state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| new revenues to help pay for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| And then I would say that we have probably two more steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| Mr. Hill, your time has expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| Can I just wrap up quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| Five seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| So then we've got provide community input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| and governmental approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| So let me just say that tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| we are only voting on a piece of the puzzle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| so that we can better evaluate this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| Sorry, I'll give advance notice before the end of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| My apologies, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| Next person signed up to speak in favor of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| is Hanson Sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| Mr. Sale, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2231)|
| 0:37:11| If you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| Hanson Sale, 609 Wise Scarborough Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| Good evening, Mayor Kincannon and council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| I'm here tonight speaking in my capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| as the governmental affairs director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| for the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| We represent more than 5,000 members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| involved in all aspects of residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| and commercial real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| So we believe our voice is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| and the voice of the community is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| CARS board of directors voted overwhelmingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| to support the special tax district legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| referenced in the resolution before you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| I think it's important to reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| that your vote on this resolution tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| is not for or against a stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| Rather, it is ensuring that both administrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| and those involved in the negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| are equipped with the tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| and the funding mechanisms necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| to continue the conversation and thus move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| with a formal proposal for your consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| To put this conversation into perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| in 2020, we've seen record high demand for housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| and record low supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| Knoxville was ranked number 32| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| on Realtor.com's list of top housing markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| Tennessee was number one on U-Haul's annual list of states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| that the most Americans moved to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| Redfin ranked Knoxville number 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| in the all of the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| for the largest net domestic migration, so new residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| This rise in demand is why the housing inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| in Knoxville is down 62% the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| In January, for the first time in at least two decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| the month supply fell below one month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| and the median home sales price rose 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| So the housing inventory is at a historic low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| And so when you look at this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| and making sure that we continue to have the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| is so important because along with it comes housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| There's a lot of opportunities here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| And it's important to remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| that you're not voting about that stadium tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| This is about enabling a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| This is the opportunity to reduce vacant and blighted land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| increasing housing units near public transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| broadening local employment opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| And most importantly, in our opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| is concentrating public investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| right next to existing affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| That is the model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| That's how we create communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| that propel people economically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| and create positive economic mobility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| And so we feel it's important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| the realtors feel it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| that we continue this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| And that's why our board of directors voted in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| of supporting this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| and also the legislation at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| And one other point to make is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| most cities build stadiums without a committed tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| or the certainty that private development will follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| We're not in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| And so at the very least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| we should continue to have the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| And that's why I came before you tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| to let you know of our support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| for this resolution and the state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| Thank you so much, Mr. Sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| The next person signed up to speak in favor of this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| is Jeff Tauman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| Mr. Tauman, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| I am indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Do you copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| Yes, we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| If you can start by stating your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| My name is Jeff Tauman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| I live nearby in the 4th and Gill neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| at 616 Luttrell Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| And I come to this full-throated support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| for this project with some history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| We paid attention to the baseball stadium discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| in the Bill Meyer Stadium 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| It was one of the great failures of imagination in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| We allowed baseball and urban game to flee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| and to head up to the interchange in Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| A black leadership was AWOL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| It had a huge impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| The loss of baseball was really a huge negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| that people did not wanna be in Center City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| and East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| And so the failure of imagination was across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| I know Mayor Ash got a lot of heat for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| but I think it was a total failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| Anyway, here's a historical opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| to fill in a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| where there's no obvious competing use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| I will support what citizen Tim Hill just cited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| in terms of some of the development patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| Like I say, I live in 4th and Gill nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| We've worked hard to repair the wound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| that was created by the interstate 50 or 60 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| and a whole series of really dubious anti-urban decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| that were made over the course of the decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| This is a chance for repair and to fill in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| in a historic and terrific way in my view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| I think the discussion is in some ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| maybe top heavy about baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| And I think that it's really about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| everything else around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| I'm not a fan boy for sports stadiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| I come to sports stadium construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| with a lot of skepticism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| In many cases, they're a shakedown of working men and women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| by out of town sports owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| who basically get their business address subsidized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| by working people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| And I don't like that model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| One of the things I love about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| is the fact that it is a balanced approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| I'm a huge fan of Randy Boyd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| and I don't think he gets enough credit in my view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| Look at the public spiritedness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| the support for public gardens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| the support for the revitalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| of the building adjacent to the Blunt Mansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| and on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| And as a chief executive of a public university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| I just have an instinctive sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| that he knows what a fair ask of a community is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| being mindful of stewardship of scarce public dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| Randy Boyd is gold in my view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| So there's not only a what to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| but there's a who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| and I'm a huge fan of our fellow citizen, Randy Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| So I think this is a huge opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| to create dynamics in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| economically, employment, jumpstart the McClung site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| that's sitting over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| an entire zip code of housing opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| that's begging for some action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| And to essentially create the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| what we've done with the James White Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| and other big projects over the decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| we have constrained ourself in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| that I find is really pretty amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| If you look at pictures of Knoxville in the 30s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| you'll see a big sprawling rock and Southern American city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| And somehow we got to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| where we constrained ourselves within 20 square blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| I don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| Here's an opportunity to leap the firewall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| and kick out of the concrete necktie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| that's basically constrained our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| This is really not about baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| I commend you mayor, staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| and council for shepherding this project to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| I've served with Lynn Fugate on nine counties, one vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| I've been up more blue ribbon seances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| about how to revitalize our town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| One minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| I see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| This is a really an historic generational opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| And again, it's not about baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| There's only 70 days of baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| And so if we're gonna make this commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| this thing has to pay dividends, not just for the 70 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| but every other day, every other minute of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| That's the stewardship and duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| to the citizens of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| And I think that can be had with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| And the other thing that I think is hard to quantify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| is the branding opportunity for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| Knoxville is a great sports town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| And I think this is, it's not why you do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| but it is one of those intangibles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| that can really be huge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| as we contemplate the next generation for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| So I thank you for your work on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| and I'm excited about the possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| Mr. Talman, next person that we have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| and I'll let the people speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| sign up to speak against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| The first person is Mr. Eric Wiader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing your name, Mr. Wiader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| Are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| No worries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Can you hear me, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| And if you could start by stating your name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| which I'll listen to closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| and then state your address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| and you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| Sure, it's Eric Wiader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| 205 Chester Avenue in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| Again, thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| What is being considered is a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| on state legislation that would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| or what we're being told is this is a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| on state legislation that would create an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| However, it's been made explicitly clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| that without the state legislation passing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| the current proposal would not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| So your vote tonight is not to consider another option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| but to support the advancement of the current plan forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| So what does your vote mean tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| It means you support taxpayer money being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| to fund the baseball stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| instead of that money being used for Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| community safety, and essential community services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| The current legislation's taxing district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| does include existing businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| and future revenue growth from those businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| including businesses that opened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| before the stadium is finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| Those tax dollars will go to fund the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| and not education, public health, and community safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| And just to be clear, if you read the legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| it does refer to excess revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| with the cutoff being the fiscal year 19 to June 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| So even as of now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| if an existing business's sales are up from that year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| those revenues would go towards the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| not the other essential community services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| While the new development will require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| additional expenditures from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| all of the new revenue from it will go to the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| instead of funding Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| If someone eats at a restaurant inside the new district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| instead of outside of the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| those taxes will not be utilized for education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| public health, or community safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| Under the current language of the legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| it also means you support state and local tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| going to a potential minor league baseball stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| in Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| Rumor has it that Chattanooga will be possibly included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| in this state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| Some people have suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| that the size of the district will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| As a city council member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| why would you wanna vote in support of state legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| that may likely change or deal with other counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| Why support legislation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| Yeah, so for instance, Shelby County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| or the county that Chattanooga's in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| or vote in support of legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| if you've not read the actual language of the bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| the summary in relation to the bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| or the state's fiscal note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| which in the state's fiscal note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| it'll explain how the sales tax would work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| including redirecting sales taxes from existing businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| and any businesses that opened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| prior to the stadium being completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| Another concern to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| is how the state will fund their portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| Has any guarantees been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| that the state taxes going to the baseball stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| will not result in less money from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| in other areas such as infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| For instance, if the state ends up losing out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| on 750,000 in sales taxes to fund the baseball stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| does that mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| or does that mean to make this financially work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| for the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| Will they reduce 750,000 in another area of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| for Knox County or the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| If you do not have the answer for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| or you have not received that guarantee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| then why vote on this tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| You know, this whole process from the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| since December and the creation of the Sports Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| there's been a rush in the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| The Smokies do not have to break their lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| in Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| There's time to study this issue more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| There's also time to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| how this state legislation develops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| And there's also time to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| if this is something that the community wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| You know, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| when asking for up to $85 million from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| when you consider the cost of the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| plus the infrastructure around the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| You know-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| 30 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| Sure, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| What the community wants should have been the first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| when you consider how much money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| that we're considering here in public expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| And again, I wanna thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| for allowing me the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| Thank you, Mr. Weider, Weider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| Mr. Charles Albawi has signed up to speak next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| Mr. Albawi, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| Yes, Mayor Kincannon, I am, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| Okay, if you could start by saying your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| and maybe increase your volume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| it's a little hard to hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| You have, you can go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| My name is Charles Albawi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| I live at 1111 Texas Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| Can y'all hear me all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| There's a lot to unpack here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| I just wanna say this is not a stand against Mr. Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| This is not a stand against baseball in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| Nobody has a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| The concern here is the push by county and city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3149)|
| 0:52:35| and state legislative officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| for public funding for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| The real issue in that is what's the quality of the jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3162)|
| 0:52:49| What's the pay of the jobs gonna be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| We see the hiring fair that they have for the Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| It's in the local media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| It's seasonal work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| They put it out every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| The construction jobs are temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| How many of them are gonna be a standard wage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| that amounts to the average cost of living in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| Those are questions that need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| Now, the city can work with legislatures to get money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| and create a little fiefdom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| for somebody to collect the tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| for their personal development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| But are we working with the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| to make sure that we have proper funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| for social services for the unhoused?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| Are we working with them so we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| to keep sweeping up black stock camps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| No, but we will work with them for the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| for the baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| That's a really interesting thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| It's frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| The another thing that hits me in terms of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| I mean, how many people can ask for $65 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| from the city and be put on the agenda for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| If I asked for $10 million, $5 million even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| to develop Tennessee Avenue in Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| and put up some of the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| that used to exist in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| What about a movie theater, a pool hall, a restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| All of those used to exist in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| Tennessee Avenue has vacant spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| It has buildings that need to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| Can I ask for that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| I mean, I create jobs too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| and good paying jobs that aren't seasonal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| that aren't temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| And what about the stadium when it's winter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| How's it gonna be used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| How much money are you gonna bring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| to use an outdoor baseball stadium in the winter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| What about when it rains?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| What are you gonna do for all your concerts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| when Drake comes and performs in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| at the baseball stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| Where is he gonna perform when it rains out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| I mean, those are legitimate questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| Again, the main point here is this legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| is designed for counties over 400,000 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| How many counties does that account for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| That's three counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| That's Nashville, that's Shelby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| or Davidson, excuse me, Shelby, and Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| Apparently they may have to adjust it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| to include Hamilton County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| so Chattanooga can get their stadium as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| But what about the rest of Tennesseans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| What about the legislation that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| to increase their economic development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| How many ordinances and resolutions are you passing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| to help the average Knox County or Knoxville citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| get and secure funding for anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| How often are you working with the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| to, or with other cities and counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| against the preemption laws that limit your ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| as a local government to run your government effectively?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| Like all of these are things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| that could be addressed prior to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| But the fact that you're able and willing to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| on a baseball stadium during an election year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| mind you for half of y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| 50 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| Shows us what your priorities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| I'm not saying that you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| It's just an interesting thing to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| to see, and to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| I mean, all I think about is wordplay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| Wordplay is fun and games until it's used by politicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| and then it's poisonous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| But luckily the anecdote is in the venom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| and I'm a jurist doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| I am trained to cure these inefficiencies of words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3403)|
| 0:56:51| So I encourage the people to reach out to the movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| and ask what they can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| to address this issue more effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| Thank you, Mr. Albowery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| Next person who signed up to speak against this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| is Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| Mr. Givens, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| Tyler Givens, you're on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| If you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| and you have up to five minutes to speak to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| My name is Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| I reside at 1823 Explorer Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| And a quick note, I can see the clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| so there's no need for a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| Up to this point, the mayor and the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| have been able to deflect saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| oh, it's just the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| We're just exploring possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| We're not committed to the stadium yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| We're seeking community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| And you'll note that the mayor and the speakers in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| are still taking that tact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| However, this resolution is not a planning resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| This is you all voting to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| the exact part of the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| that so many people are against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| taking tax dollars from public services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| and transferring that wealth directly to a bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| and more or less to Mr. Randy Boyd himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| The idea that revenue generated in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| is going to be entirely new is a fallacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| We already have parks and a convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| that loses money and many high quality concert venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| This facility is just gonna take away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| from what we're already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| the business already occurring at those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| Why doesn't already rich white dude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| get a special tax zone for his properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| to help pay off his city-backed mortgage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| on his business's new facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| Why don't the folks around Austin East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| get a special zone to designate their sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| and use taxes to their school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| Why don't the folks along the rivers and creeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| get a special tax zone for environmental cleanup?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| Why doesn't every business owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| get a city-backed mortgage on their new structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| and a special tax zone to pay off that mortgage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| We've got realtors and developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| supporting the stadium tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| Where are the working people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| I'm also confused about why the city government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| is directing state legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| I thought those people were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| I thought they were elected by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| Why are you using your elevated platform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| to speak louder than the people you claim to represent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| Did we have some kind of a referendum that I missed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| This stadium nonsense is incredibly frustrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| and flies in the face of decades of research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| proving that these kinds of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| cost cities millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| for little if any actual public benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| And if so many people are already moving here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| that housing prices are up 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| why do we need to build a stadium to attract more people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| We need housing for working people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| not a new stadium for an already wealthy landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| So I would like to ask the council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| to please vote against this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| or at least make a motion to delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| And if possible, I would like to yield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| my remaining two and a half minutes to the fourth speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| Council members, your rules say three pro and three con.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| If you wish to allow a fourth speaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| you can vote on it if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| I'll vote for the fourth speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| We have a motion to allow the fourth speaker to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3611)|
| 1:00:11| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| Council Member Parker seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| Any further discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| Do we need to, Mr. Johnson, do we have to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3625)|
| 1:00:25| There's no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| It can be by unanimous consent, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| It looks like there's unanimous consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| to allow the fourth speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| The next person who signed up to speak against this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| is Aaron Sweeney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| Sorry, Mayor, just real fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| I think it's important that if there's somebody in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| the fourth person, that they'd be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| There's only three people signed up in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| And then four against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| And just four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| So, Mr. Sweeney, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| Mayor, she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| How much time are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| I mean, my impression is just we'll just start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| give her a full, you know, up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| She doesn't have to use all five, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3660)|
| 1:01:01| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| Ms. Sweeney, if you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| and you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| Hi, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| My name is Aaron Sweeney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| I live at 114 South Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| I just wanted to say a few words on this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| since there's a lot of concern among everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| I've talked to in Knoxville regarding this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| Firstly, I'd like to speak as a taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| and say I'm disappointed that the city's choosing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| to allocate funds for a private enterprise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| rather than one of the many other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| where such a large investment is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| According to all the studies I've read on the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| it's clear there's a really small chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| that the stadium will actually generate enough revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| to be justified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| It seems unnecessary to me to build this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| when it's so unlikely to benefit residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| of the adjacent neighborhoods, Knoxville visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| or the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| Considering the current economic state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| I think this is particularly relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| Inevitable future pandemics are gonna happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| continued economic downturn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| and not to mention the lack of precedence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| for urban renewal actually helping working people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| All these things seem to be brushed aside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| and we've only really heard from people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| who will make money off of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| until just a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| People are struggling right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| A lot of people are struggling right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| And at best, it's irresponsible to waste money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| on something that most people can't even afford to enjoy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| especially when our money, time, energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| could very well have gone into something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| that could benefit us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| As an old city resident as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| I'm especially alarmed to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| that there's been such little thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| put into the many glaring issues that this will cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| I know I speak for many of us when I say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| that the noise and the traffic are major concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| as well as safety and environmental impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| It's wildly unsustainable, especially being in a valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3782)|
| 1:03:10| to increase this pollution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| especially on top of being potentially hazardous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| to attract more car traffic downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| It will be a public health issue, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| for the foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| More cars also pose a bigger risk to pedestrians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| as anyone who's ever walked their dog downtown will tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| Additionally, a lot of us old city residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| are recent graduates and young professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| who stayed in Knoxville because we love this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| and we love living down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| We're worried this will drive up prices even more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| which honestly feels like a slap in the face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| since it's already so unaffordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| And we're the ones who spend the most money downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| Our opinions should be taken into consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| and frankly, it's a little unnerving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| to see all of you all through your inaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| causing harm to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| and especially the houses folks in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| as well as just to scam all of Knoxvillians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| out of our own money without our input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| People are talking about this in the media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| especially like it's a done deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| as if elected officials have no power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| or no interest in protecting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| You're pushing the state legislator to approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| and shifting blame to the sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| but I'm simply asking you to deny this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| so that the developers can't so easily force their scheme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| into fruition without considering those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| that'll negatively impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| The people of Knoxville don't want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| The auxiliary uses of the proposed stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| are things we already have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| like our beautiful parks and venues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| and stadiums for other sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| A baseball stadium has failed here once before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| a baseball stadium has failed here once before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| and it will happen again if you let this go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| I yield the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| Thank you guys so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3899)|
| 1:05:06| Thank you, Ms. Sweeney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| Council members, that concludes all the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| who signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| Just a couple items of information I wanna share with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| in case there was some misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| We've already had a few meetings to get input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| from the public, neighborhood groups, business groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| others, and many more are planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| including one coming up on March 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| I can't remember, that's gonna be open to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| and live streamed, and that's just one of many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| As several people have alluded, we're at the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| I know people may disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| but we're at the beginning of this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| and this is just one further step in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| Another thing that some people have mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| is how this would impact schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| You all, I'm sure, are aware that I'm strongly committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| to our public schools, was PTA president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| of an elementary school in our public schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| on the project grad board, on the school board chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| for 10 years, and I would never do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| that I thought would undermine the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| of our public schools or our community, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| So this, I said in my opening remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| but just wanted to reiterate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| this does not take any money away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| from existing revenues for schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| and even any additional incremental revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| the state portion that is attributed to schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| and infrastructure would continue to stay that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| Also, as you all know from our meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| with our local delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| we work with our delegation on all kinds of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| We are a complex, large city and you guys deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| with issues all the time of public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| public health, housing, and public investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| in something like a mixed use public stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| So we can do many things and I'm proud that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| Another thing I just wanted to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| is something I'm really grateful for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| is unlike some other proposals in other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| or at other times in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| we have the benefit of Austin Homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| already being redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| That's a $95.5 million investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| including over $13 million that you all have approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| at the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| That's gonna increase the number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| at the Austin Homes site from 129 units to 368 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| all a few blocks away from the proposed site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| And that's gonna have fully subsidized units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| along with workforce housing and mixed income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| The Affordable Rental Development Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| has also invested not just in Austin Homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| but adding 64 units to permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| over at Caswell Manor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| And many of you were able to attend the groundbreaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| at the Fourth Purpose Foundation's Dogen Gaither Flats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| Those are city investments in affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| and supportive housing all in this part of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| which I'm really proud of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| and I think speaks to the complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| and well-suited area for this redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| And if you've had a chance to go down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| which I know you probably all have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| it is blighted area right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| There's not active safe part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| And I think the other point I'll just make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| is that this is just saying that we support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| the legislation that would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| for another way of helping with the financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| So without, I'll end my remarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| and let you all ask any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| or make any comments you may wish to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4130)|
| 1:08:59| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| Council Member Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| I think we should clarify the intent of the legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| because there has been some, I guess, disagreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| in how to interpret that piece of legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| So I just wanted to use one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| The way that I read the legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| is that since it covers a quarter square mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| there is a store that is just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| and currently there are sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| from outside of the state's 1.5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4176)|
| 1:09:42| that go towards Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| and other social services from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| just as an example, those in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| But once, if this legislation passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| that business, as one example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| one where the current taxes dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4201)|
| 1:10:06| to social services in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| would be then diverted to the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| And my concern is, with the underfunding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4213)|
| 1:10:21| that currently occurs with education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| and other social services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| we really can't afford even $1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| that was previously dedicated to our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| to be diverted away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| So I wanted to use Weigel's as one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| Can we do, I don't know if that's, Director, well-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| Deputy Ross, if you could speak to that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| So the way the legislation is written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| actually, the existing sales tax would not be diverted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| So the idea is that we're looking to capture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| incremental increase in sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| that we feel would be largely driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| by additional economic investment in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| So there are parcels, and we recognize that in this zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| that are already generating sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| And the intent of the legislation, not just the intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4281)|
| 1:11:27| but the way that the legislation is written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| that existing sales tax revenue would continue to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| to the places it currently goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| This is a common practice in these zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| So you have your base amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| and then whatever the increase is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| is what is captured to help address the debt on the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| And the base amount, so just at Weigel's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| the base amount has been set as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| looking at fiscal year 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| Yes, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| So let me just also add, however, that this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| just as with many pieces of legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| there are amendments that are made along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| And this particular issue that you're raising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| is an issue that's being addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| through a possible amendment, potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| and probable actually, amendments of the legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| where properties that are generating significant sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4347)|
| 1:12:33| say $5,000 or more in sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| would be carved out of the district altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| And we've actually have a draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| a new draft of the legislation that just carves out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| anything that goes beyond $5,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| in current sales tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| I think that should clear it up for folks, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| But what I'm hearing is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| until the amendment is applied to the legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| as currently written, sales taxes from current businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4381)|
| 1:13:07| above fiscal 2020 amounts would go towards the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4387)|
| 1:13:13| rather than to what they currently go towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| So Council Member Parker, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| just to address your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| there is a base amount of sales tax that is identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| And yes, there's a fiscal year that's attached to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| And right now we're looking at fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| that's ending June 2020, July 1st, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4411)|
| 1:13:37| And that would be the base amount of sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| However, as I explained, we are also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| a draft amendment is already out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| that is carving out those parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| that generate more than $5,000 of sales tax per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4430)|
| 1:13:57| So I just wanted to say that's the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| why I'm not in support of this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| or the legislation as currently written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| And it would be my recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| that Council postpone this agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| and reconsider perhaps once an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| is attached to the legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| so that we're not confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| about what legislation we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| Ms. Rider, your hand was raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| Yeah, I appreciate Councilwoman Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| sorry, my own name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| Anyway, Councilwoman Parker clarifying some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| I've also gotten a lot of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| about what exactly would be taxed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| and what is included in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| because there seems to be a lot of confusion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| Ms. Welch, is there the potential for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| to get a map for which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| because in my questions to get clarification on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| my understanding is it is things that don't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| It's not just, so make sure I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| it's not just about the base sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| for fiscal year 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| it's about taxing popcorn tickets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| whatever other sales at the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| and in addition, the developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| that is to be built as a partnership with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| So thank you, Councilwoman Rider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| So two pieces there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| Existing legislation exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| There's a state law right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| that enables the collection of sales tax inside the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| if the stadium is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| And so we can all presume if there is no stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| there is no sales tax inside the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| So if the stadium is built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| then all of the sales tax generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| inside the stadium would be new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| and that would include all the things you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| popcorn, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| And then what this, so that's existing law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| and there are communities all over the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| that are already taking advantage of that existing law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| and actually the legislation that we're proposing as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| which is to expand that district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| to include property in that quarter mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| and I'll get back to your question about the map also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| because I think that's also a really good question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| but expanding that district outside the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| to a quarter mile from the center point of the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| which would include what's largely either underdeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| or undeveloped property included right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| There are existing businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| and we acknowledge that in the legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| by saying that we don't wanna take away sales tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| that is already being generated by existing businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| So let's set a baseline and only go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| and grab the increment above that baseline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| However, the concerns that are being expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| and that you've heard from colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| and community members, we've heard that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| and so an amendment has been drafted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| to remove those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| that generate more than $5,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| I would just say that anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| who follows state legislative process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| there are amendments that are made along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| oftentimes with legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| So even this amendment could be further amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| by the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| So to get to your question about the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| so there is a, you all have at some point seen a map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| that's a quarter mile map around the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| for a parking study that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| That's what we're using to get a general idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| of the property that's in that quarter mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| And I don't mean to get complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| but just to think about where we are in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| we don't have a final site plan for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| We can't get a final site plan for the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| until we decide whether we're gonna build the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| And so to have a quarter mile radius| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| from the center point of the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| in any type of precise manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| would be challenging at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| We have a rough idea from that parking map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| and I'd be happy to share that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| that's then in the public realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| So if it would be helpful for everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| to look at that again, I can send that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| It has a sort of a rough idea of what a quarter mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| around the stadium looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| Also real quickly, there's also the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| of the CBID tax district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| which pays for the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| This tax district cannot overlap that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| So that puts limitations on where this can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4731)|
| 1:18:51| And I think a lot of people who are asking questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| aren't familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| And you may not know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| and maybe it's a question to answer for later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| but in my time on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| I thought that the CBID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| that the payments for the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| were scheduled to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| were on schedule to pay it off about five years in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| earlier than initially planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| And that may be something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| I know that we've been looking at that district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| and the stadium that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| and that may be something that Ms. Juneau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| would be able to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| unless we can get back to you as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| which whichever way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| So let me tack on that for Ms. Juneau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| because I'm going to assume that she's on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4772)|
| 1:19:33| I think we need clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| And then also clarity for the public and for ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| that when that note is paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| and that district is resolved or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| that those revenues then start going to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| and not to the convention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| whatever revenues were going to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| for the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| So that's a question for a future time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| I want clarification also on the March 25th date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| that Mayor Kincaid just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| So there's a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| because I'm getting a lot of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| and this is one of my comments to Ms. Welch was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4809)|
| 1:20:16| there are constituents that feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| there's an information step missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| A lot of the information is coming from the media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| and not from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| And so I feel like we need to have meetings to say like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4827)|
| 1:20:31| this is the proposal, we're considering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| And that part of the process is missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| And I feel like part of that may be more difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| because of COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4842)|
| 1:20:42| but I think it's really critical and important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| Yeah, I just looked it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| and correct me if I'm wrong, Ms. Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| March 25th, 6 p.m. open community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4852)|
| 1:20:56| I mean, it's gonna be by Zoom because of the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| but it'll be open to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| And it's not the first meeting, it's not the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| but it will be another opportunity for us to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| what we know, which we don't know everything yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| but it'll be able to share what we do know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| and get input from the community at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| Ms. Welch, I don't know if there's any further details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| about that meeting that we have ready now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| That's all I know is the date and time in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| For now, we're still doing things by Zoom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| for all the reasons you all are familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| Yeah, well, we can get the details out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| It was coordinating schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| Both of the mayors are gonna be participating in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| as well as myself, Mr. Caldwell, and Mr. Mamentoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| It just took a little bit to get all of our schedules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| We were able to nail that down today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| and we'll get details out to council and to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| We're setting up a lot of meetings right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| with business and professional organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| neighborhood organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| but we realized we need an open venue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4916)|
| 1:21:57| for anyone who's interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| And so there'll be opportunity for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| Okay, and if I could just ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| and then I'll be quiet and pass the torch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| for there to be an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| like if there's a website for submission of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| or comments as part of that meeting or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| Thank you, Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| Ms. Fugate, were you, I don't, you're unmuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4942)|
| 1:22:22| Mr. Roberto, I can't, now you're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| Yeah, yeah, go to Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| I was getting ready to raise my hand, but he beat me to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| Okay, we'll go with Councilman Roberto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| and then to Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| Thank you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| I think one part of this that is helpful for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| to try to understand what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| but then I think might be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| for those that are watching at home as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| is just how does the revenue generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| from sales work today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| So just not even thinking about this option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| for potential option for funding a stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| So I don't know who to direct this to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| but it could be Director Juneau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| it could be Deputy Mayor Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| could be Mr. Mametoff, he's on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| Well, I think our CFO, Susan Juneau, is on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| Well, so as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| if today someone was to spend $100,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5002)|
| 1:23:27| there would be $9.25 of revenue associated with that sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| Of that $9.25, $7 of that would go to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5013)|
| 1:23:39| and $2.25 of that would go to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| Of that $2.25 that goes to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5024)|
| 1:23:48| 72% would go to Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| and 28% would go to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| Is that correct, Director Juneau?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| That is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| When you reference the $2.25 for the local option piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5041)|
| 1:24:08| just as an addendum, we don't get that full amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| The county trustee takes the school portion off the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| but yes, your calculation is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| And by my calculations and looking at that here recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5060)|
| 1:24:26| that 72% in 2020 would have been approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| $116 million going to Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| I don't know if you have those numbers in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| but in rough numbers, does that seem approximately correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| Okay, so if the finance model that's being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| was to pass, then if we think about that same $100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5088)|
| 1:24:53| within the stadium zone, which is that quarter mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5093)|
| 1:24:58| if you spend that $100, there'd be $9.25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| assessed to the revenue related to that sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| Of that, $7.75 would go to address stadium debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5107)|
| 1:25:14| and $1.50 would go to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| You're on mute, Ms. Juneau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| Okay, I just think that's helpful for me, at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| to understand what we have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| and what's being proposed within this quarter mile zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| I also think, you know, another important question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| I think Deputy Mayor Welch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| and some of the other questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| have kind of centered around this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| but this is not about existing revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| that's generated in this quarter mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| This is about incremental increase in revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| in that quarter mile proposed zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5156)|
| 1:26:00| Just making sure that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5163)|
| 1:26:04| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5164)|
| 1:26:05| Okay, and I don't know if this is a better question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| for all of us, but I think it's a good question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| if this is a better question for Deputy Mayor Welch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| or anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| But is there any anticipation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| that Knox County Schools will get less revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5182)|
| 1:26:26| given if this finance option was employed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| I'm happy to answer that question, Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| And no, there is no anticipation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| that the tax revenue would be less for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| And I would say that actually the anticipation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| is that sales tax revenue will go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| And I can kind of walk you through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| what that might look like if that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| Yeah, please, please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| So it might be helpful to just think of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| you know, as right now there's a stadium in Sevier County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| that attracts somewhere between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| four and 5,000 fans per game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| I was just speaking with one of my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| and friends a couple of weeks ago about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| She and her husband and her two children go to those games,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| not all of them, but they go to a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| And if it's on a Friday or Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| she told me, you know, they'll go up a little bit early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| they'll stop into the Bass Pro Shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| spend some money on some outdoor gear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| go to the Chop House, grab some dinner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| head over to the stadium, enjoy the game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| have some popcorn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| And so she's telling me, you know, this will be great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| because I can go to the game in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| and I can stop at Mass General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| and I can pick up some outdoor gear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| and I can head over to the Downtown Grill and Brewery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| and grab dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| And so those would be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| multiply that times the number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| And of course, they're not all shopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| and eating in Knoxville when they come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| Some of them might just go to the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| But we would foresee that not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| would that additional revenue be coming into our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| some of it inside the tax allocation district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| around the stadium, but a lot of it not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| I mean, it would be people visiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| other places in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| So what we would foresee is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| that immediate economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| And just so that you know, that story is a story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5306)|
| 1:28:30| And I understand there could be lots of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| about that, but we are also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| we have, we're going to be securing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| we have an RFP out right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| to get a consultant on board to do a third party review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| of all of the economic impact data so that we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| again, it's one more piece of our financing puzzle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| to make sure that we can be certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| that this is a good financial deal or not for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| I hope that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| No, that's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5342)|
| 1:29:03| Those, I guess the questions I just asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5343)|
| 1:29:07| are a lot of the community input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| that I've been hearing in questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| And I think there was a lot of confusion about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| or just not understanding fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| how revenue from sales works right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5355)|
| 1:29:20| and then how it would look in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| But then also just, you know, is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| is this new and it's the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| it's just the allocation is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| And so anyway, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| Thank you, Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| So just to reiterate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| this financing structure was used for the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| It did increase, the convention center created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| a lot more economic impact in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| and we've benefited from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| with increased sales tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| So the theory is that this will do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| My question, and I believe it will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| but it's not a theory, we've actually seen that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| So my question is, in terms of timeframe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| how long is the legislature expected to be in session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| Don't they typically end April or May?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| They're supposed to end by late April, early May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| Yeah, I think that-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| Late April, early May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| we would anticipate this being heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| Late April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| And that's why I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| it is incumbent upon City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| to go ahead and move on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| County Commission has already approved this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| I don't think our legislators represent our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5438)|
| 1:30:44| that they would like some reassurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| not that we're gonna build the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| but that we want them to at least explore this option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| as a means to finance this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| so that we can consider the proposal in its entirety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| and then come back with how we could finance it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| So I think that's why we cannot wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| And amendments move 10 minutes on the floor of the House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| or the floor of the Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| I don't think we can know exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| what amendments might be put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| So I think we'll have to trust our representatives on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| I intend to support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| because I do believe the community has questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| but I don't believe everybody in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| is against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5489)|
| 1:31:30| I keep hearing people say the community doesn't want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| Well, the city is a large city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| and I hear from lots of people that are excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| about having this amenity back in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| So I fully think we need to continue exploring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| whether this is a good thing for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| So I intend to support the resolution tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| I will go to Vice Mayor McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| and then Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| And my question is to Deputy Chief Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| So in the event that this does pass in the House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5521)|
| 1:32:06| and in the event that a stadium is not approved or built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5526)|
| 1:32:10| what would that mean for us as a city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| Would there be no impact at all to us as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| if the stadium is not approved and built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| but yet this passes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| So with the, thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| If the legislation passes and then a decision is made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| not to move forward with the stadium project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| then this district doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| I mean, there's no impact of the legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5552)|
| 1:32:40| Let's say hypothetically, if housing or something like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| let's say some condos were built on that land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| would that still mean that that district would be intact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| or is it solely tied to this particular project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5570)|
| 1:32:55| This legislation is tied to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| It's very specific to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| because the legislation that ties sales tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| to a stadium is specific to stadiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| And then the expansion is specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| to that legislation and stadiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| So there are other tools potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5591)|
| 1:33:16| particularly for things like affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| but not, this district would not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5603)|
| 1:33:23| I just needed that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5610)|
| 1:33:30| And Vice Mayor just asked one of my two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| The second question that I had was just to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| if the incremental revenues associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| with this tax structure allow us to pay off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| the prospective stadium debt early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| can you just confirm again that those tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| once a stadium is paid for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| at least the debt flows through our natural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| our existing tax structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5638)|
| 1:33:59| as outlined by Council Member Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| So the legislation is specifically tied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| to stadium debt construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| Let's see, that service related to the financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| and construction of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| So if there's no debt related to the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| then those revenues just go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| into our regular revenue stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| for city, county, state, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| I just wanted to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| Just wanted to emphasize again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| the importance of having the impact studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5678)|
| 1:34:42| before we make these types of decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| because some of the studies that have come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| regarding the economic impact of minor league stadiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| on a city have shown that often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| it doesn't bring in new revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| Revenue that was traditionally coming into the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| in one part of town just shifts to another part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| So the folks who were recreating part of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| are now engaged in activities at the baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| So it's kind of clear to us how many of the fans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5715)|
| 1:35:21| from Sevier County are gonna travel here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| Is it gonna be a significant amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| We're hearing mixed things about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| It's only a different, it's a different experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| where the current field is versus downtown experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5736)|
| 1:35:41| the stadium would bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| So I think that's an important conversation to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| And the other just point that I'll make is usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5748)|
| 1:35:53| we present asking state legislators to take a nap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5753)|
| 1:35:59| It's very, you know, we go through and hide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5759)|
| 1:36:04| whether it's the legislation that we support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| or specific things that we wanna see in the legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| And it makes me uncomfortable also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| that the city council would make a blanket statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5774)|
| 1:36:19| that we support any of legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5779)|
| 1:36:23| that creates this special tax district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| Either this amendment is included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| on the current legislation that is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5789)|
| 1:36:36| See any harm and in openness for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| so that we can have a resolution that is more specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| and really captures, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| what was discussed council member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| the more time and opportunity to engage the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| and those we represent, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| around this conversation regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| how the stadium be financed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| Now I've read studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| This is an issue that I essentially ran on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| when I ran for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| It was one of the first issues I discussed publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| was whether there was for a publicly financed stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| There was a resounding no individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| that I asked in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| So I did not expect this due to come to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| so quickly with very limited public engaged thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| So I would like to see the process a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| like that for us that much more in sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| Council members, I just want to reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| as Deputy Welch mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| there will be a third party outside entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| to give us an evaluation of the economic impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| this proposal would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| And I will make sure you and the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| have access to the results of that report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| before you vote on any financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| This is not a vote on the final financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| It's a vote on encouraging the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| to consider this other tool that would be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| as part of the financing proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| But it's just, so that market study will be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5900)|
| 1:38:25| before you vote on the financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| I just wanted to share with everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5909)|
| 1:38:33| if you map and you go on KGIS and use the measurement tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| James White Parkway and Hall of Fame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| which buffer where the stadium is gonna go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| that's a 10th of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| And then besides that, you keep going out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| is an empty parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| So the quarter mile from the center of the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| puts you across roads that can't possibly produce revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5932)|
| 1:38:58| So, and then the map that I was provided the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| the CVID district is up towards the intersection of central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| So, I mean, we can't capture the tax sales off of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| because they're already captured for other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| And there is nothing in the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| So I thought that was important for scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| for people to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| There's so much misinformation about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| that I'm glad we're spending some time right now, at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| And I think we need to spend a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| sorting through all of this, but the piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| well, one thing, if the stadium doesn't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| whichever way we vote on this, if the stadium happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| I would want the money to support the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| If the stadium doesn't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| there is no stadium to support, no need for the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| But the state money, I have no issue with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=5995)|
| 1:40:00| As it is, the state doesn't take in millions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| and millions of dollars that would help us in healthcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| They have millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| that they could be giving out to families in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| They don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| So the state piece, the state tax piece of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| I'm fine with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| It's the local tax that is my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6017)|
| 1:40:22| And then we get so hypothetical about all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6022)|
| 1:40:26| like the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6026)|
| 1:40:27| Thank you so much, Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| You asked some really good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| But the 116 million that went to education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6032)|
| 1:40:38| and we're saying that if the stadium is built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| well, if this resolution passes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| and then it goes through the state and passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| then if the stadium is built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| that we are saying it's not going to decrease the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| that the schools get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| What if it does is one portion of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| And then I'll come back if someone can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| That'd be welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6065)|
| 1:41:06| I'll let you, I mean, I think I have an answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| but you could probably say it in an eloquent manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| Thanks, Councilman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| I'm just trying to sort of think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| what if it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| I guess I'm trying to figure out how that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| if we're talking about any incremental increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| in sales tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| the existing sales tax revenue in the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| and on those parcels would continue to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| to the places it's going right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| So only the increase in sales tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| on those parcels and in that district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| would be utilized to fund the stadium mortgage, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6104)|
| 1:41:49| So I'm trying to imagine the decrease in school funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6109)|
| 1:41:56| and sort of how that would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| So is there any way to separate out the state piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| and the local piece, the taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| to do this quarter mile collection with state monies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| but not with local tax collection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| That's not the way the legislation is proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| and we're not proposing a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6141)|
| 1:42:26| that would split those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| I mean, is there a way to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| We would have to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6151)|
| 1:42:36| I don't think that that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6156)|
| 1:42:37| that we've even contemplated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| because again, what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| is the existing revenue that is there right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| would continue to come to the places where it's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| It would continue to go to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| It would continue to go to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| It would continue to go to all the places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| It's just the increase in revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| that doesn't currently exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| That revenue doesn't exist right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| So if nothing is developed on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| then there's no new sales tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| And if something is developed on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6190)|
| 1:43:14| then there'll be new sales tax revenue on those parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| that would go to pay the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| which has no impact to local taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6199)|
| 1:43:24| And the likelihood is that there will be increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| sales tax revenue from surrounding business activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6206)|
| 1:43:31| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| I don't know if that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| That's a pretty vague question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| So what bothers me is that if we're thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| about helping Knoxville do better and to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| and to economic development for Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| just the thought of collecting tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| and then not giving it to schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| that part bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6243)|
| 1:44:05| It doesn't seem like it assists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| But then again, this is all theoretical money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| There isn't any development right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| There's not taxes being collected right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| But if the stadium doesn't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| there will be some sort of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| What would, and once again, this is all theoretical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| what kind of tax money would we be getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| if there's development, but it's not the baseball stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6265)|
| 1:44:32| I'm sorry, do you want me to-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| I think, I mean, I sort of feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6273)|
| 1:44:34| that's a rhetorical question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| which we can't answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| because it's currently in the hands of a private owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| and they could choose to develop it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| or it's just a, that's a very abstract question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| that I don't think we can answer really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| But I just do want to reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| that what Deputy Welch said is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| this is not gonna hurt or change or reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| any of the contributions we currently make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6300)|
| 1:45:01| to Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| And I wouldn't let that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| And I do think that there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| and this is what the Economic Impact Report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| can tell us in more than just a theoretical way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| that economic development is key to improving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| our revenues as a whole that will allow us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| to contribute to affordable housing and other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| to support our social service partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| in the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| to address all those many needs that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| to address inequities and job development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6329)|
| 1:45:34| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| So Council Member Singh, if you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6335)|
| 1:45:38| when you're, there's some other council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| who have questions, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6341)|
| 1:45:42| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| Okay, I'm gonna go to Council Member Fugate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| and then Ryder and then Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| I just wanted to address Council Member Singh's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| issue about the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| The majority of school funding comes from property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| from Knox County property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| So any development, private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| that takes place on undeveloped property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| would see an increase in property tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| The increase in property tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| would go to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| So this is not an all or nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| The city actually is generous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| and gives city tax dollars to Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| The 116 million that the city gives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| I believe in round numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| the school board budget is over 450 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| Most of that comes from property tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6394)|
| 1:46:38| and some of the sales tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| that are state funding that comes back to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| So I just wanna reiterate that there will be an increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6402)|
| 1:46:47| in education funding if private development takes place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6407)|
| 1:46:51| because the stadium is there in undeveloped property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6411)|
| 1:46:57| That's not exactly the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6417)|
| 1:46:58| but it's not an all or nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| I'm trying to be helpful and that might not be helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| but that's what I know from my time on school board, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| Thank you, Council Member Fugate, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| Okay, so my understanding of what we're talking about here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| is the local option sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| that is required to go to school funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| is not touched and it still goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| So as the property sits right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| it generates no local option sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| because nothing's being sold there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| But if something is developed and it's residential only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| it will develop property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| which is what Council Member Fugate just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6461)|
| 1:47:45| But if it's a ball stadium, et cetera, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| and it generates tax revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| there's the portion that we're discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| for the capture to pay for the note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| but then there's still the local option sales tax piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6477)|
| 1:48:01| that goes to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| I will let Lynn answer that question, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| No, I was just gonna say the state sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| will also increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| which would mean that their revenues would increase as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6492)|
| 1:48:17| and that could go back to education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| Okay, so the way I see the answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| to Councilwoman Singh's question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| as it sits now, it's not producing anything for the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| outside of what it does for the minimal property tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| as blighted vacant properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| And once something's built there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6516)|
| 1:48:37| it will generate more property tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6517)|
| 1:48:42| And then if it's residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| that's all it's gonna, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| it'll go up in that value and create those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| But if it's a ball stadium or a retail outlet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| which is the $140 million development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| that's to partner with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6534)|
| 1:48:55| it will create the sales tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| a portion of which, which is what we were discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| to capture to pay for the note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6541)|
| 1:49:04| and then a portion goes to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| So I don't see how it can do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| but increase the tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| Ms. Welch, I'm gonna have Ms. Welch clarify this for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6552)|
| 1:49:15| I just wanna be really clear about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| and I'm sorry if it hasn't been clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| Here's what happens with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| Let me talk first about the existing legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| I'm sorry, I know we've been over this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| but Councilwoman Ryder, I wanna make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| based on the question you just asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| I think there's still some lack of clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| There is existing legislation that allows us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| when anybody builds a stadium in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6577)|
| 1:49:41| all of the sales tax revenue, local sales tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6581)|
| 1:49:45| state sales tax revenue, that is all new sales tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| That, all of that goes to pay for the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| except 1.5%, which the state retains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6593)|
| 1:49:59| to pay for things like education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| and other essential services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| Okay, that's the stadium itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| We're talking about expanding the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| by a quarter of a mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| so that quarter mile radius outside the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| If there's existing sales tax revenue being generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| in that district, that would not be touched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| Nothing of that existing sales tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| would be diverted or taken or changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| or moved someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| So if it's existing, it keeps going where it's going now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6630)|
| 1:50:35| If there's an increase in sales tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| above that base within that quarter mile district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6638)|
| 1:50:43| then all of that sales tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6643)|
| 1:50:46| goes to pay for the stadium debt, to finance the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| except 1.5%, which is retained by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| to pay for education and some other essential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6655)|
| 1:51:01| you know, things that they pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6661)|
| 1:51:02| So there is no effect on school sales tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| from inside the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| And I would, what preliminary economic data tells us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| is that there'll be more people spending money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| outside the district when they come to games,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6679)|
| 1:51:20| So overall sales tax revenue, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| for the schools would go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| Inside the district, that incremental increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| all of it, including the local,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| would go to finance the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| Okay, thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6694)|
| 1:51:37| No decrease in sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| The school sales tax would not be touched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| the existing revenue that's coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| So does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| We'll go to Council Member Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| and then Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| Unless the existing revenue is above and beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| fiscal year 2020 levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| which we don't know what fiscal year 2021 will look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6720)|
| 1:52:06| So I don't think that we can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6726)|
| 1:52:10| you know, that we can't consider current revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| I think that's really confusing to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| I wanted to raise three points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| If you read the fiscal note attached to the bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| there are projections for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| the state in reviewing the legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6748)|
| 1:52:32| is determining what is its potential loss in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6752)|
| 1:52:38| And so when the state is looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| they are taking into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| what new businesses may come into the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6765)|
| 1:52:48| that are not being drawn to the area because of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6768)|
| 1:52:53| They pre-exist the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6773)|
| 1:52:56| Perhaps they're, you know, they're just opening now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| or they opened right after, you know, last fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6778)|
| 1:53:04| They've made calculations and these are kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| you know, one complaint I have about the legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| and one is why the state has identified 10 businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6791)|
| 1:53:17| in the special tax district to calculate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| the potential impact on their budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| but then did not use the actual sales revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| that came from those 10 businesses in fiscal year 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6807)|
| 1:53:32| to make their calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6812)|
| 1:53:34| That doesn't make any sense to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6814)|
| 1:53:36| but I just wanted to raise it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6816)|
| 1:53:37| because Councilwoman Singh was asking about projections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6817)|
| 1:53:43| of sales tax income that could potentially come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| from new businesses that come to the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| before the stadium is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| And the state's fiscal note makes an attempt in some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6831)|
| 1:53:56| to try to address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| The other thing that I find unfortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| about the legislation and the fiscal note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| is that it says there is no projections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6842)|
| 1:54:06| currently being made for, you know, developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6846)|
| 1:54:15| Oh, I can't remember the exact wording around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| but it doesn't recognize the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6859)|
| 1:54:20| that the developer in question has already committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| to developing that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| At our last workshop, you know, Randy Boyd stated clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6865)|
| 1:54:30| that whether the stadium moves forward or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| development is moving forward on this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| I don't think that it's necessary for us to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6875)|
| 1:54:41| for fear that this will remain a blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| because we've heard from the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| that there are tools to develop the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| regardless of the cost of the property, regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| So, you know, I just see it as, oh, and the other, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6893)|
| 1:54:57| the third point is as a part of the financing package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6897)|
| 1:55:02| you know, there's a TIF or pilot being discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| for the private development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| which could impact potential tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6906)|
| 1:55:11| coming from the new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| and impacting the city budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| So again, there's just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| a lot of work that's been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| I fear ahead of this vote on the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6919)|
| 1:55:23| And I really think that we should pause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6923)|
| 1:55:26| and get more information before expressing support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6926)|
| 1:55:30| for a piece of legislation that in its current form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6930)|
| 1:55:36| doesn't fit our needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6936)|
| 1:55:39| Thank you, Council Member Parker, Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6939)|
| 1:55:43| So this has been said a couple of times tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6943)|
| 1:55:46| or, you know, we've kind of talked in and out of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| but, you know, around the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6950)|
| 1:55:55| and the proposed development within that quarter mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| I mean, we also have to remember that it's mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6957)|
| 1:56:01| it's retail, it's hundreds of proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6961)|
| 1:56:05| new residential units as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| So again, when you're talking about that type of volume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6969)|
| 1:56:13| you talk about people coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| moving to downtown, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| spending the type of revenue that they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| to be residents of downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| equals a substantial amount of new tax revenue dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6982)|
| 1:56:29| that, again, does bring more dollars to education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| does bring more dollars to the social services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| that the city does, and we all agree, desperately needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=6997)|
| 1:56:41| It also doesn't include outside that quarter mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7001)|
| 1:56:45| and the substantial development that would take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7005)|
| 1:56:49| outside that quarter mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| And, you know, again, going toward the legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| kind of like the sports authority vote that we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| we can't bring a fully conceptualized plan forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7017)|
| 1:57:03| without this legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| It's not a financial commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7025)|
| 1:57:06| but it's an order for us to put, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7026)|
| 1:57:10| the financial landscape of this project together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7030)|
| 1:57:14| and have a full, you know, idea and concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7034)|
| 1:57:18| of what the impact of the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| would really do for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| So we're so focused on the minute and this new tax history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7043)|
| 1:57:28| but it's also looking at the holistic perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7048)|
| 1:57:32| of not, you know, the new residents and also as well as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7052)|
| 1:57:36| you know, the development that will take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| outside of that quarter mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| and continue to attract new business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| But bottom line, I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| the rising tides will lift all boats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| and will create a groundswell of greater tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| that's not dedicated to the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| but instead is dedicated to, you know, education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7076)|
| 1:58:01| And again, the services that we need to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| to enhance all of the quality of life for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7084)|
| 1:58:08| So if I've missed anything, but again, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7088)|
| 1:58:12| this is just a stepping stone and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7092)|
| 1:58:15| commits us to nothing at moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| but we've got to have this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| and this legislation passed in order to move forward again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7099)|
| 1:58:23| to put this plan together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7103)|
| 1:58:26| Thank you, Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7106)|
| 1:58:29| I think you raised some good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7109)|
| 1:58:32| This resolution is asking council to ask our members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7112)|
| 1:58:36| of the General Assembly to keep locally generated tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7116)|
| 1:58:40| in a public amenity that will help bring investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7120)|
| 1:58:44| and jobs to East Knoxville and the whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7124)|
| 1:58:47| Is there any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| If not, let's go ahead and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| oh, Council Member Singh, you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| Thank you, I'm not sure with procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| I'd like to make a move to postpone this for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| Okay, Council Member Singh is moving to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| All right, motion to postpone for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| made by Council Member Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| seconded by Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| I'd like to understand the purpose of the postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| and just what types of questions we want answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7159)|
| 1:59:22| during that time that weren't answered tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| I think that would be important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7164)|
| 1:59:25| Ms. Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| I would like to talk with the two people who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7167)|
| 1:59:32| our legislators that are proposing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| to see what they have in mind as far as amendments go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7173)|
| 1:59:37| and to talk to them about the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| for me, what my interest is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| is the local sales tax option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| and seeing if we can discuss that with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7183)|
| 1:59:48| And if I may just, I think that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| But as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| this could take a few weeks in the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| So we may not know the exact words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| of the legislation for weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| So even if we were able to get their input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| over the next couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7205)|
| 2:00:06| we wouldn't know for sure for maybe a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7206)|
| 2:00:09| Is that correct, Deputy Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7209)|
| 2:00:14| So, you know, the way the legislative process works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7214)|
| 2:00:17| is that, you know, amendments are made along the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7217)|
| 2:00:20| and they can be made on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| and, you know, legislation evolves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7222)|
| 2:00:25| as it goes through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| So, yes, the legislative process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7227)|
| 2:00:32| is iterative and it's happening now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7232)|
| 2:00:35| Those discussions are happening now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| And I think, yes, hopefully that answers the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7237)|
| 2:00:43| I'd also just say that a delay may send a signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| that could be misinterpreted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7246)|
| 2:00:47| by our members of the General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| that the city doesn't want them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7249)|

| 2:01:41| Okay, now back to the original motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7301)|
| 2:01:44| to approve the resolution requesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7304)|
| 2:01:47| well, you all know what we're talking about, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| Any further questions or discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| Any further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7314)|
| 2:01:56| Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7316)|
| 2:01:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7317)|
| 2:02:00| Ms. Welch, as you know, as you recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| you and I had a pretty serious conversation yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7322)|
| 2:02:06| and my concern was about how this action by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7326)|
| 2:02:12| might result in siphoning off money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7332)|
| 2:02:18| out of existing programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| And of course, that was my big concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| and that's the concern of the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| What I gather from our discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| the proposal by the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7349)|
| 2:02:34| is designed to only capture future revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7354)|
| 2:02:40| that is driven by the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7360)|
| 2:02:46| So even if the existing program was the one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7366)|
| 2:02:50| the proposal was the one that would pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| all the existing revenue that goes into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7373)|
| 2:02:59| the public amenities that we all hold dear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7379)|
| 2:03:03| they would still be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7383)|
| 2:03:04| The only thing that would be taxed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7384)|
| 2:03:08| and diverted to the stadium would be increased revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7388)|
| 2:03:14| with the idea that we wouldn't have that revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7394)|
| 2:03:18| without the new proposed project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7398)|
| 2:03:23| driving the new development in businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7403)|
| 2:03:27| Is that, am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7407)|
| 2:03:30| And that was our conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7410)|
| 2:03:32| I think that's a good summary, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7412)|
| 2:03:35| Yeah, well, with that understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| I feel comfortable going forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7418)|
| 2:03:41| I just don't see the downside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| to siphoning off existing revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| And if we continue to explore this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7428)|
| 2:03:51| and this is not a done deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| but if we continue to explore this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| with the possibility of developing a blighted site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7436)|
