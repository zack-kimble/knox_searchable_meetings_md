| 0:03:12| in District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| Vice Mayor Becker was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| That was literally a community-led effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| We were able to join in and help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| Once the community bound together, then we helped, and they raised a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| It's just a good example of how to get things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=206)|

| 0:03:36| The goal of the meeting is to give all the interest parties a chance to review and comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| on the concept designs before we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=220)|

| 0:04:36| It really is one of the more fun days in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| I encourage everybody to be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| Reports from members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| Yes, I'd like to remind everyone of the annual festival event that's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=286)|
| 0:04:52| It's the 10th annual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=292)|

| 0:05:12| and food and craft and vendors and an art exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| Just a suggested donation of $5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| It's a great day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| I was there last year and, of course, will be there again this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| and just hope everyone will come out and enjoy South Lawnsville and Vestival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| Will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| Vestival is a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| I really like going there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| Three quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| I'm asking Ms. Mitchell to send an email out to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| to schedule the workshop we want to do on the East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| We don't have another workshop scheduled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| so technically we have everything starting April 28th on available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| My recommendation would be that we'd wait on this until after the budget finishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| Again, this is a workshop we're doing to understand the economic development policies that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=356)|
| 0:06:03| There will be an email coming on that soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| I want to go over two announcements of events next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=366)|
| 0:06:12| One, I think will be of interest to a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| is there's a public meeting on case management in public supportive housing next Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=375)|
| 0:06:22| April 28th from 6 to 7 p.m. at the Kansler YMCA on Jessamine Street in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=382)|
| 0:06:30| I think most importantly, my understanding, Mr. Mayor, is on Friday, April 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| you're having lunch with some of your best friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| As I understand it, this is the annual budget announcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| which will be lunch on April 30th at Island Home Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| The public is invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| It's a chance to gather with Mayor Haslam and about 1,000 of his closest friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| to hear his plans for the future of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| I know council should be there and lots of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| I want to encourage folks to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| Well said. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| Yes, I wanted to thank the members of this council and the members of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| for their expressions of condolences during the passing of my brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| And I also wanted to acknowledge the passing of two giants of the civil rights movement this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=436)|
| 0:07:23| Benjamin Hooks and Dorothy Height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| I just wanted to mention them and keep those families in your prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=451)|

| 0:07:35| and everyone else's support and prayers on your brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| Thank you. First a question for Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| The announcement about the workshop, you said it was a workshop on the East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| Yes, it actually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| It's the workshop that started being about the East County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| and morphed into sort of a discussion about development tools we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| I just wanted to make sure that was clear to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| So council's intent, I think, is to have that after we vote on the East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| It's more on development issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| How we go about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Another one to make is the Metropolitan Drug Commission's Youth Action Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| had their annual youth summit on the 10th of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| They met at Central High School in the afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| and embarked on a number of service projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| There were over 135 kids there attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| 35 new toys were made for animals at the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| A wheelchair ramp was preserved with wood stain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| 300 posters were sent out to raise awareness about the dangers of underage drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| Flowers were planted in a nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| Kids went to Rainbow Acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| And 220 families showed up for a food distribution in conjunction with Second Harvest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| So we thank our community partners that worked with the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| That evening, the youth came back to Central High School for the annual Sphere Awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| And it was a great event, and we thank the Metropolitan Drug Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| and the city of Knoxville and Knox County for their support of that important initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| for our youth and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| I just wanted to footnote your comment, Mr. Mayor, about the Cumberland Avenue corridor project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| That information is on the city's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| I think it was the day after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| So it's on there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| And anyone who's interested in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| and looking at the options for pedestrian-friendly sidewalks and bicycle lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| and the options that are being examined should go to the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| And they are looking for your comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| because now is the time to have some positive input into the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| So don't wait until it's a done deal and then complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| Get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| And if you have ideas, look at the alternatives they're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| and provide them suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=585)|

| 0:09:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| 8A is a resolution reappointing Barbara Ray and Lewis Sam Pipkin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| to the Knox County Tax Equalization Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=599)|

| 0:10:13| and they were wonderful members of the board, very fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| And that was probably the best public service experience I've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| Prior to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=620)|

| 0:10:56| Mr. Mayor, I just wanted to let you folks know that Scenic Knoxville does support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| and approve this, and I want to go on record with saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=661)|

| 0:11:08| For those who may not have the advantage of this packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| the two focal points are to have the ability of having lower signs over sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=672)|
| 0:11:19| in those special districts to seven feet if they're not electrified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| and if they are electrified, there's an eight-foot minimum as a safety precaution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| and that was to kind of engender more access to signs in places that are restricted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| like Center City, but still having safety and clearance in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=697)|

| 0:14:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| Thank you, Caroline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Stephanie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Stephanie Welch, 2137 Hillsborough Heights, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| I'm also an employee of the Knox County Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| and I'm here on behalf of public health to support the bike plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| I think it takes us a step towards creating a culture of active living in Knox County and in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=861)|
| 0:14:28| This is really important to address issues like obesity, air quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| Obviously, Dr. Cooley talked about the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| All of these things are related to the kind of culture we create around active living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| So the health department supports the plan, and I know you all do too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| So this is formality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Mr. DelBuffi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| One of those two speakers, I just wanted to ask you, or at least advise you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| that you need to take a look at the Cumberland Corridor Plan because one of the alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| and you probably have, one of the alternatives is to put that road on a diet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| make wider sidewalks, and make, in the three lanes they would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| make a dual lane with bicycles and vehicles, but a safe zone to the side for bicycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=910)|
| 0:15:18| So take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| Make sure the specs make sense to you and provide your comments if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| An ordinance to adopt the Knoxville One-Year Plan dated 2010 is prepared by the Metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| Planning Commission for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| Mr. DelBuffi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Oh, I had my light on before, but I did want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| I didn't mean to encourage you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| But at the last meeting, I did ask that we have a change to the Murphy Road section where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| it went from, and Washington Pike, where it went from general commercial to neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| And I wanted, that was the annexation amendment 2F09RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| I just wanted to remind folks that I'm asking that they adopt this with that change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| we approved last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| And that is in there, correct, Mr. Carlson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| I mean, that change is in the document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| And written on my document as a result of the last amendment, that last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=983)|
| 0:16:31| So is it in or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| It will be upon vote here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| I was just reminding them that they vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| I'm asking them to vote with that inclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| So noted, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| Okay, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| I would like to add, I think it's appropriate to ask Mr. Donaldson to explain to us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1005)|
| 0:16:52| once we adopt the One-Year Plan, what is the next step as far as getting the zonings to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| coordinate with the One-Year Plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| One of the purposes of the One-Year Plan exercise is to prepare for council a list of general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1022)|
| 0:17:10| rezonings that we feel should take place in order to make the zoning consistent with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1030)|
| 0:17:19| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| This is included as Chapter 5 of the plan starting at page 147.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1040)|
| 0:17:27| It's a fairly long list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| And these are actions that can be initiated by city council or the administration to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1051)|
| 0:17:39| the zoning into compliance with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| Mr. Donaldson, the sector plan amendments that are included in this One-Year Plan are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| each passed individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| Acceptance of the plan does not enact all those sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| I need to be clear on the terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| The sector plan is a function or a part of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| The One-Year Plan is a creature of the city charter and is separate but kind of equal to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| We have many instances where the sector plan and One-Year Plan amendments are made for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1099)|
| 0:18:26| individual parcels upon application for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| They can go concurrent with rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| Once each year, we initiate this general update to the One-Year Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| That's what you're dealing with tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| This is initiated by the Planning Commission as a result of the city charter directive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1121)|
| 0:18:49| that we do this on an annual basis at this time of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| So at this time, we bring up to date all of the annexations that have happened throughout the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1133)|
| 0:19:00| all of the individual parcel amendments that have been made throughout the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1140)|
| 0:19:06| and then this year, staff initiated an effort to change the One-Year Plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| for all of the public parks in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| So there's generally those three components to the annual update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| So but my question remains in terms of the sector plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| and the zoning for particular parcels that are included in this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| adoption of the document does not adopt those designations or it does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1171)|
| 0:19:38| The adoption of this annual One-Year Plan update amends the One-Year Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1178)|
| 0:19:45| It has no impact at all on the sector plans or the zoning on any parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1185)|
| 0:19:52| until either the property owner makes that application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| or the council directs a general rezoning effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| Okay. I'm still, I'm still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| So the adoption of the One-Year Plan update does change the sector plan designations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| of parcels mentioned in this book?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| No, it changes the One-Year Plan designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| which are not always the same as the sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| So I'm back to what I originally stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| The sector plan designation and the zoning does not change as the result of the adoption of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| It is merely a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| Again, it's another, it's a separate document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| We have two plans in play, the One-Year Plan and the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| Tonight we're dealing only with the sector, or the One-Year Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| The sector plans are updated on a periodic basis through initiative of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1243)|
| 0:20:50| We do a couple each year or upon the application of an individual parcel owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1250)|
| 0:20:58| There are instances, and a lot of them, where the One-Year Plan and the sector plan are not consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| This will not change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| It only changes the One-Year Plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| I think that had a fog index of about 150 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| As I read the introduction on page 1, it says that the plan is specifically designed to be the basis for land use regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1279)|
| 0:21:28| and short-term public improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| And do I understand that typically we'd like to see the sector plan look at the usage as something that's desirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1291)|
| 0:21:41| and wanted before we change zoning to conform with that or to change some activity on a particular parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1301)|
| 0:21:49| In other words, it's a guideline for how we're going to use land looking one year into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| That's true for both the One-Year Plan and the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| But the sector looks five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| The sector plan has a 15-year land use horizon, a five-year capital improvement program horizon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1321)|
| 0:22:10| and some very broad principles and policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| In the charter, the five and the 15-year components of the directive of the comprehensive development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1334)|
| 0:22:22| are taken care of by the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| But we do have this one-year component, which is the basis for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| Since it was put in place in 82 for a period of time, the One-Year Plan kind of morphed into the zoning map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1350)|
| 0:22:38| and has become a little bit redundant that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| We've been trying to edge it back towards the sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| which have been created since 1982 when this One-Year Plan was put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| For the six-year-olds that are on council, which includes me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| we look at the One-Year Plan as a forecast and as a way of kind of directing or controlling development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1375)|
| 0:23:05| and at least having a guideline for what development is permissible or desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| Is that one of its purposes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| That is one of the purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| I like to think of the One-Year Plan as being kind of an action plan for your activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| in regard to general rezonings over the next year in order to bring all of the two plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| and the zoning into consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| And then if I could ask one more question, Mr. Mayor, on the specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| You have one of the major changes in this document is that you have turned all parks to P.P. designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| which is Public Parks and Refugees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| Refuges, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| Not refugees, but refuges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| That in and of itself does not affect the zoning as you stated earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| but that is a forecast for how that land is intended to be used for the next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| at least looking forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| And any rezoning of the land should be consistent with that designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| And the zoning classification, is that the open space zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| Is that different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Use a different designation than the P.P. that's on these maps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| P.P. is Public Parks and Refuges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| That's a land use classification used in plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| O.S.1 is open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| That's a zone district title used in the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| The fifth grade thanks you, and I hope we got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1469)|

| 0:25:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| If I could ask Ms. Rojero, we had a workshop with you fairly recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| and you had to get your deadline last-minute information in to comply with federal guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| Can you give us a minute's worth of the difference between the draft that we examined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1556)|
| 0:26:02| and this document with the changes you've submitted today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| In other words, is there any highlight to this changing that we should be drawing attention to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1566)|
| 0:26:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Actually, the numbers that we gave you last night in terms of how the dollars will be at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| those remain the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| You have a page, you have a packet that shows the new inserts to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1582)|
| 0:26:29| Do you see what those are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| Do you have that packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| Right, but having it in my hand in the last five minutes and reading it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| Right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| The main part are the citizen comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| That's the main change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| You summarized the comment activity that took place at the workshop and people who wrote or called in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| Plus the actual comments are in the longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| We summarized them in the body of the plan and then in an appendix are the actual comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| But you left the budget amounts the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| I would like to just ask a question to go on record to if you would explain about any allocation of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| I noticed in reading the report, would you explain that in terms of our approval process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| Any sub-recipient agreement, that means that where we allocate our grant dollars to another organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1640)|
| 0:27:32| if it's over, if the amount of that grant is $25,000 or over, then that contract has to come back to council for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1652)|
| 0:27:43| So of all of the sub-recipient contracts that are in that budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| there are a couple of them that are emergency shelter grants that are less than the $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| So you all do not vote on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| But in the other grants that are made to organizations, you do vote on those if they're $25,000 or over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1676)|
| 0:28:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| Okay, ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Bell & Associates Construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| LP, for the Hill Avenue Viaduct Rehabilitation Project in an amount not to exceed $948,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1696)|
| 0:28:24| Move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| Mr. Del Robby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| Sorry to be the one to ask the question, but this contract is for roughly a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| I mean $950,000 in round numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| This is the viaduct between, Mr. King, I guess, our own city building here and basically the old Marriott or the fort, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1718)|
| 0:28:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| And it is going to be out of service, I think you said what, roughly a month while some of the exposure of the damaged portions are being done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1732)|
| 0:29:01| The structure will be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| All lanes will be closed for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| There will be construction going on for about six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| And during that month closure, will you have some announcement of alternate routing or how are you going to handle that part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| We typically would have a press release notifying the public and emergency operators of a detour route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1755)|
| 0:29:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1769)|

| 0:30:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Mr. Grieb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| And I have to ask Mr. Swanson this in terms of suspending the rules for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| I'd like to switch E and F, the next two items coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| You'd like to switch E and F, move F ahead of E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| It would be a motion to suspend the rules and reverse the order in which those two items would be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| The motion is to consider 11F before 11E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1834)|

| 0:30:43| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| What I would like to do, and when I sent this in, that was the order in which I meant for it to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| is that first to have a general discussion about all the parks in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| and then after the discussion on that one, then go to specifically Lakeshore Park on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| So I'd like to go from the general to the specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| Resolution F is the general, and E is the specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| Mr. Del Robby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| If I could ask Councilman Grieb, if we act on 11F, do we need to act on 11E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1880)|
| 0:31:28| How do these work in conjunction with each other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| What happens is, and I guess, Mayor, do we go ahead and have a discussion now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| Or do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| I guess I think it probably does matter in terms of switching the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| So maybe if you could answer that question, then we'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| The concern that I have, and I think part of this has to do with the one-year plan, which we just passed, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| is that a number of our parks in the city, we have well over 80 parks that are over 5 acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1912)|
| 0:31:59| And of those parks, approximately 20 are zoned anything from O2 to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1919)|
| 0:32:06| And the rest are OS1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| So one of the things that I would like to do and like to see is that I'm requesting that the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| go ahead and coordinate all our parks in the city with the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| That's the general asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| The reason that I'm specifically asking about Lakeshore is that one of the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| and again, this is not any kind of a cover-up or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| I'm greatly concerned about any kind of housing that occurs in any of our parks across the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| whether it's supportive housing or any other type of residential activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| I feel very strongly that the parks that we have should be left as open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| They should be left as parks for recreational facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| And I think that with that in mind, if we go ahead and make sure that we have the OS1 designation for all those parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1973)|
| 0:33:03| it doesn't mean that we can't come back and change zoning later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| but at least we have that safety net to where we would be able to be assured that those parks that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1986)|
| 0:33:15| will stay as open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| I'm greatly concerned that I'm not interested, not only as a council person, but as a citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| I'm not interested in saying that any of our park land is either leased or sold for any purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2004)|
| 0:33:31| The reason that I've gone ahead and asked for the Lakeshore Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| that we move that one ahead in discussions that I've had with Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| and he can verify this, is that it will take up to six to eight months to rezone the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| Also keep in mind that staff then goes ahead and looks at all the parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| and they make their recommendation to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| MPC then makes their recommendation to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| So we have an open process here where the citizens can still take a look at each one of these situations in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2038)|
| 0:34:07| I'm concerned about Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| It's a city park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| It's used by thousands of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| It continues to be mentioned as a possibility for permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| and as I said, I feel very strongly that none of our parks should be set aside for any type of residential work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2059)|
| 0:34:26| So that's the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| Now it could be that if the one resolution concerning the overall parks passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2068)|
| 0:34:35| depending on the time frame, that's a good question in terms of whether or not we need to go ahead and do Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| But I am concerned about it, even as of this morning it was still mentioned in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| So that's where I'm coming from on these two resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| Mr. Woodhull, this is only about swapping the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| Yeah, I disagree with swapping the order because I think the real issue is Lakeshore right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2094)|
| 0:35:03| I don't disagree that we need to protect our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| Lakeshore actually was a mental health facility that added a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2107)|
| 0:35:15| And it seemed as though from reading the newspaper and how this is kind of coming before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| that really Lakeshore is the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| And I think that we ought to first speak about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| Yeah, I'm concerned about switching the order as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| And I think part of that is in the one-year plan that Councilman Grieve mentioned that we just adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| a number of recommendations were already made by the MPC who has looked at each of these parks individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2140)|
| 0:35:47| and looked at where they were perhaps inappropriately zoned as residential or whatever, moving into open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2147)|
| 0:35:54| But I think we have parks that serve different purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| And one park that came up for discussion here at this Council was the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| And there was some discussion about moving that to open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| And I believe that was set aside or I know it was not rezoned open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| And there was some discussion about the use of that particular park, although it's called a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| being unique because it's part of the urban core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| And I guess I'm a little bit concerned about Resolution F and its blanket approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2181)|
| 0:36:28| and sweeping in parks like the World's Fair Park that maybe I don't intend to recommend to be rezoned open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2188)|
| 0:36:37| And I guess I prefer the model that the MPC is using up to now, which seems to work successfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2197)|
| 0:36:43| and that is in the one-year plan to look on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| Although Mr. Donaldson mentioned that overall that was an overarching theme of this particular one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| I do have the assurance that each sector designation was looked at individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| Mr. Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Mr. DelBolping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| I was just going to say, is it possible, and maybe Charles can answer this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| that we can talk about those two together and then vote separately whether we go F first or E first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| In other words, can we combine the discussion and get it out on the table and get it talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| and then we can vote on the pieces in whatever order the group decides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| If you vote to suspend the rules, you can do it any way you decide to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| If you do not adopt a motion to suspend the rules, you will need to first consider them in the appropriate alphabetical order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2243)|
| 0:37:33| Counselman Grieve, I wonder if you would consider just talking about them together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| and then have a separate discussion about what order or however we do whatever we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| I don't have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| I would then move that we discuss 11E and F together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| and then we can tackle how we vote on them after we get the story aired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| That's a motion to suspend the rules to discuss 11E and F together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| and that Councilman Del Lope is suggesting that right now we would leave it that you'd vote on them separately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| in the order they're taken, but that you could decide to do that differently at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| Is that what the motion was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| Much better said than I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| Mr. Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| This might confuse the issue because Mr. Grieve said it's actually not about the 10-year plan or permanence of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| It would be kind of interesting to wrap G into that discussion as well, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| which I actually think is the issue, how we do the 10-year plan and how we do an open process on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2306)|
| 0:38:33| So I think saying let's just talk about all three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| Right now the motion on the table is Mr. Del Lope's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| It does not have a second at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| I would accept his amendment if I could, which is talk about all three and get it out and then vote separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2323)|
| 0:38:50| Right now the motion is to add G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| We'll talk about 11E, F, and G at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| I heard a second over here from somebody, but I don't know who, I thought, to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| Which motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| To amend Mr. Del Lope, who would now like to say he'd like to talk about your idea of 11E, F, and G all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| That's the motion on the floor is to talk about all three of them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| But there's nothing in this motion to indicate in which order we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| Right now, until I hear differently, the chair said we'll vote on the original order unless council at some time decides to amend the rules again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2360)|
| 0:39:30| or suspend the rules again and change the voting order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| Right now that's what's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| Yes, sir, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| Who do we have signed up for which of these different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| We have three people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| Two of them signed up to speak on 11E and G and one signed up to speak on 11E and F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2383)|
| 0:39:50| The two for and one against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| How would we handle that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| Just go ahead and let them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| I think we just let them speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| If they could tell us what they're specifically speaking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| Sorry, that's how I would handle it unless you tell me differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| They could tell us what they're speaking towards when they came up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| That's what the motion on the floor is to make sure is to suspend the rules, discuss 11E, F, and G all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| Right now we would still vote on them separately in the original order, but we would discuss them all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| What about the time frame of the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| Well, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| What I would probably do is originally hold them to five minutes, but I would then at the end of that time I'd say if they want to switch the topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2426)|
| 0:40:34| I would ask counsel if they'd like to give them an additional five minutes if that's okay with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2434)|
| 0:40:41| You all stop me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| I don't mean to keep making up the rules as we go, but I'll suggest that and you tell me if you don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| So, Mayor, if a speaker comes to the podium and wants to address 11E, they can do so for five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| and they say now I'm addressing 11F and then they can have five more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| That is what I would do in the absence of further rules from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| It would be sort of by agreement of counsel you can have five more minutes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| I'd probably, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| But my guess is that's how that would work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Everybody understand where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| We will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| I'm also assuming counsel would like to hear from those signed up to speak first unless somebody puts a light on that's where I'm going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| First, as usual, we'll have those in favor first and those against second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| First to sign up is Ron Peabody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2491)|
| 0:41:40| You would come to the podium and start with your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| Ron Peabody, 65 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| I was going to speak on two of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| One, I wanted to speak just very generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| I agree with Councilman Grieve's thoughts about protecting all the city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| I think both of those motions are very good motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| I come from Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| Originally, Atlanta has a very large park that was designed by Mr. Olmstead at the Cotton Stakes Exhibitions in, I believe, 1898 called Piedmont Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2522)|
| 0:42:15| And about 20 years ago, the city of Atlanta made the decision to protect it and develop it as a very large nature preserve and park for the city of Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2535)|
| 0:42:25| There's a lot of big events that go on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| Actually, there's a lot of similarities to Lakeshore other than the previous mental health facilities or the current mental health facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2547)|
| 0:42:36| But there was a golf course there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| They discontinued use of the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| And today, it's truly a central place in Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| And I would strongly recommend that we vote positively or for the E and the F amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2565)|
| 0:42:52| Now, do I understand that I need to go if I'm going to speak on the other amendment as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| You can do that now and your time would start over, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| Give me just a second for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| I've got a feeling these are getting ready to come into use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| Do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| I've got a feeling these are getting ready to come into use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| Here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| It's itching to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2601)|
| 0:43:30| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2610)|
| 0:43:46| Technical difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2626)|
| 0:43:57| Are we having technical difficulties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| Can you believe that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| We could hear another speaker while he's sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| We could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| Mr. McAdams, you're the next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| Do you mind going ahead or do you want to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| I'd rather make Mr. McAdams go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| Mr. McAdams, I couldn't hear your answer back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| What would you like to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| Mr. Peabody, if you could do this in the next minute or so, we will just wait for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| There it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| Well, I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| Can everybody see that even though it's not full screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| Well, you can talk to it when you're on the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| Now it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| That's the scary thing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| You show up and you told the jury it's going to be beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| There ain't nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| We have to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| That's the whole deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| It's long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2701)|
| 0:45:13| No video signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| Okay, here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| Thank you for the council's patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| As you see, I'm going to refer to this talk as a failure to hear the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| I didn't really plan on doing this before we dealt with the other two issues, but that's the hand we're dealt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2734)|
| 0:45:44| The 10-year plan was created in a vacuum with no real community involvement from average citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| As this statement from the 10-year plan clearly illustrates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| basically it has very little representation here of citizen involvement in the creation of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2752)|
| 0:46:01| TYP leadership targeted several neighborhoods to build PSH facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| and encountered very loud neighborhood objections, which they refused to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| Manvilla was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| Flinnegan was approved after a very rare overturn by city council of two NPC rulings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| denying the use on review request by SHF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| DeBuss Lane was chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| And when the area residents spoke, Knox County Commission did hear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| Funding for that project was voted down by county commission by a vote of 15-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| This year, Timbery Lane was targeted by the TYP, and again the area residents loudly said no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| only because of a massive sinkhole, the site was withdrawn by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| Again, the people were not heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| Only a technical site problem removed this site from a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| At the April 6th city council meeting, the voices of the citizens of Knoxville were disregarded again by city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2811)|
| 0:47:00| when council approved the final funding for the Flinnegan school project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2820)|
| 0:47:07| Folks, we tried everything possible to work with the 10-year plan, city council, the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| We asked the 10-year plan to fill out a services cost pro forma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| We also sent this to city council and the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| It was never completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| What we were told in the last city council meeting was that the federal government would pay for everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| except for case management, which would be somehow paid by volunteer ministry center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| And again, basically we were ignored and not heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| We have come to the inescapable conclusion that we are not being represented by our city officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| and that we have to represent ourselves to protect our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| Therefore, as of today, if city council will not address this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| we will proceed with the following referendum drives to place two referendums on the ballot in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| The first, according to city charter section 709, we will be collecting signatures to halt the 10-year plan in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2874)|
| 0:48:02| but allow Menville to continue as a pilot project for two years to obtain information on services and costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2882)|
| 0:48:09| Number two, according also to city charter 709,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| we will be collecting signatures to stop the Flinnegan School permanent supportive housing site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| We are having very serious discussions on whether to recall city council members who have served over two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2898)|
| 0:48:27| for their refusal to work with the people of Knoxville on this very serious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| According to city charter section 708, we may collect signatures to recall the vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| and the at-large city council members for not representing the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| This city council told the people it would do no harm to neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| There is no requirement in the 10-year plan for sobriety, no requirement for addiction therapy in the lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| no requirement to stop patients from using drugs and alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| Placing untreated, addicted people in neighborhoods is grave harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| We must and will defend our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| We are asking you to hear us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| We are asking city council to halt the 10-year plan tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| Use Menville as a pilot project to learn what the needed services and costs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| We also ask you to end the Flinnegan site for PSH plainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| This is not a suitable site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| If you choose not to represent us, we will represent ourselves by ballot referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| Thank you council for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| Mr. McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2973)|
| 0:49:48| Name and address please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| I'm Tom McAdams, 1043 Craigland Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you tonight and would like to cover both 11E and F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| First I'll talk about the request to send a general review of the parks to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=2999)|
| 0:50:08| I would note to begin with in response to Ms. Roddy's comment that the resolution asks MPC to consider rezoning all these parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3008)|
| 0:50:17| It doesn't direct them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| It has them to consider that and I'm sure that they will do what they did when they reviewed World's Fair Park at your request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3019)|
| 0:50:26| and that is they came back with a slightly different recommendation than what you sent down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| What this resolution does is to address once and for all the issue of our city parks going to be properly protected by zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3031)|
| 0:50:40| City council has had a consistent plan for dealing with it but it has not been implemented on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3040)|
| 0:50:47| When you look at the zoning, there are parks in every area of the city that are susceptible to uses other than open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3047)|
| 0:50:56| other than public recreational use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| There are also even in parks that are in the open space zone, those can be used for cell towers, for housing and marinas and other purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3059)|
| 0:51:09| that I think most people in the city of Knoxville would consider inconsistent with public parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| The people love their parks. They love them in every neighborhood, north, south, east and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| I don't think they want them leased to other entities for private use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| I don't think they want parts of them sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| I don't think they want housing built in their parks of any type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| Housing for rich people, housing for poor people, housing for chronically homeless people or any other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3092)|
| 0:51:40| I think they want the parks preserved for public use for all 180,000 citizens of Knoxville and visitors to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3100)|
| 0:51:49| What this, what Resolution 11F does is to say to MPC, please look at all of our parks and let's protect them for public recreational use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3109)|
| 0:52:02| and designate them as open space with special conditions that would prohibit the construction of cell towers, marinas, housing and multifamily dwellings in the middle of our city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3122)|
| 0:52:14| Now what does that do and what is the effect of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| And the answer is, if MPC considers this, it will go through a very public process in doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3137)|
| 0:52:25| And this is the process that the public knows and understands and is used to seeing if you're considering a change in the use of property, including public property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3145)|
| 0:52:36| And that is the MPC staff will review it and make a professional recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| The MPC will then post the property with notices so that everyone who drives by, everyone who lives nearby, knows that something is proposed, some change is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3161)|
| 0:52:53| They will publish notices in the newspapers so that people who follow this can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| It will be on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| It will be considered at any workshops they hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| And then it will come before the full planning commission for a recommendation to you on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| After that happens, it will be subject again to public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| It will be sent to you for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| And under the charter, will be presented to the public after public notice, after two public hearings at which you would vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3197)|
| 0:53:25| That's what it does is it establishes a procedure that if you want to do something different than this with this property, then you must go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3205)|
| 0:53:37| You must let the public be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| We've heard on many occasions how the city is committed to a public process on permanent subsidized housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3220)|
| 0:53:47| But what we see is a very short public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| The one that was proposed for Lakeshore when it was under consideration was four weeks, beginning to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| They proposed one proposal, not an official city proposal, but a proposal from city employees was to grant a five-year lease or a 50-year lease in the middle of the park after four weeks of notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3237)|
| 0:54:11| And what this process does is wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| If we're going to change any park, if we're going to change the use of any park, let's do it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| So let's put this protection on them so that nobody now or five years from now or ten years from now can slip something into a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3260)|
| 0:54:30| whether it's an exclusive high-rise condo development or housing for the chronically ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3270)|
| 0:54:37| This would require a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| This would protect the parks unless you decided after a public process that the use should be changed and that this was an appropriate thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3279)|
| 0:54:49| That's what this rezoning does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| Does it prohibit the use of any city park for permanent supportive housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| No, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| What it would do is it would require that the city bring it through the process, that established public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3299)|
| 0:55:08| so the public and you could consider whether to change the protection and let that go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3308)|
| 0:55:15| And if you decide to do that, you have absolute authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| You can do it just like you could grant it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| So all that it is really stopping is it's stopping it from happening too quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| It's stopping it from happening by some process other than the one that the public is used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3327)|
| 0:55:34| For that reason, I would urge you to support 11F, which gives that protection to every park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3334)|
| 0:55:41| I could read to you a list of public parks in every area of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| major parks that are not in an open space zone, Iams Nature Center, Caswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| I could go on and on in various areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| In every council management district, in every section of the city, there are parks that are not protected by open space zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3356)|
| 0:56:04| And this resolution would start that process, send them to MPC for that review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3364)|
| 0:56:11| come back to you for your consideration, and if you passed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| then it would establish the process that someone would have to go through before building a grocery store in a city park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3375)|
| 0:56:23| or a gas station in a city park or an apartment building in a city park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| It would govern those uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| It would establish a procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| And that is why I urge you to support that review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3391)|
| 0:56:38| I'll shift gears and talk to you a minute about Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3398)|
| 0:56:44| It is unfortunate that parks have become a pawn in this discussion about permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3404)|
| 0:56:52| And it is unfortunate that this process has led to district against district, neighborhood against neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3412)|
| 0:57:01| put it here, don't put it there, allegations that someone will vote for or against it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| because of what happened in their neighborhoods and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| And it's almost many people think a shell game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| I think the public is horrified at the way this process has gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| I think if you went out and asked neighborhoods in the city, would you like to have this in your neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| the answer would be a universal no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| And I think if you ask them, do you want us to stick this in somebody else's neighborhood, the answer is also no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| That's not a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| I think everyone understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| But I think the concern is the way that the city has gone about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| and that is that Flinnegan happened and no one else in the city really appreciated what was happening in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3459)|
| 0:57:48| Most people hear the word homeless and their eyes glaze over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| And frankly, I didn't pick up on it until I saw it mentioned in connection with Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| And it's not east against west or north and south against west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| It's not rich against poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| It's wait a minute, this is what they want to do in a public park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| And that's what brought it to the attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| Lakeshore Park is no different, no better, no worse than any other park, except in one regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3491)|
| 0:58:17| and that is that it has the worst zoning of any city park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| It is zoned in the O2 Civic and Institutional Zone, which permits a plethora of unpleasant uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3501)|
| 0:58:29| ranging from cell towers, housing, marinas, halfway houses, commercial garages, and on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3509)|
| 0:58:37| Many, many, many uses that are totally inappropriate for a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| If the homeless housing issue did not exist, I don't think you would hesitate to recommend that Lakeshore Park be protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3522)|
| 0:58:51| and placed in an open space zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| And what we're asking you to do is to initiate that process tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| It'll go to NPC, professional review, come back to you for consideration, public input all the way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3537)|
| 0:59:04| If the city administration wants to say no, carve out five acres in the middle of it for permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3544)|
| 0:59:11| they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| Or if they say no, that's not on the radar right now, they say we can come back and request that at a future date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3552)|
| 0:59:19| And all that they have given up is that it requires a public process in order to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3559)|
| 0:59:25| a process mandated by law rather than a process someone might develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3565)|
| 0:59:32| Lakeshore was developed on the site of a mental health hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| That is ten minutes total, so try to move toward a conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| It indeed was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| It was created in 1872.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| Lee Thomas, the superintendent who made it possible to open it up as a city park, is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| And if it weren't for him and Mayor Ash and Governor McWhirter, we wouldn't have a park there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| And the difference, though, between that hospital and what's proposed here is totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| That is a secured mental health hospital with a high level of staff to patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| a very secure facility compared to permanent supportive housing, which is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| People come and go as they would and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| It would create a very, very different atmosphere in that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| And I would urge you to protect that park and all other city parks by voting in favor of these resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3620)|
| 1:00:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| Mr. Ulrich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3628)|
| 1:00:47| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| I've got one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| Are we speaking on G or just E and F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| Any of the three you want to speak on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| Do I get 15 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| Jim Ulrich, 551 English Village Way, apartment 917, zip code 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3661)|
| 1:01:09| Many years ago, I used to drive by almost daily the park there on North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3669)|
| 1:01:28| And I used to always see a guy sitting on a bench on the other side of the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3688)|
| 1:01:35| And I always wondered what that guy was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3695)|
| 1:01:42| And reflecting on that over the years, it would not surprise me if he sat there looking out through that fence and praying the prayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3702)|
| 1:01:55| thank God that somebody put that fence up to protect me from the people on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3715)|
| 1:02:08| That's sort of the way I look at zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3728)|
| 1:02:15| Zoning and land use is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| But as humans, for many reasons, we use it, I think, in a way that hurts the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3740)|
| 1:02:32| We try to exclude people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| I think we've seen how our community has developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| And we're trying to change and look at something other than zoning to change the way we're developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3760)|
| 1:02:53| Now, and I'm going to look at these terms as I think, you know, a person that isn't a lawyer, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3773)|
| 1:03:04| that spends hours in this room defining what these terms mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3784)|
| 1:03:12| When I think of civics in institutional space, I look at, you know, our community assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3792)|
| 1:03:24| And I think that was a very good zoning for that Lakeshore area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3804)|
| 1:03:35| Based on history, based on what it could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| Civic to me means benefit for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3821)|
| 1:03:51| We're changing the use of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| We have changed the use of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| And we use some process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| Somebody wanted to expand the cemetery over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| You went through a process and that was handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| I don't think we have a bunch of lawyers in here defining and trying to explain zoning laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3851)|
| 1:04:21| Somebody, I mean, there's, you know, it's definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| I really don't consider that much of a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| I consider it a highly developed athletic facility that happens to be in the open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3869)|
| 1:04:40| One of these days somebody is going to come down here and want to build a big structure over one of those facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3880)|
| 1:04:49| so we can play in it or recreate in it when there's snow or rain or this type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3889)|
| 1:05:00| To me, it's a unique park in many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3900)|
| 1:05:06| It's got a history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| It's urban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| It's probably one of the most unique parks other than the World's Fair Park that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3911)|
| 1:05:18| And I think there's an opportunity here, and I would like not to close the door at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3918)|
| 1:05:28| to use it in maybe something that may not be a traditional park use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3928)|
| 1:05:34| but it certainly would be a traditional civic use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3934)|
| 1:05:41| And until we know what that is, you know, I don't think we should just now decide no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3941)|
| 1:05:49| And I'm not going to go into why I think it's a unique opportunity there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| because when I first heard about, you know, housing going in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3953)|
| 1:06:00| my first reaction was, well, this is just isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| This is the idea that I think is completely wrong of putting a bunch of people with the same problems, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3964)|
| 1:06:13| in one area, the county farm, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| So, you know, I'm just saying, I think we ought to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3979)|
| 1:06:26| I don't think we should use zoning to zone things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3986)|
| 1:06:31| I think there's a lot of definitions of park out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| And I think we got a lot of definitions of parks in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| And I don't think, you know, one thing is going to fit it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=3999)|
| 1:06:44| Are we going to protect it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| Well, I mean, I've been up here several, you new ones don't know me as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| I've been up here many times, and I've had a lot of arguments with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| But one thing I have confidence in, you're trying to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4016)|
| 1:07:04| And I've got more confidence in what you're going to do than if there's a row of lawyers back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| Nothing against lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| So I'm asking you to do nothing until we find out a little bit more what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4035)|
| 1:07:24| Now let me speak a little bit about this, the people aren't heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4044)|
| 1:07:33| I hear this all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| I've even used it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| I haven't been to an MPC meeting yet, and I've been going to them for 20, 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4058)|
| 1:07:45| that people have not worked out and said those SOBs didn't hear us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4065)|
| 1:07:54| I've heard that here many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| That's what makes your job tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| Now if we go to G, okay, to me G is a motherhood resolution, and nobody likes to vote against motherhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4084)|
| 1:08:23| If we really want to solve the problem, what we need is political will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4103)|
| 1:08:33| Not to beat up on a city employee that we say isn't doing his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4113)|
| 1:08:43| If we really want to solve the problem, I would suggest you go back and read an article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4123)|
| 1:08:51| and I think it was in Metropulse, that former city council person Carly Malone wrote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4131)|
| 1:09:00| We had many arguments about public participation, most of which we didn't know what we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4140)|
| 1:09:13| In that article was information from an organization called the International Association of Public Participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4153)|
| 1:09:27| IAP2A, I think if you Google it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| About another minute, Mr. Ross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| They have a program now on public participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| Nobody listened to Councilman Malone back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| We lack the skills, we all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| We don't even know what public participation is other than you do what I want to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4190)|
| 1:09:59| So I would suggest instead of that resolution, we gather political will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4199)|
| 1:10:06| and we also get some training for everybody, including the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| I'd like to make one comment about this, also about people not being heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4210)|
| 1:10:16| I lived for 10 years, just moved a year ago from the Forth and Gill area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4216)|
| 1:10:25| I'm not going to speak for those people, but I've known those people for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4225)|
| 1:10:34| And many of them longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| And what you are not hearing is what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| And what the public is not hearing is what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| And what they're saying is the burden of the homeless are on their backs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4249)|
| 1:11:00| That's not fair to them, and that's not acting like a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4260)|
| 1:11:09| So what I'm asking is let's start acting like a community and get the political will to do the right things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4269)|
| 1:11:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| Mr. McAdams or Mr. Peabody, by rules, one of you has two minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| and Mr. McAdams looks like he's going to win the race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| I would just briefly like to remind council of the history of Lakeshore Park and how it came into existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4289)|
| 1:11:36| Twenty years ago in 1990, a unique partnership consisting of the city of Knoxville, the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4296)|
| 1:11:42| and the private sector in Knoxville set about developing this park through the generosity of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| and Lakeshore Mental Health Institute in making available their surplus land for the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| In terms of whether there is a plan and we know what's going on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| 20 years ago the state building commission started a process that set forth exactly what would happen to that land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4317)|
| 1:12:04| and how that city park would grow and grow and grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| Under the new theories of mental health, they would move into a more consolidated facility as soon as funding was available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4328)|
| 1:12:15| that could be built on 25 acres or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| And the park land, the entire mental health institute of about 150 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| was going to be divided into 100 acres of park land, 25 or so acres for a future mental health site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4343)|
| 1:12:30| and 25 acres for expansion of the veteran's cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| We all knew that it would be many, many years until we grew into the full size of the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| because the state was still using areas of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| UT was using part of it as a private golf practice facility and they'll be vacating it later this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| which will add 15 acres to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| In January, you approved the new agreement with the state for the land swap on John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| which will immediately add 17 acres to the park and in the long run will add 25 acres to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4378)|
| 1:13:05| And all of that was subject to a master plan approved by city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| approved by the state building commission, and made part of the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| that laid out how the park would be developed over time, how it would grow over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| and what uses would be made of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| And that plan, which is publicly available and part of the city's records and the state's records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| calls for recreation facilities, open areas, open space, garden areas, and other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4406)|
| 1:13:35| I'm pleased to report that with the relocation of the golf facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| the park will be expanding into that area and hopefully will be able to construct additional parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4419)|
| 1:13:45| new picnic areas, new restrooms, and so on, more consistent with a general public park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| All of that pursuant to an implementation agreement that has been around for many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4430)|
| 1:13:56| and a plan that has been around for many years to grow this into a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| What started it was the need for more recreation space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| and the fact that there was an impetus coming out of Knoxville to build housing down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4444)|
| 1:14:10| specifically luxury condos on top of the hills down there that would have mountain views and lake views,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4450)|
| 1:14:17| and the decision was made then, we're going to preserve this for the people, all the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| and have it be open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| That's what we're asking you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| That's why we'd like you to support both of these resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| Okay, we are now, we've heard from all of our speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| Now we're back to any discussion from council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| Remember, we're discussing right now any of the three that you would like to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| Mr. Dellibelpi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| Yeah, it seems like we have at least two issues on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| I'm sure someone could make it five issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| but the things that I heard and the things that I've been contemplating as I read e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| and get phone calls and letters, people are really vocal about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| It is, one, what happens to our parks, and that's the subject, I guess, of Councilman Grieve's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4502)|
| 1:15:09| I'm a little confused on that one, and that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| if the city owns all this parkland except perhaps Lake Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| I'm not sure what zoning does to affect our usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| We are the owner, but I respect and understand the notion of public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| but I think of zoning as a private party coming in to change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| and maybe we should get some guidance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| The second issue is, what's happening with the 10-year plan, and where do we go from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4533)|
| 1:15:39| And obviously people are talking about a great deal of dissatisfaction with where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4539)|
| 1:15:45| how we make decisions under it, and are we going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| we've talked probably too much at length the last meeting about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| are we going to do this 15 more times, 12 more times, 10 more times, struggle site by site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4553)|
| 1:15:59| As to the second issue, I really do think that this council or the administration or both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4559)|
| 1:16:05| ought to consider something like setting aside two days for public meetings or hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| or call them what you want, invite people to come in to speak to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| maybe even have different times a day for different subject matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| but just open it up and get more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| Maybe we won't learn anything new, but I think the sense of not being included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| and not being involved in something that affects your life and your community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| is too serious to just ignore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| So with that said, if we're back to the parks part of this, the 11E and F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| I guess I have no problem with the notion that parks should be open space and protected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4599)|
| 1:16:46| but that only seems to be like a surrogate for the second question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| that it's the reason that triggered it, and that is, why are we here tonight talking about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4611)|
| 1:16:57| And it's partly a concern of where we can build these facilities and where we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| and what's a good idea and what's a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| And I'm certainly mindful of what one of the speakers said about Forth and Gill carrying the burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| I think Forth and Gill and Old North Knox have lived with the Mission District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4629)|
| 1:17:14| as their personal kind of influence, and it's been hard on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4634)|
| 1:17:19| And I suppose scattered housing was an attempt, at least in part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| to maybe distribute that burden around the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| But the community is asking a deeper question, and that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| what is the right thing to do, how is the right way to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4652)|
| 1:17:36| and how are they best served, because it's their home and their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4656)|
| 1:17:42| And I've got to give you an aside, and I'll hush up and let others talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| and that is, I would get emails and notes saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| well, my son or grandson uses that park to play baseball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| or my wife walks there or jogs there, and I'm concerned about their safety, and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| Well, the same is true in every neighborhood, and if you're putting a housing facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| with 50 people that have issues that may or may not be under control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| that may or may not be treated with therapeutic care on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| but only with caseworker guidance, aren't they entitled to be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| about what happens to my neighborhood and my use of my block and my street and my safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4697)|
| 1:18:24| And I'm not saying that there's a safety issue tied to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| but I think people want to be heard, and I think we ought to set aside a couple of days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| and hear people before we announce the next anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| And I'd be willing to participate in a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| Mr. Swanson tells me, I forget whether it was Section 624 or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| but there was an ordinance that entitles this council to hold public hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| and we can do that if we need to, but I think we need to address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| As to the parks question, I throw out the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| I don't know if zoning affects the city or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4732)|
| 1:18:55| I guess I'd want to hear whether we respond to zoning issues or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| I mean, basically, if we own the land, we have to decide what a public use is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4740)|
| 1:19:05| and so we ought to debate that or hear from either Mr. Donaldson or council or someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| on what that means to zone a piece of city-owned land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| Does it have any significance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| And I'll hush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| Yeah, you know, Mr. Dell, in a lot of ways I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| I think especially in sort of how zoning affects property we own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| we choose what to do with our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| You know, it's interesting, we have a listing of all these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| that are zoned to allow multifamily housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| Well, there's no multifamily housing because we choose not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| So, I mean, I think you're barking up the exact right tree on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| And I think you're also barking up the tree that the issue here is actually 11G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| and I'm glad we included that in the discussion because it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| How are we doing the 10-year plan in a way that is transparent and open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| And, you know, there is a council rule, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| that says you can't call out individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| So I guess there was a proposal made at the last council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| that we should do a brainstorming session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| And, frankly, that was a really hard session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| And the mayor actually called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| It was half an hour after the council meeting two weeks ago ended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| and what did you think of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| I said, oh, man, we shouldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| It's really hard to have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| We just talked for two hours about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| But, you know, the mayor thought it was worth pursuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| The next morning it seemed like a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| We have – I'm working as your vice mayor trying to figure out how that discussion works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| I mean, Councilman Della Voppe has talked about the idea of public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| There's this question of how we encourage the 10-year plan to be open and inclusive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| and how we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| Mr. Della Voppe, I don't think this council would take two or three days to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| I tend to think that we're going to have three or four hours to do it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| because of the time limits we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| And I'm actually really disappointed that that idea was tossed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| and then the person who tossed it out went ahead and tried to short-circuit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| with the other resolutions because it actually was an idea that we should think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| We should think about how we talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| And we've got to do a better job at it because the 10-year plan is not working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4873)|
| 1:21:19| But figuring out how to do those discussions, getting them planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| getting them set up in a way that is productive doesn't happen instantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| I'm inclined to think 11G is the crux of it, but it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| As Mr. Olgers said, it's kind of an apple pie resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| We think that the 10-year plan ought to be more open and transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| Well, the real challenge is how do they do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| Because they're actually, despite what some people think, they're not trying to be secretive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| It's sort of the nature of the beast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| When you're developing property, there's some level of you can't announce to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| I'm negotiating with this guy to buy his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| It just doesn't work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| We've got to wrestle with some of those really hard challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| I think there are ways to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| Since the suggestion was made two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| I've come around to actually have some ideas on how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| And I think that this question about zoning is sort of sidetracking us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4927)|
| 1:22:16| It's the wrong thing to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| We need to talk about the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| I don't think it does anything because we own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| And it does pit east and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| It pits west against north, south, and east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| where we are in our community stepping up and taking our fair share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| And this feels, the timing of it feels so not in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4954)|
| 1:22:40| And it actually bugs me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| But I got on my high horse a little, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| Continuing on the vein that Vice Mayor Becker is speaking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4967)|
| 1:22:52| when we were agreeing to talk about all three of these together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4972)|
| 1:22:57| my brain was thinking, how are we going to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| They seem to be so different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| And yet I think they are, we quickly agreed to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| because there is a common thread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| And I think the common thread is the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| And I think that we do need to step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| I don't think that we need to talk about the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| by way of discussions around zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| But I have no, I completely understand why people are doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| because it speaks to the eighth tenant of the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| and that is this plan calls for a coordinated effort to inform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| and communicate with the broader community about homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| And so in a vacuum, I suppose, at least that's how they're experiencing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5023)|
| 1:23:50| they're going to pursue protection in a way that makes sense to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5030)|
| 1:23:56| I don't think that we ought to act on the first two resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| but I think that we ought to pay serious attention to the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5040)|
| 1:24:07| and actually step back and ask ourselves what is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5047)|
| 1:24:13| try to gain a clear picture of the homeless community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| homeless situation in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| Because we also need to consider, do we really want to live without any plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| And what exactly, how would we need to prepare ourselves for that kind of reality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| We do need some kind of an effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| And this particular document, this 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| has a great deal of thoughtfulness behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| and that we certainly don't want to throw away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| I think the real issue, as it relates to all three, is in fact the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5083)|
| 1:24:52| We have not created, as the eighth tenant says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| recognize homelessness as a community challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| We're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5098)|
| 1:24:59| We need to step back, and we need to do a little bit of work to get back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| and recover that ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| I think that's the core issue of all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| Mayor, I'm just asking a procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| I don't know if anyone else has their lights on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| but I would prefer to address these issues one by one, so whenever that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5116)|
| 1:25:22| On the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| So right now that's where we stand unless until somebody changes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5128)|
| 1:25:29| Yeah, I would just like to comment on Councilman Woodhull's remarks there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5129)|
| 1:25:35| about stepping back or waiting a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| I think the time to have done it was last time, two weeks ago, not tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5139)|
| 1:25:44| because if we were really serious about stepping back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5144)|
| 1:25:50| and making a huge step forward for the community at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| we would have said, I know there was funding on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| and there will be funding on the table later, because this is a ten-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| and this is something that we're going to be dealing with with a lot more facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| So I think the best thing to have occurred that we'd have stepped back last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5167)|
| 1:26:13| and said we're going to stop, and we're going to listen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| and we're going to lay down until something is found that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| But we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| We forged ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| And it was a step backwards, if not two step backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5183)|
| 1:26:29| Is that a new light or an old light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5192)|
| 1:26:33| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| I think what Nick has to say is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| What I want to say is that I think that the Resolution 11G really speaks to the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5200)|
| 1:26:47| that we do need to continue with an open process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| We need to really listen to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| It's amazing to me in the last two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| and Vice Mayor Becker, you asked me about possibly why this was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| I think in the last couple of weeks the amount of e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| and comments that I've been asked about the whole process has been one that really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| whether this is called apple pie or not, has really opened up the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| To me, what's happened tonight, which again is I look at the positive side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| is that we are having a discussion not only about the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5242)|
| 1:27:26| but also about the zoning issues of these parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| I said in the very beginning that I wasn't trying to hide the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| that I don't want to see supportive housing in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| I also feel very strongly that with the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5256)|
| 1:27:41| I know some of you are saying, well, what are we doing here in terms of our zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| and in terms of the 10-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| We've got the one-year plan, which has to do with our properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| We know that we have a number of parks that aren't zoned properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| But what it does is that by making sure that we ask MPC staff to look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5276)|
| 1:28:03| is once again we are opening up a process by which we can have the citizens participate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5283)|
| 1:28:11| Granted, part of that process has to do with whether or not we are going to even consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5291)|
| 1:28:18| having supportive housing in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| But again, it does open up that possibility for that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| I feel very strongly that with what Knoxville has done over the last 10 to 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5305)|
| 1:28:31| with greenways and parks, that we need to be responsible to see to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5311)|
| 1:28:37| that we do everything in our power to protect those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| And one of the reasons you have zoning is exactly that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| is to protect properties and to protect surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| I think that when, and again I realize that Lakeshore is in the 2nd District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| but Lakeshore is not a 2nd District park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| It's a citywide park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| If any of you had been there over this past weekend and saw the Talahi sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| and saw the opening of baseball and the opening of lacrosse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5343)|
| 1:29:07| children down there playing soccer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| you'll see that it's not just a neighborhood park for those particular neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| It's a city park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| It's a city park that a lot of people have worked hard over the last 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5355)|
| 1:29:20| to preserve and to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| I think that what we're saying is that with that park or with any other park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5363)|
| 1:29:28| we still have the opportunity to allow other things to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| but we really, as Mr. McAdams said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| we really have a process that's really going to guarantee that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| There's a lot of suspicion out there about not only the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| It's interesting to me, I guess being just new in this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| that I always considered myself fairly trustworthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| but I find it kind of interesting how the general public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| doesn't really trust a lot of us in these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| And of course I find that a little offensive since I think that I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| but I can understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| You know, when we talk about that on the one hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| administration says, well, we really aren't going to do Lakeshore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| but on the other hand, when you find out that they're still talking about Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| as a possibility, and it could be a possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| even under the new rezoning in terms of what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| But I do think that we need to protect the assets that we as a city have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5422)|
| 1:30:29| for all of the city, for all 185,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5429)|
| 1:30:33| It really concerns me that we might spend another $7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5433)|
| 1:30:38| for 45 individuals to be on that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5438)|
| 1:30:42| or any other property that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| whether it's $3 million or $7 million, whatever it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| So again, I'm passionate about the fact that we need to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5448)|
| 1:30:55| and keep our green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| I'm passionate about the idea that, again, that we have public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| What this will do, it will just guarantee that we have that public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5460)|
| 1:31:05| when it comes to doing anything that might be different in our public parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5465)|
| 1:31:12| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| Councilman DelaVolta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| Yes, that brings me back to the first question I raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| and I don't know whether it's Mr. Swanson to help answer it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| or Mr. Donaldson or a combination, a tag-team partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| but I kind of wonder what zoning does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| when it's the city proposing to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| I mean, do we go and get permits like a private entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| and go through the MPC process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| or do we pass a resolution or some activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| Is zoning the kind of protection that Mr. McAdams was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| which is the notice and opportunity to be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| before some activity takes place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| or is it somewhat, I hate to say this, but window dressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| when it's the government talking about using its own property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| And I don't know the answer, and maybe he can enlighten us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5521)|
| 1:32:07| I can provide the legal answer to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| The legal answer to your question is an answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| that really tends to be an unpopular answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| but the truth of it is that under the laws that presently exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| the city is not bound by its own zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| The city may use its property in any fashion it desires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| as long as it's for a proper governmental purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| and it's not bound by zoning requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| So whether it has an OS or a parks or open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| it doesn't really matter in terms of it can be ignored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| and no one can say you're violating the zoning law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| It's not an applicable applicant, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| Mr. Donaldson, would you talk to that in terms of your experience as a planner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| as to how zoning affects the decision-making process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| and the concern that was raised, which is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| is this a mechanism that triggers more public involvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5573)|
| 1:32:59| on a decision on using a piece of land that's 100% owned, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| like most parks are by the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| My experience here is that the administration has participated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| in the zoning process many times going through the use on review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5590)|
| 1:33:16| for particular projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| We deal with the Community Development Department quite regularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| with our infill housing overlay requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| and they have participated in that aspect of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5606)|
| 1:33:32| I think the answer is we always have, but you don't legally have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| That's what I think the answer is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| and so the question is how do we provide the protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| that some of the speakers were asking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| and it almost takes me back in full circle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| and that is don't we have to have a re-engagement of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| in looking at the 10-year plan and where we go from here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| whether that's by hearings, whether that's by public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| or some other mechanism, but the concern is that we get the right tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| to do the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| I'd just like to comment especially on G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| We're in really uncharted waters for this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5657)|
| 1:34:22| It's a very, very difficult problem that we're facing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5662)|
| 1:34:26| but I think as a city we're going to have to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| I listened last week or two weeks ago to Councilman Pavlis' comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5670)|
| 1:34:37| and I respected them, and they were very good comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| and I'm very mindful of people's property and property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5681)|
| 1:34:47| but I think as a city we are just charged to try to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| This 10-year plan, I believe we're in the fifth year of it, if I'm correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5693)|
| 1:34:59| and by this point people should already have a good knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| but you really don't because it's getting closer to the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| where something is actually going to be up and running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| and people are fearful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| A lot of times people are fearful of what's new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| and once it actually becomes, it's not as bad as they may think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| but I think we're going to just have to deal with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| in a positive manner as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| and hopefully we can go ahead and do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| I want to ask a question about, I guess to Mr. Lyons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5732)|
| 1:35:36| when the property at Lakeshore, when we approved the VA cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5736)|
| 1:35:43| how much was set aside for the homeless plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| How much was set aside for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| I believe what the clarification was was up to five acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5751)|
| 1:35:57| could be used for other public purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| and we clarified that those could include permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| was what the clarification was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| Not required, but may, right? May use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| May use and up to, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5766)|
| 1:36:10| I'm going to go to Councilman Bailey. I'm not quite sure, but are you okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5770)|
| 1:36:14| I was going to recognize Mr. McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| Okay, Mr. McAdams, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| I think he was going to speak to the protection issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| Thank you, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| I wanted to respond to Mr. Della Volpe's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| The answer is zoning would provide substantial protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| The city has historically complied with its own zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| whether it is legally required to or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| Second, in most cases, the city is not the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| It is a private developer, and the zoning absolutely would apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| and absolutely would control that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| In the case of Flinnegan School, that's been acquired by an LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| The zoning would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| In the case of Men Villa, again, a private developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| The zoning would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| In the case of Lakeshore Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| it was proposed as a 50-year lease to a private developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5817)|
| 1:37:01| Again, the zoning would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| So unless the city itself is the developer, then the zoning is applicable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5823)|
| 1:37:09| and in every instance that I'm aware of, it has been a private developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5829)|
| 1:37:13| and not the city that has built that housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| I appreciate that clarification. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| Okay, Councilman Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| I'd like to address this to Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| Would you just explain why it's important that, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5846)|
| 1:37:31| that we follow the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| and go ahead and make sure that these parks that are not OS1 would be zoned OS1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5854)|
| 1:37:45| The objective of the one-year plan is to provide the basis for the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5865)|
| 1:37:52| that would apply to every parcel in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| You've just tonight amended the one-year plan on, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5875)|
| 1:38:00| 83 different parcels that are designated as parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5880)|
| 1:38:05| To the public park and refuge land use classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5885)|
| 1:38:10| the next logical step would be to rezone in accordance with that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5890)|
| 1:38:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| I want to do a quick history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| and I'm not going to talk about the long history this Council has had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| of dealing with the ten-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5905)|
| 1:38:26| I actually want to talk about some of what's happened with MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5906)|
| 1:38:29| and I want to go to mostly, I think, the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| I guess it's F resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| There are challenges with MPC right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5916)|
| 1:38:41| As some of you know, we've been at meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| where there's been this same kind of frustration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| that's being expressed about the ten-year plan, expressed about the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| One of the reasons that happens is we tend to ask MPC to do lots of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5931)|
| 1:38:58| From our perspective, I thought this for years sitting in this chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5938)|
| 1:39:02| that was kind of just free stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| We could sit up here and ask MPC to study X, Y, or Z, and it just happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| It turns out it's not free stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| MPC has very limited resources for getting things done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5951)|
| 1:39:17| and we're trying to figure out ways to get a better sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| of what we're asking MPC to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| There are points where we have, interestingly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| a resolution sort of like one of your resolutions, Mr. Roof, came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5968)|
| 1:39:35| and I think we all sat up here and said, oh, that's fine stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| MPC ended up spending several hundred thousand dollars on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| just because it ended up being a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| I've been working with Mr. Donaldson to sort of try and get a gauge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5986)|
| 1:39:50| on how much time everything is going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| We can't really say it's going to take this many hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| What we decided is to phrase it as small, medium, and large things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| I think we actually had some criteria at one point for what fed in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| I wanted to ask Mr. Donaldson to comment on whether 11 E and F| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6004)|
| 1:40:10| are small, medium, or large items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| In effect, how much time it's going to take MPC, and keep in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6012)|
| 1:40:17| that means they're not going to be doing other things that we want done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| which is a frustration to plenty of us siting up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| So, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| Well, G wouldn't actually go to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| E and F, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| Yeah, E and F. Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| With respect to item E, which is the Lakeshore Park property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6030)|
| 1:40:37| that fits into the small category because it's limited in scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| to the very specific properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| As we look at F, F is starting to slide into the medium category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6044)|
| 1:40:51| one from the basis of the number of parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6051)|
| 1:40:55| that we will end up looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| But then we also have to look at the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| that are built into the OS1 zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6060)|
| 1:41:05| which may not be applicable across the board to all parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6065)|
| 1:41:11| So we literally will have to look at each and every parcel on its own merits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| and perhaps craft unique recommendations for each of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| or at least for categories of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| So F is getting to be a little bit of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6084)|
| 1:41:29| It happens to correspond with the time that our development services group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6089)|
| 1:41:34| has some time on their hands due to the light number of applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6094)|
| 1:41:39| So the timing is probably pretty good for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6099)|
| 1:41:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| When these resolutions came forth in our packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| I was quite surprised at F when I read the list of parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| that could be used for other purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| As I have talked with people this week and over the past years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6118)|
| 1:42:03| one of the most marvelous things we have in this city is our park system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6123)|
| 1:42:09| And to not have the parks zoned so that inappropriate uses would not occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6129)|
| 1:42:17| or would be less likely to occur, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| is just something that I can't imagine that we would ignore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| Obviously, there's an expense with anything we do or don't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| There's time involved with what we do and don't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| But I think to be sure that all of our parks are zoned as open space, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6150)|
| 1:42:36| would be an appropriate action at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| perhaps correcting oversight in past councils that in their zeal to create a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6161)|
| 1:42:47| didn't look at all the I's and T's, perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| And I see this as an opportunity to get all the parks aligned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| And then if other issues come up, we can deal with those at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6174)|
| 1:42:59| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| In considering the resolutions that are before us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| I think several of us have commented that resolutions E and F| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6188)|
| 1:43:16| feel a little bit like a reaction or even a smoke screen to what the underlying issue is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6196)|
| 1:43:26| which is our community's engagement with the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| which is what's addressed in Resolution G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6209)|
| 1:43:33| And I don't think any of us around this table can deny that there is a great deal of discontent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6213)|
| 1:43:41| and disagreement in our community over how we are addressing the issue of chronic homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6221)|
| 1:43:49| and underlying that issue, persistent and severe mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6229)|
| 1:43:54| It is not an issue that's going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6234)|
| 1:43:59| And it's not an issue for which I am satisfied with the status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6239)|
| 1:44:06| That's why our community came together and created this 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| was to say the status quo isn't right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| The status quo is not a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| Now, is the 10-year plan the solution that we want to continue to go forward with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6255)|
| 1:44:19| I think that's a question that's been asked tonight by a number of people in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| and a number of people up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| And I think the wisdom of taking some time, as Mr. DellaVolpe said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6266)|
| 1:44:33| to re-engage the public, to re-look at this 10-year plan is a wise one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6273)|
| 1:44:40| And I think it's a step that we absolutely have to take right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6280)|
| 1:44:45| But I think these first two resolutions have a terrible liability for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6285)|
| 1:44:54| And that is the sense of pitting neighborhoods against one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6294)|
| 1:45:00| pitting parts of the city against one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| There's a subtext there that's incredibly divisive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6303)|
| 1:45:08| And I think the damage that it does to us as a community is incredibly harmful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6308)|
| 1:45:15| And I just can't support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| I've got to support a plan that is constructive, that looks at solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6320)|
| 1:45:28| and that engages all parts of our city in moving forward in a productive manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6328)|
| 1:45:36| What I would like to suggest, and I've listened to a lot of debate tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| and I don't want to cut off Mr. Bailey because his light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6339)|
| 1:45:44| I think that Resolution F, to send to the MPC a consideration of all the parks, has some merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6344)|
| 1:45:54| As Mrs. Palmer said, there are parks that have a residential zoning that's probably not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6354)|
| 1:46:04| I think considering all the parks in our community and how they are zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6364)|
| 1:46:08| is something that the MPC has already undertaken with the one-year plan that we looked at tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| But to single out one park out of protectionism, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6373)|
| 1:46:23| feels like it just singles out one neighbor against another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6383)|
| 1:46:30| And I also feel like there's some overlap between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| I think we talked at the beginning, if we adopt F, then is there a need to adopt E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6394)|
| 1:46:40| So because we talked about considering these in order, I would like to make a motion to table 11E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6400)|
| 1:46:47| And I can call on Mr. Swanson and ask him to explain exactly what tabling means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6407)|
| 1:46:53| But I feel like that might be the best way to address this need at this juncture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6413)|
| 1:47:01| and then go forward with consideration of F and G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| And I'd like to call on Mr. Swanson and ask what that means exactly, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| A motion to table essentially for your purposes is a motion to postpone indefinitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6430)|
| 1:47:16| until that item is taken off of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| So if you would adopt a motion to table item 11E, that would essentially postpone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6439)|
| 1:47:28| until such time as someone placed on the agenda a motion to remove it from the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6448)|
| 1:47:35| that would be considered at that meeting whether or not to remove it from the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| If it was removed from the table, then it would be placed either on the next agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| or at whatever agenda the vote was at the time was made to take it off of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6463)|
| 1:47:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6472)|
| 1:47:53| As a parliamentary matter, are we just deferring without a date certain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| It's a little more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| It's deferring without a date certain, but it also requires affirmative action to bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6480)|
| 1:48:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6488)|
| 1:48:09| I'm going to go to Mr. Bailey now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6489)|
| 1:48:10| I'd like to speak to that because in a roundabout way, that's what I was going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6490)|
| 1:48:17| I do support really both of these, but I do support F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6497)|
| 1:48:22| I'm glad to hear Mr. Donaldson say that the MPC has the wherewithal to move forward on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6502)|
| 1:48:28| because as Councilman Roddy said earlier, that all parks are not the same and they're different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6508)|
| 1:48:35| It really would be interesting to take a look at these parks individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6515)|
| 1:48:41| and even to see what some of the, I know Lakeshore has its own board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6521)|
| 1:48:49| and the KYS has a lease with the Lakeshore board, but to look at what are in the long-term plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6529)|
| 1:48:57| and really some of the other parks we have around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6537)|
| 1:49:03| I think this is something, as Councilman Palmer says, has probably been overlooked for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6543)|
| 1:49:10| The timing may not be that good with the 10-year plan and some of the things we've heard about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6550)|
| 1:49:18| but I think it is appropriate to send it to the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6558)|
| 1:49:24| to consider changing the zoning classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| As Mr. McAdams said earlier, and I could never say it as well as he did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6569)|
| 1:49:35| but we really, I don't think that we look at our public lands and parks and recreation areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6575)|
| 1:49:44| that they should ever be sold or given or leased for private use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6584)|
| 1:49:49| And even if we did, there ought to be some sort of use on review, some process that the public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6589)|
| 1:49:56| that the public would see this and could comment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6596)|
| 1:50:01| And I think this would set a terrible precedence if we didn't go ahead and move forward with really 10-11-F| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6601)|
| 1:50:14| and to put some protection and to have some, well, just protection actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6614)|
| 1:50:23| So I'm going to support these and Mayor, whenever we move towards E and F and G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6623)|
| 1:50:30| I have a few other comments on that, but I'm going to be supportive of the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6630)|
| 1:50:35| and I'm going to be supportive of 11-F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| And I don't think that this administration or any of us would ever move forward on anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6638)|
| 1:50:44| as it's been sent to the MPC and before we have a chance to see what MPC says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6644)|
| 1:50:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6651)|
| 1:50:52| I think Councilman Grieve and then Councilman Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| I want to be sure that I understand, I guess, Mr. Swanson, what we're sort of saying, what's on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6657)|
| 1:51:04| Well, I'm not sure that's the right term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6664)|
| 1:51:10| And with all due respect to Councilman Roddy, my colleague, I started this out and this is not a smoke screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6670)|
| 1:51:18| And I said up front the concern that I have is permanent supportive housing in any of the parks in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6678)|
| 1:51:26| And I want to make that clear again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| The concern that I have is that 11-F, if it goes forward, the concern that I had with 11-E| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6689)|
| 1:51:37| is that we've had mixed messages about Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6697)|
| 1:51:43| If 11-F goes and we can be assured that there will be no further talk about Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6703)|
| 1:51:52| until we look at all the parks, then I'm in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6712)|
| 1:51:57| But as I said earlier, and again I have no hidden agenda and I'm not hiding anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6717)|
| 1:52:03| I have a real concern about Lakeshore Park because I'm getting mixed messages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6723)|
| 1:52:09| in terms of what could or could not happen to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| But I think, again, Mr. Swanson, if you would explain to me where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6732)|
| 1:52:16| and what we're talking about, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6736)|
| 1:52:22| Well, my understanding is that Councilperson Roddy has suggested that with regard to 11-E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6742)|
| 1:52:31| she would move to table that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| And if that's what happened, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| And if that happens, if that is tabled, then what is being requested with regard to 11-E| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6758)|
| 1:52:45| will essentially be postponed until another time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6765)|
| 1:52:50| and it would require affirmative action of this Council to bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6770)|
| 1:52:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| However, if I understand the process, 11-E could be voted on for the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6778)|
| 1:53:05| and then 11-F could still be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| So they're not tied together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6789)|
| 1:53:10| Could they be tied together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| I'll take 11-F first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| Could they be tied together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| I think he was asking could you vote to table 11-E and approve 11-F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6798)|
| 1:53:23| which was where Marilyn said she was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6803)|
| 1:53:25| Is that the question you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| You're right, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6807)|
| 1:53:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6808)|
| 1:53:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6809)|
| 1:53:30| It's one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6810)|
| 1:53:32| That's what he's asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6812)|
| 1:53:33| Could you do them together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| Why not just take F first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6816)|
| 1:53:37| Then you'll know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| You'd have to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| We could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6821)|
| 1:53:42| Charles, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| Can we vote on those as one motion together right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6824)|
| 1:53:49| If you suspend the rules to do that, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| I think it's a little more confusing if you do it all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| Would we then have to accomplish where Duane is going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| Could we move to suspend the rules, which we already have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| and vote on 11-F and then come back and vote on 11-E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| Is that what you were driving toward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| I want to be sure that if we table 11-E that we have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6852)|
| 1:54:16| In my view, that would be the better procedure to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| so it's less confusing what he just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| I don't want to beat a dead horse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| but I've got to go back to the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6864)|
| 1:54:29| Now, I just heard that we should stop and slow down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| and we've got to stop and we've got to look and we've got to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| All of a sudden, that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| I made that motion at the last meeting for a six-month delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6877)|
| 1:54:41| I didn't even get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| Tonight it's a good idea, and that frustrates me to no end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6883)|
| 1:54:48| because, again, I had a room full of people from my district that were here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6888)|
| 1:54:54| that were opposing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| We had a great opportunity to stand up as a council and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6896)|
| 1:55:01| we do hear you and we think it's time that we stopped and slowed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6901)|
| 1:55:05| I've already said that, but that frustrates me very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| It also frustrates me that I heard the word smokescreen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6908)|
| 1:55:12| I've known Councilman Grieve for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| and he doesn't play smokescreen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| I think the tabling motion is a smokescreen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| The people have elected us to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| I think that this is a horrible idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| It is probably going to pass, but it doesn't address the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| It hides it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| It puts it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| We've got to bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6935)|
| 1:55:36| You've got five votes to not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| You've got to have those same five votes to bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6938)|
| 1:55:43| That's your smokescreen right there, and I'm just totally against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6943)|
| 1:55:48| We're here to vote, and I think we vote the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6948)|
| 1:55:53| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6953)|
| 1:55:56| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6956)|
| 1:55:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6957)|
| 1:55:58| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| I just want to make sure, Councilman Ryder, your motion is on 11E only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6960)|
| 1:56:07| The motion that's on the floor right now and been seconded is only to table 11E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6967)|
| 1:56:11| The discussion was for purposes, just if somebody wanted to explore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6971)|
| 1:56:15| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6975)|
| 1:56:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6976)|
| 1:56:17| Councilman Pavlis, maybe you're hearing things from other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6977)|
| 1:56:21| but I want to be clear, I am not suggesting that we stop or slow down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6981)|
| 1:56:24| and I think that the way I would phrase it differently is two weeks ago you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6984)|
| 1:56:29| let's not do anything, and actually you made a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6989)|
| 1:56:32| and Mr. Grieve talked about a delay of two or three years of not doing anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6992)|
| 1:56:36| when we figured it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| I don't think we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6998)|
| 1:56:39| I think we do need to keep moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| which is why I was not supportive of the delay two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7001)|
| 1:56:44| I don't think that we have to stop doing things to have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7004)|
| 1:56:49| I think we need to have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7009)|
| 1:56:50| We need to have a discussion about how we're doing them, how we do them better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| and what we want to accomplish with them, but I don't think we stop by doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| Now, on the other hand, let me just say, if we're going to sit back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| we're going to approve 11F as some kind of way to stop things, then you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7021)|
| 1:57:08| You got worked over, and the district got worked over last week, or last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7028)|
| 1:57:15| because it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| We have said last meeting, we said we're moving forward with the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7036)|
| 1:57:21| and I don't want to stop that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| We're moving forward with the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| and I am not going to support something that even says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| oh, no, we're taking any property off the table for the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7048)|
| 1:57:34| So, I mean, this idea of let's get rid of 11E, but let's just do it by voting for 11F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7054)|
| 1:57:40| I don't think that's the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7060)|
| 1:57:41| I think this council two weeks ago said that permanent supportive housing is good enough for South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7061)|
| 1:57:49| and a couple years ago we said it's good enough for North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| and I don't want to sit up here tonight and say, well, I'm sorry, but West Knoxville is too good for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7072)|
| 1:57:57| I am not willing to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7077)|
| 1:58:00| So, if you're hearing some level of that, I want to be clear, I'm not saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7080)|
| 1:58:05| and I'm not going to vote anywhere that comes even close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7085)|
| 1:58:09| I'm not sure who is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7089)|
| 1:58:10| I think I'm going to go to Councilman Della Volpe and then Bailey, and then I'll come back over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7090)|
| 1:58:15| I was hoping to maybe cut through some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7095)|
| 1:58:18| If 11E and F are about parks as opposed to the plan in general and what happens in parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7098)|
| 1:58:27| we can, in the process of acting on 11F, which affects all parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7107)|
| 1:58:33| put in a clause like 3A or call it 6 or call it whatever the section of the resolution is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7113)|
| 1:58:40| that says that no action or development of housing or other development other than park usage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7120)|
| 1:58:46| will take place on any public park pending MPC's review and council's action on it on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7126)|
| 1:58:52| That doesn't answer your question about what happens to Flinagan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7132)|
| 1:58:56| and maybe that's a separate subject we have to take up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| but as far as 11E and 11F are concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7139)|
| 1:59:02| if we're dealing with parks and sending them to be examined for zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7142)|
| 1:59:08| and putting that in place as a method of protecting parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7148)|
| 1:59:13| then we can kill that bird with one stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| Now, it doesn't answer your question, what happens to Flinagan going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7156)|
| 1:59:20| or reviewing the action of last week or any other thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7160)|
| 1:59:23| but in terms of parks, that would solve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7163)|
| 1:59:28| Councilman Batley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7168)|
| 1:59:29| I just want to say that I support Councilman Roddy's motion to table it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7169)|
| 1:59:34| but I want to be clear, I support E and F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| and I think E will cover it because we won't move on anything at Lakeshore while the MPC reviews this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7177)|
| 1:59:44| So however you want to work it, I'm going to support both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7184)|
| 1:59:48| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| I guess I need to apologize for my choice of words earlier this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7191)|
| 1:59:55| I certainly did not mean to inflame anybody on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7195)|
| 2:00:00| I guess I concur with Vice Mayor Becker that I feel we need to continue to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7200)|
| 2:00:08| with our solutions to address homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7208)|
| 2:00:13| I don't think, I have not heard another solution that is workable in our community or in any other community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7213)|
| 2:00:21| And again, as I said earlier, the status quo is not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7221)|
| 2:00:25| We have a problem and we have to continue to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| That being said, obviously our method of public engagement with site selection has not been good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7228)|
| 2:00:36| It has not worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| It's a broken process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7238)|
| 2:00:41| And that's the process that I want to step back or slow down and look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7241)|
| 2:00:49| And I don't mean any offense to Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| And I understand his frustration with what happened at the meeting two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7252)|
| 2:00:56| But Mr. Woodhull in his prayer, I think at the beginning, used the phrase deep listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7256)|
| 2:01:05| Maybe we all need to get better at that in terms of how this process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7265)|
| 2:01:10| And I think we also need to engage the community in a better way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7270)|
| 2:01:15| A lot of folks maybe haven't understood what this effort means until they find that they feel like it affects them directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7275)|
| 2:01:27| And I guess my concern with 11E and my reason for tabling it is that I feel like it pulls out a location in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7287)|
| 2:01:38| that has been discussed as a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7298)|
| 2:01:42| There is no funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7302)|
| 2:01:47| The funding cycle has gone past for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7307)|
| 2:01:51| I think that 11E attempts to single out a problem that we don't really have tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7311)|
| 2:01:58| And I think 11F covers the overarching concern of the appropriateness of zoning in our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7318)|
| 2:02:06| And that is why I respectfully made the motion to table 11E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7326)|
| 2:02:11| Let me maybe throw in a comment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7331)|
| 2:02:17| First of all, I guess to the question, if the council is having MPC consider 11E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7337)|
| 2:02:27| we are not going to go forward in any way with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7347)|
| 2:02:31| If you sent that to MPC and asked them to do it with a plan anywhere for anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7351)|
| 2:02:36| whether it be supportive housing or anything else, there is nothing on the docket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7356)|
| 2:02:40| I am telling you face-to-face, we are not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7360)|
| 2:02:43| That is number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7363)|
| 2:02:44| Number two, I don't think when the word spokesman was used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7364)|
| 2:02:47| that was meant to look like somebody was trying to fake something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| I think everybody was saying the real issue at hand is the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| And there is a lot of questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7373)|
| 2:02:55| And I am somebody who has been involved with it from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| I went out and visited numerous cities and sites and talked with other mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7378)|
| 2:03:02| And I understand that there is a lot of issues around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7382)|
| 2:03:06| And if we could go back and start over, there is a lot of things I would do differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| Quite frankly, there is a whole lot of things I would do differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| But the one thing I wouldn't do is just say we are going to leave it the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7391)|
| 2:03:15| We have an issue right now in neighborhoods right now that is costing us a lot right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7395)|
| 2:03:21| And to not address that I think is just wrong both from a compassion standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7401)|
| 2:03:27| and from an economic standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| I believe in the model we are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| But I also realize that we can't keep staying right where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7411)|
| 2:03:35| I mean, Nick, when you said, and I told you that, when you said last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7415)|
| 2:03:37| are we going to do this 20 times, I thought it was one of the most poignant comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7417)|
| 2:03:40| because the obvious answer was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| I mean, nobody is going to be on council if we have to do this 20 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| And so I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7426)|
| 2:03:47| So we have to have a whole different plan of communicating and implementing and selecting sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7427)|
| 2:03:53| But we can't have it be just, well, gosh, I never really thought about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| until it came somewhere close to my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| And then I realized it was an issue because it is already an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| in a lot of people's neighborhoods with a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| And so to say we're not going to have a plan, that's the only part I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7444)|
| 2:04:08| We hadn't handled a lot of things right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| There's a lot of things I would do differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7450)|
| 2:04:12| But I wouldn't go back to say we're not going to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7452)|
| 2:04:16| Okay, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7456)|
| 2:04:17| Mr. Greaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7457)|
| 2:04:18| You know, again, with the resolutions that I brought forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7458)|
| 2:04:21| and especially with item G that's referred to as apple pie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| I'm not in any way saying that we just stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7465)|
| 2:04:28| I'm saying that we do find solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7468)|
| 2:04:30| But what I am saying is that what has happened thus far has had problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7470)|
| 2:04:35| and that I think that we do need to look at where we are, what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7475)|
| 2:04:41| I've lived with a homeless situation since 1982 down at Emory Place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7481)|
| 2:04:45| and know what goes on, and I do know that we need to find solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7485)|
| 2:04:49| So that's one thing I think we need to look to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| I do think, though, that there are really two issues here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7492)|
| 2:04:56| and one has to do with the fact that we have public parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7496)|
| 2:05:00| We have public parks that are not consistent with one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| and that we have an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7504)|
| 2:05:06| especially with what Mr. Donaldson is saying with the timing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7506)|
| 2:05:09| to take a look at those parks and get those zoned properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7509)|
| 2:05:13| And I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| And as I said earlier, and I'll repeat again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7516)|
| 2:05:19| I just feel very strongly that we do not lease or sell any of our parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7519)|
| 2:05:26| any of the property in our parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7526)|
| 2:05:28| and that those parks are not to be used for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7528)|
| 2:05:32| They're to be used for recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| We have a green city. We have a city that's on the go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| We have a city that is going to continue to improve its greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7536)|
| 2:05:40| improve its parks, and I hope that we preserve what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| and we move forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7544)|
| 2:05:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7546)|
| 2:05:47| Right now the motion that's on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| the motion that's on the floor, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| is to, and it's been seconded, is to table E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7552)|
| 2:05:56| and that's the only motion on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| So, Mr. DelBolpi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7559)|
| 2:06:01| I would ask that we take up F first and suspend the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7561)|
| 2:06:05| and see where that comes out, and then it makes E a lot easier to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7565)|
| 2:06:09| Okay, I guess a motion to suspend the rules takes precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7569)|
| 2:06:13| I want to make sure I got my, we're not sure here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| Okay, I just got permission from Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| I have a lawyer and my vice mayor, so they let me decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7580)|
| 2:06:23| On everything or just this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7583)|
| 2:06:25| Okay, darn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7585)|
| 2:06:26| Okay, there's been a motion to suspend the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| which I'm going to say right now takes precedence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| and you're saying that we would consider F first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7590)|
| 2:06:34| Is that what the motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7594)|
| 2:06:36| That's what the motion is, and I had a tail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7596)|
| 2:06:39| but I don't know whether that's the subject of a separate motion or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7599)|
| 2:06:41| I think we have to get past this procedural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7601)|
| 2:06:44| I think, knowing what I think we're trying to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| I think that probably is a separate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| Mr. Green, would you please, for clarification, read 11F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7608)|
| 2:06:56| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7616)|
| 2:06:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7617)|
| 2:06:58| All the words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7618)|
| 2:06:59| The entire thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| We're not voting on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7620)|
| 2:07:02| Right now, we're not voting on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7622)|
| 2:07:03| Right now, we're just moving to consider 11F first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7623)|
| 2:07:08| Oh, okay, suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7628)|
| 2:07:09| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7629)|
| 2:07:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7630)|
| 2:07:11| And there's not a second, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7633)|
| 2:07:14| Okay, there's a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7634)|
| 2:07:15| Okay, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7635)|
| 2:07:16| This is to consider, to suspend the rules and consider 11F first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7636)|
| 2:07:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7641)|
| 2:07:22| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7644)|
| 2:07:25| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7645)|
| 2:07:26| Okay, I heard all nine ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| Did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7648)|
| 2:07:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7649)|
| 2:07:30| Would you like Ms. Mitchell to read that, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7652)|
| 2:07:33| 11F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7653)|
| 2:07:36| Yeah, just the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| Does everyone else understand it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7660)|
| 2:07:41| Okay, well then, let's vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| That brings me to my amendment, and I suppose Mr. Swanson is probably the best person to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7665)|
| 2:07:51| address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| Is there a place, whether it be 3A or just at the very end that we put some kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7672)|
| 2:07:57| tail or a clause that says that no public or private housing development of any kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7677)|
| 2:08:03| shall take place on park property until MPC and council complete the review set forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7683)|
| 2:08:09| herein?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7689)|
| 2:08:10| In other words, that we do the step we've been talking about for the last hour, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7690)|
| 2:08:16| we review the zoning and act on the zoning, and then a matter can come up specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7696)|
| 2:08:23| with the precautions and protections of someone making a proposal, a notice, the black sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7703)|
| 2:08:29| the hearing, or whatever it takes to get a zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7709)|
| 2:08:34| This refers, 11F refers to all parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7714)|
| 2:08:38| Yes, the proposed amendment that you're making is frankly an entirely different subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7718)|
| 2:08:48| And I would really not, it's up to the presiding officer of council to make this ultimate decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7728)|
| 2:08:57| but in my opinion, your proposed amendment is not sufficiently connected to the subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7737)|
| 2:09:04| matter of this particular resolution to be an appropriate amendment to this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7744)|
| 2:09:10| Nick, I think what you're proposing...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7750)|
| 2:09:11| It's a separate act all by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7751)|
| 2:09:12| Yeah, you're proposing, I think, a moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| I mean, we've told...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7754)|
| 2:09:15| In parks, not in the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7755)|
| 2:09:16| No, no, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7756)|
| 2:09:17| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7757)|
| 2:09:18| But that whole different issue, if you want to do that, I would suggest you do that after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7758)|
| 2:09:24| this has been resolved one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7764)|
| 2:09:26| So that all we're going to do is study zoning and it's just a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7766)|
| 2:09:29| We've already told you nothing's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7769)|
| 2:09:34| Right, but you're afraid to say it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7774)|
| 2:09:37| I'm not afraid to say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| Why can't it say, and we won't do nothing different in the meantime, on parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7779)|
| 2:09:44| That's like saying this is a resolution to study the zoning in parks and to change the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7784)|
| 2:09:50| speed limit to 45 miles an hour across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7790)|
| 2:09:53| It's a completely separate subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7793)|
| 2:09:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| Okay, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7797)|
| 2:10:00| Yeah, I'm a little worried, Mr. Haslam, at your continued insistence that nothing's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7800)|
| 2:10:06| to happen because, frankly, one of the problems we've got, we're in the fifth year of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7806)|
| 2:10:11| 10-year plan and a whole lot of nothing's happening and it bugs me that your answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| to this is that we're going to have more of nothing happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| But I'll put that aside for a little while because I just needed to say that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7819)|
| 2:10:23| it bugs me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| I'm going to vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| And mostly I'm going to vote against it because we don't need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7828)|
| 2:10:33| You know, Mr. Grieve, you talked about, well, if we lease or sell, we need to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7833)|
| 2:10:38| the zoning's in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7838)|
| 2:10:39| We decide to lease or sell and we ain't going to lease or sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| These are our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| We don't need to change the zoning to decide what we do with our land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7844)|
| 2:10:48| They don't trust you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7848)|
| 2:10:49| Well, I mean, and the part that offends me is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7849)|
| 2:10:54| Not you personally, but us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7854)|
| 2:10:56| There actually is a need for MPC to do lots of things right now that are not getting done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7856)|
| 2:11:00| Interestingly, in this list of parks, the Christenbury ball fields are zoned R2 with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7860)|
| 2:11:07| an H1 overlay, which creates this fear, oh my God, somebody could build apartments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7867)|
| 2:11:11| Well, that ain't going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7871)|
| 2:11:12| It's been zoned R2 for probably 40 years and nothing's happened and it's not going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7872)|
| 2:11:17| because we own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7877)|
| 2:11:18| The challenge is most of the neighborhood is zoned R2, H1 as well and that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7878)|
| 2:11:23| And MPC doesn't seem to be finding the resources to figure that problem out and I don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7883)|
| 2:11:28| them fixing a problem that doesn't exist and putting off real problems that do exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7888)|
| 2:11:34| My neighborhood has a problem with incompatible zoning coming in that isn't being dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7894)|
| 2:11:40| Inskip has problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| There are development, there are planning problems all over this city and I don't want us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7902)|
| 2:11:49| put them off for a problem that doesn't exist because these problems don't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7909)|
| 2:11:54| One, we're not bound by the zoning and two, we're not going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7914)|
| 2:11:59| We're not going to make these decisions about building multi-family housing in these in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7919)|
| 2:12:05| some dark room someplace with no public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7925)|
| 2:12:08| We have long, torturous discussions about these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7928)|
| 2:12:13| So I think this is a waste of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| It's not a big chunk of resources, it's a waste of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7936)|
| 2:12:19| And we owe the people, all the people of the city, a better use of their resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7939)|
| 2:12:24| So I'm opposed to 11F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7944)|
| 2:12:27| With all due respect, Vice Mayor, if you feel that strongly about it, I guess I don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7947)|
| 2:12:33| why you would not want to be sure that all the parks are zoned OS1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7953)|
| 2:12:39| We also heard from Mr. Donaldson that now is a good time to do this and to look into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7959)|
| 2:12:44| If you have problems in your district with zoning or situations like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7964)|
| 2:12:49| then you bring them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| And what I'm saying is that we have a problem with zoning parks all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7971)|
| 2:12:57| And we have an opportunity in which to correct that, in which to take these parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7977)|
| 2:13:03| and these places and go ahead and make sure they coordinate with the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7983)|
| 2:13:08| that we just approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7988)|
| 2:13:11| And sure, there's a lot of other kinds of zoning problems and this sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7991)|
| 2:13:16| but what we've put on the table and what we're telling MPC now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7996)|
| 2:13:19| or what we hopefully are going to ask MPC to do, is to go ahead and be consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=7999)|
| 2:13:26| with the parks in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8006)|
| 2:13:29| And you talk about, you say, well, we're not going to do this, we're not going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8009)|
| 2:13:33| This is a sure way to make sure that we, and I'm talking about we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8013)|
| 2:13:37| I'm not talking about just you, I'm talking about we, don't do those kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8017)|
| 2:13:41| without this addition of public process when it comes to zoning, which Mr. McAdams referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8021)|
| 2:13:48| It's just another layer of checking and making sure and giving confidence to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8028)|
| 2:13:54| that we will do the right thing, that we will have them engaged if, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8034)|
| 2:14:01| we decide that maybe different types of things are going to happen in these parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8041)|
| 2:14:06| I just, I really, like I said, in all due respect, I don't see that it's a big problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8046)|
| 2:14:11| to go ahead and have this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8051)|
| 2:14:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| Let's see, Mr. Bailey now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8059)|
| 2:14:20| I'm going to support this and private developers would be bound by our zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8060)|
| 2:14:25| and that's what this does and it will add protection and consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8065)|
| 2:14:31| and I think it's a long time coming and it's unfortunate of the timing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8071)|
| 2:14:35| but I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| Okay, any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8077)|
| 2:14:39| Just for clarity, where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8079)|
| 2:14:42| The motion right now is just to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8082)|
| 2:14:46| We don't have a motion on 11F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| 11F is coming first, the question is to consider 11F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| Oh yeah, we haven't even voted to consider 11F first, I don't think yet, have we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8091)|
| 2:14:55| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8095)|
| 2:14:56| We did? Oh, I'm sorry, excuse me, we did, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8096)|
| 2:14:58| Now we're back to, we need a motion on 11F, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8098)|
| 2:15:01| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8101)|
| 2:15:02| All right, sorry, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8102)|
| 2:15:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| Okay, there's a motion and a second to approve 11F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8106)|
| 2:15:12| Okay, all those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8112)|
| 2:15:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8115)|
| 2:15:16| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8117)|
| 2:15:18| Okay, I heard Becker and Brown as no's, are there any other no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8118)|
| 2:15:22| So I have seven ayes and two no's with Becker and Brown as no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8122)|
| 2:15:26| Somebody correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8126)|
| 2:15:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8128)|
| 2:15:30| Then 11F is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| And now we voted, now we're back to 11E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| There's a motion on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8137)|
| 2:15:38| There's a motion on the floor to table that which was pre-existing and is seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8138)|
| 2:15:43| Mr. DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8143)|
| 2:15:44| If I read the attachment correctly to 11F, which we just acted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8144)|
| 2:15:50| one of the many parks listed in there is Lakeshore Park, 60 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8150)|
| 2:15:55| which I assume is the portion the city currently owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8155)|
| 2:15:58| Is that a fair guess that that's about a 60-acre park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8158)|
| 2:16:01| Maybe Sam knows, or I don't know if Joe is around there, but isn't that what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8161)|
| 2:16:05| It's just one of the many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| The state's zones, yeah, I think that's about what the city owns now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| With that in mind, it seems to me that we're studying the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8171)|
| 2:16:14| and to correct the zoning at Lakeshore as well as the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8174)|
| 2:16:18| and I think at that point 11E is either unnecessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8178)|
| 2:16:23| or starts to raise the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| are we pitting one neighborhood against another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8186)|
| 2:16:29| If we're looking at parks and protecting parks, let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8189)|
| 2:16:32| If we're talking Lakeshore, let's just have a big long meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8192)|
| 2:16:36| on the 10-year plan at Lakeshore and get that over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8196)|
| 2:16:39| But if the issue in front of us is parks and the zoning and the proper use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8199)|
| 2:16:44| and the limits that private developers can have, I think we've addressed it in 11F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8204)|
| 2:16:49| So I would say whether it's tabling or withdrawing for the time being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8209)|
| 2:16:53| would be the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| Okay, the motion, excuse me, Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| I just want to say, Councilman, I think we're having that big long meeting right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| And I think it's barely begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8221)|
| 2:17:04| I think it's a two-day meeting that we're going to have to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8226)|
| 2:17:07| The motion on the floor and the second is to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8227)|
| 2:17:10| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8232)|
| 2:17:13| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8233)|
| 2:17:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8234)|
| 2:17:15| Okay, I heard eight ayes and a no from Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| I got that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8238)|
| 2:17:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8239)|
| 2:17:22| Now we're to 11G, which we have not voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8242)|
| 2:17:26| So that would be, right now there's no motion on the floor regarding 11G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8246)|
| 2:17:30| We have discussed it, but it can be re-discussed or there can be a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8250)|
| 2:17:34| Why doesn't someone read the caption so we know what we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8254)|
| 2:17:37| A resolution respectfully requesting and encouraging the Mayor's Office of the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8257)|
| 2:17:41| to end chronic homelessness to engage in an open, educational, and transparent public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8261)|
| 2:17:45| with regard to locating permanent supportive housing facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8265)|
| 2:17:49| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8269)|
| 2:17:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8270)|
| 2:17:53| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8273)|
| 2:17:54| I want to actually toss in an amendment, and this goes back to Mr. Ohl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8274)|
| 2:17:57| which is calling this apple pie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8277)|
| 2:18:00| I think, and Mr. Swanson, check me on this, of course, a new Section 2 that would say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8280)|
| 2:18:06| Council asks the Administration, and I'll put the Vice Mayor down, to develop a plan for working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8286)|
| 2:18:19| to implement this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8299)|
| 2:18:23| Something that says we're actually going to do something to move this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8303)|
| 2:18:27| And I'm not whetted on the language at all, but it feels like this needs a we do something out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8307)|
| 2:18:36| More than just we ought to do better, we've got to get a plan to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8316)|
| 2:18:39| So that's an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8319)|
| 2:18:43| Okay, there's a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8323)|
| 2:18:46| What would it say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8326)|
| 2:18:49| Say your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8329)|
| 2:18:52| Do you want me to take a run at it and see what it sounds like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8332)|
| 2:18:55| You are much better with language than I am, although I do talk much more than you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| Go figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8338)|
| 2:19:01| Council respectfully requests the Administration to develop a plan for working together with the Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8341)|
| 2:19:08| and any necessary others to implement this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8348)|
| 2:19:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8353)|
| 2:19:16| Others? What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8356)|
| 2:19:19| Whoever it might be. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8359)|
| 2:19:22| Okay, I heard a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8362)|
| 2:19:25| You feel free to draft your own. I'm doing it on the spur of the moment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8365)|
| 2:19:28| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8371)|
| 2:19:34| All the questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8374)|
| 2:19:37| Yeah, I was just making sure. All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8377)|
| 2:19:40| Opposed, no? Okay, motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8380)|
| 2:19:43| That was on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8383)|
| 2:19:46| Oh, excuse me. The motion to amend. Sorry. Now the motion back to us amended. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8386)|
| 2:19:49| I'll get better here. Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8389)|
| 2:19:52| Thank you, Mayor. I don't know if you plan to speak in defense of the process thus far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| of what's taken place on this 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8395)|
| 2:19:58| but for the last five years I've sat up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8398)|
| 2:20:01| and in the beginning I was someone that was very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8401)|
| 2:20:08| a lot of the things you hear today about how we bus in homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8408)|
| 2:20:13| we recruit homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8413)|
| 2:20:16| all these issues that you hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8416)|
| 2:20:19| I was very leery of this 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8419)|
| 2:20:22| But as I sat up here and I listened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8422)|
| 2:20:25| and you take these issues one by one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8425)|
| 2:20:28| it's a very comprehensive issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8428)|
| 2:20:31| and it takes a long learning and educational process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8431)|
| 2:20:34| to, I think, get a grip on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8434)|
| 2:20:37| But when you talk about the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8437)|
| 2:20:40| I think, and I'm speaking without them being here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8440)|
| 2:20:43| on behalf of the other five council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8443)|
| 2:20:46| that we have prided ourselves on the way that we work with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8446)|
| 2:20:49| and the public process and the input and the dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8449)|
| 2:20:52| and all those things that we hear about now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8452)|
| 2:20:55| in my view, have gone on all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8455)|
| 2:20:58| Now, I do think that we can always do things better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8458)|
| 2:21:01| but when it comes to these site selections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8461)|
| 2:21:04| these rezoning issues, rezoning is never a fun thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8464)|
| 2:21:07| And these issues that we've looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8467)|
| 2:21:10| rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8470)|
| 2:21:13| you always have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8473)|
| 2:21:16| And I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8476)|
| 2:21:19| I've listened to people, I've talked to them, I've heard their complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8479)|
| 2:21:22| but that doesn't mean that I agree with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8482)|
| 2:21:25| And I think that's the most important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8485)|
| 2:21:28| And Mr. Ulrich earlier said that some of these things take political will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8488)|
| 2:21:31| And that's exactly what it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8491)|
| 2:21:34| And we, in the last five years, have made votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| and had workshops and gone incrementally, step by step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8497)|
| 2:21:40| along with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8500)|
| 2:21:43| Sometimes they have television, sometimes they cover these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| sometimes they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8506)|
| 2:21:49| But I think that the 10-year plan, like every other thing that we've tried to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8509)|
| 2:21:52| has been in step with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8512)|
| 2:21:55| Now, I'm all for, I'm not for slowing down, I'm for moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8515)|
| 2:21:58| The site selection is going to be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8518)|
| 2:22:01| That's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8521)|
| 2:22:04| And I asked Mr. Lawler earlier, or two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| if he could kind of come up with a criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8527)|
| 2:22:10| a priority list of what goes into a site selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8530)|
| 2:22:14| And then combine that with the economics of the real estate and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8534)|
| 2:22:20| That's what we ought to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8540)|
| 2:22:23| And if somebody disagrees with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8543)|
| 2:22:26| then I'd like to hear what their solution is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8546)|
| 2:22:29| Because I think this is the very best solution that I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8549)|
| 2:22:32| And I'm proud of the way we've operated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8552)|
| 2:22:35| but I'm really tired of people that have just showed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8555)|
| 2:22:39| that are casting a shadow over the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8559)|
| 2:22:44| Because that is entirely false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8564)|
| 2:22:47| And I want to speak, I'll probably support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8567)|
| 2:22:50| because I do believe we can do a better job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| but I am going to defend what the council and the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8573)|
| 2:22:56| and Mr. Lawler and his office over there has done over the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8576)|
| 2:23:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8581)|
| 2:23:04| Yes, well, I'm going to disagree respectfully with Councilman Bailey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8584)|
| 2:23:07| because I sat in that audience a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8587)|
| 2:23:10| and heard people from South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8590)|
| 2:23:13| being told that they could only talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8593)|
| 2:23:16| whether O1 zone or some other zone was appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8596)|
| 2:23:19| when you had the first meeting on Flinnegan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8599)|
| 2:23:22| when the real issue was, what are you doing to my community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8602)|
| 2:23:26| and is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8606)|
| 2:23:29| And someone told them from this panel or from the law office or somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8609)|
| 2:23:32| that they didn't have, they didn't use these words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8612)|
| 2:23:35| they didn't have the constitutional right of free speech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8615)|
| 2:23:38| and of petitioning their government to address these questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8618)|
| 2:23:42| because some idiot in Washington passed a federal housing act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8622)|
| 2:23:47| that has no authority to hush a citizen up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8627)|
| 2:23:50| when they want to speak their mind about what's right or wrong with the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8630)|
| 2:23:54| And we didn't listen, and this panel didn't listen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8634)|
| 2:23:57| or the prior one did not, and that was unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8637)|
| 2:24:00| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8640)|
| 2:24:04| Sorry for the emotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8644)|
| 2:24:08| Well, thank you, Councilman Bailey, I appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| because I do think, this is a hard topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8651)|
| 2:24:14| and I talk to people all over cities everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8654)|
| 2:24:17| if it was easy, we would have figured out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8657)|
| 2:24:20| everybody has the same sort of struggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8660)|
| 2:24:23| And I'll say something else, within the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| housing is a piece of it, the housing first was a prime component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8666)|
| 2:24:29| it was a huge effort to integrate services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8669)|
| 2:24:32| and we have made incredible progress, I can't tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8672)|
| 2:24:35| I wish everybody had some small sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8675)|
| 2:24:38| for how much progress has been made there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8678)|
| 2:24:41| the hard work that's been done about getting agencies to coordinate with others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8681)|
| 2:24:44| and the difference that's made in real people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| And we have made some great headway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| so I hate it that that gets ignored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8690)|
| 2:24:53| I hate it that we have all these battles here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8693)|
| 2:24:56| but we'll continue to try to do everything we can to make it open and transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| and to find ways to help address the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8699)|
| 2:25:02| and not ignore it to address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8702)|
| 2:25:05| and yet not to have every one of these be a huge food fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8705)|
| 2:25:08| So that's what we're trying to work on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| I don't know if it's possible or not, but you have our pledge to try to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8711)|
| 2:25:14| Councilman Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8714)|
| 2:25:17| Mayor, I just want to say that you hit upon something that I wanted to kind of close on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8717)|
| 2:25:20| I think that all of us have been really greatly involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8720)|
| 2:25:24| in this situation in the last week or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8724)|
| 2:25:27| and not only with our constituents, but also with the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8727)|
| 2:25:31| And I do want to stress that this is one small part of the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8731)|
| 2:25:37| and if you go back and if you read the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8737)|
| 2:25:40| and you see what has happened in the last five years in terms of services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8740)|
| 2:25:43| and also in terms of identifying the homeless and this sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8743)|
| 2:25:46| a lot of good things have come out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8746)|
| 2:25:49| And what I do want to say is, even though we've had what I consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8749)|
| 2:25:53| a pretty long and healthy discussion over the situation in terms of the housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8753)|
| 2:25:59| that I do feel that knowing the fellow council members that we have here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8759)|
| 2:26:04| that we can move forward and that we have that opportunity to continue to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8764)|
| 2:26:08| and continue to work with the administration to really find real solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8768)|
| 2:26:13| to what the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8773)|
| 2:26:16| And the thing that I see that we're taking away with us tonight is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8776)|
| 2:26:19| we have made a commitment that it is going to be an open process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8779)|
| 2:26:22| or I should say more open than what it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8782)|
| 2:26:25| And I do know that there's been a lot of hard work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8785)|
| 2:26:28| and I don't think that any of us have any intention of trying to close it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8788)|
| 2:26:32| or shut it off, but I think that we all are seriously concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8792)|
| 2:26:36| and seriously want to be involved in terms of what those solutions might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8796)|
| 2:26:40| and we want to have that opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8800)|
| 2:26:43| So I just wanted to close with those remarks. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| Anybody else? Okay, we have it ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8806)|
| 2:26:50| All those in favor, aye. Aye. Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8810)|
| 2:26:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8813)|
| 2:26:56| 12A is an emergency ordinance appropriating the sum of $1,100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8816)|
| 2:27:00| from the Community Improvement Fund and donating same to South Knoxville Heritage Center, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8820)|

| 2:27:09| Requested by council members Pablis Palmer, Della Volpe, and Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8829)|
| 2:27:13| Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8833)|
| 2:27:16| All those in favor, aye. Aye. Opposed, no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100420?start=8836)|
