| 0:07:23| Yeah, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| I was rocking along with the St. Patty's Day and then I saw the Cutthroat Shamrock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| I mean, there's no knives involved, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| What is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| Cutthroat Shamrock is a pretty traditional pirate Irish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| Hey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=456)|

| 0:07:46| Pirate Irish Celtic is a pretty good description of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| But this is kind of they're all kind of going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=472)|

| 0:08:05| which actually has been pretty good weather, even better than summer for some of our events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=485)|

| 0:08:12| I was thinking about singing Oh Danny Boy and then I saw the Cutthroat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=492)|

| 0:10:58| Next is the Schultz Brow Brewing Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Schultz Brewing Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=660)|

| 0:11:02| I think like off-brow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| German was not my language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| I was Spanish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=664)|

| 0:11:06| Nico Schultz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| Address is 126 Bernard Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| And you have had some previous permits, and obviously you're not ready quite yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| So what's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| I'm in the same boat, having issues with my contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| So I would also like to file an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| 30 or 60?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| 60, just to be on the safe side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| So we'll see you again in April also, if we approve this extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| So approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| Move to approve the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=685)|

| 0:11:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| Well, I hope you get this done so that when you come back in April, you'll be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=688)|

| 0:11:39| Well, I hope you get this done so that when you come back in April, you're ready to celebrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| I do, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| We have additional items on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| We have two TABC-related hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| One is Govino's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| And just to refresh every...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| If you want to come on up from Govino's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| Just to refresh everybody's memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| This started in September, and then they paid a fine, sent a remedial plan, launched the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| And then after all of that had happened, and we had taken our action, once again, we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=712)|
| 0:12:22| the notice from TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| So I would like to make the recommendation for us to discuss that we not send them any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=745)|
| 0:12:33| further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| They've paid a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| They've submitted a remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| And I'm not sure what else a hearing officer could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| Counsel Mandela-Vopay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| I'm trying to understand, and this gentleman can help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| On December 31st, you had an agreed order, I guess, with the TABC, but then they scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| a hearing in early January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| Is that something different, or just to review the draft order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| It was to review, because they wanted us to do the closure within January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| So that was when that was set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| There was a change of ownership, right, Govino?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Last July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| And this incident happened in between business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| Events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| So if no one has another idea, I would just say that we are satisfied with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| Do you need a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| We do not need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Unless Mr. Frost tells us, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| Do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| I'm satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| We don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| Well, good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| I know that Govino's has a lot of customers, because when I go by Kingston Pike, I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| you're busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| Keep serving good food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| And checking IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| Oh, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Next is Cheddar's Casual Cafe, and this is in my district, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Jimmy Holbrook, 1563 Lewisbrook Lane in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| As the board may recall, we were here back in December and laid out a comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=827)|
| 0:13:57| regarding sting operation back then, and we advised the board at that time about the ABC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=837)|
| 0:14:05| agreement and the temporary suspension of license on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| That has, in fact, occurred back in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| That was successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| We used that time to do re-education of our employees, and the board, of course, back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=857)|
| 0:14:24| in December said there was going to be no further, you know, problems or penalties associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| And so we've done that successfully, and we're looking forward to moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| And we're looking forward to not seeing you again before the beer board for another violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| I know your plan...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| I remember your plan was very comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| And we really seem to be very focused with this most recent operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| We've, in fact, started putting that into place completely across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| So, yeah, it's actually worked out quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| Counselor De La Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| I just wanted to report that they carded my 92-year-old father-in-law, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| I guess they're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| He looked a little young, but I mean...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| That's very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| I understand that sometimes older people don't want to be carded, but I also understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| the server who makes a mistake is in big trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| Unfortunately, that's the case, but it's necessary in regards to what our plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Well, unless the board has other ideas, I would say that we're satisfied with where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| things are, and please, we don't want to see you again unless you're building another cheddar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| someplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Well, I appreciate that, and we're trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| The first district, aren't you looking for a Cheddar's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| Love to have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| I'd love to have one right next to my house, too, but it hasn't happened yet, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Well, I'll give you the whole district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| It doesn't have to be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Sounds good to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| The only other business before us is that over the course...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=959)|

| 0:16:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| I want to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| I'll wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| So, a lot of business holders have gone out of business, and they forgot that part they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| signed about surrendering their permits when they went out of business, so when that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| that means the law department has to get in the picture and issue a variety of pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=979)|
| 0:16:27| of paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| So, the five...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| The forfeiture thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Is that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| Revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| Revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Formally revoke the permit so it's dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| So, the five businesses have closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| If they apply again for some other permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| So, the five businesses have closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| Their owners now have appointments with the hearing officer in the law department, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| so, basically, there's no action for us to take on this other than to know that we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1011)|
| 0:16:58| probably be getting applications from whoever goes in there once this revocation has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| Meanwhile, wherever those businesses are, no one new can come into that location until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| we have the old permit back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| And so, when people read through the application process, it's easy to just fill in the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1032)|
| 0:17:19| that you have to and not read the fine print, and this is sort of like your credit card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| You really need to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| So, that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| We can give you the names of the five businesses if you'd like, or we don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| How long does the revocation process take, the formal stuff that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| Several weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| I'd say within 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| So, in that interim, no one can get a license for that location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| Because it's in limbo, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| And one of the places, for example, was torn down and is now a Dunkin' Donuts location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| and so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| It's for a beer with your donuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| It's for a beer with your donuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| And there are other places that, when the people came before us, there were, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| Councilman...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Vice Mayor Grieve, speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Well, is Mr. Delavope here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| Are you through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| I'm quite done, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| I see the floor to my colleague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| I wanted to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Well, who notifies these people, I mean, that they do go out of business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| Is that our responsibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| Who sends them a note or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| This is a good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| It's actually their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| When they fill out the application, there's a checkbox that they check either yes or no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| that they are aware of all the beer ordinances, and they promise to comply with that, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| that is actually in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| That 15 days after cessation of operating a beer business, they are to turn in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| And very often, they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| We've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| I think it's appropriate time to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| Fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Are we having a workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| When's the date of that workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| I think it's March the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| That was one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| And then along with that, and maybe this is something we bring up at the workshop, a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| of proprietors of some restaurants had a conversation with me, and apparently there are certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| cities in Tennessee that require everyone to be carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| I don't know if they have an ordinance or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| They weren't sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| But this particular proprietor who has six or seven restaurants in town does require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| and he was just saying you might throw that out for discussion, that really maybe everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| should be carded when they go into a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| So that's for a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| The other thing, I got a couple of emails today from some folks who have liquor stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| and they wanted to know what responsibility the beer board had once these grocery stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| start selling wine and this sort of thing that is, I know it's not beer, but the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| came up, something about the fact that some of the smaller convenience stores may want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| to be starting to open up, and he wanted to know if there was any kind of checks and balances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| And so I don't know, are we going to be inundated, or do we have nothing to do with it, or what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| counselor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| TABC handles the wine sales in grocery stores, convenience stores, and this beer board only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1205)|
| 0:20:12| addresses beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| That's what I told them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| The name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| We might want to address wine someday, but that would not be what TABC wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| We also, there will be some delay as I understand it, unless the legislature acts, and Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1221)|
| 0:20:30| Pavlis, was there any action today on that deal to get the wine in the grocery stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1230)|
| 0:20:39| by July 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| You know, I saw them huddled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| Because apparently the paperwork, sorry, I was just going to interject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| They will be coming before you sitting as City Council, because they have to get a certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| of compliance, and they're coming through our office for that, so we're ready for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| onslaught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| We already have a couple right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| Okay, so it will be City Council that considers those, like we do the beer, the package store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1261)|
| 0:21:08| applications now, but it won't be a beer board function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| Okay, it'll be a City Council function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| So then who confirms the distance and this sort of thing, the requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| The only thing they will give us is a certificate of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| We do need the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| We get records checks on the managers or the owners, it's their choice, and then all we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| give them is the certificate of compliance that they then take to the ABC, and ABC has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| all the rules and regs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| And they take care of the distance requirement in this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| That was a concern that people were talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| Okay, so we will be, City Council will be getting a slew of requests?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| Our office will be putting them on the agenda, or through the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| Those were good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| Councilman Della Voque.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Yeah, I realize we might save this for the actual workshop, but when Duane suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| that maybe we should require everyone to card, it seems to me the bigger problem we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| when people come before us is they look at the card and they ignore the date of birth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| and they slip through the crack, and that seems to be, it seems to be the kind of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| you enforce it in-house that becomes the biggest problem, rather than the action of just handing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| someone a card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| I don't know that that cures anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| Well, we can discuss and cuss that at our workshop, along with two or three other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| that you all want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| Anybody else have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Well, being no other items, this beer board is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160216?start=1351)|
