| 1:33:47| We still discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| that with UT. They still rise. That's on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| radar. They, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| everybody, are kind of waiting to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| how does the geotech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| come out, and then are we going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| where's the lead for the funding going to come for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| this if it's to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5641)|
| 1:34:07| Oh, I'm sorry, Councilman Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| I wondered if there's any update on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| what's known as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| Baptist Hospital site and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| what you're hearing about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| We're in conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| There was an announcement here several months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| that Blanchard Calhoun was in town, looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| took an option. We're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| in conversation with them. They're still in conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| with the hospital, so it's a live project at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| Councilmember Eve. Thank you. That just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| reminded me. What kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| conversations are you having with Tenova| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| over the Old St. Mary's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| Is the city involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| in this with them in trying to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| out what's going to happen there in St. Mary's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| We have not been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| I have not been. I don't think we've really been in touch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| with the Tenova people much on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| They haven't taken the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| official lead, and I have not taken the lead on that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| yet. They've worked their way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| through them. I guess they're transitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| 2,000 Center City jobs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| There's a lot of jobs there. We all understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| that. It's a very serious situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| They're very complicated to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| with, as you all well know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| Expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| I think that's good there. With that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| I'd like for Ann just to give you, I think you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| are fairly updated on Cumberland because we've been coming back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| Council a lot with, but Ann, if you want to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| give a little bit of it, that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| Good morning, Vice Mayor and members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| of Council. I'm really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| excited to see that the Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| project is moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| We anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| getting to a point where we can bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| Phase 1 of the project late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| this summer, which would mean that we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| have a construction start time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| of late this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| Again, Phase 1 would run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| nominally from Alcoa Highway to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| 22nd Street and would not include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| the road diet portion of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| project, but would include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| all of the utilities, the underground work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| all of the necessary infrastructure to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| set the stage for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| future road diet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| It would also include a right-turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| lane onto northbound Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| and some signal upgrades at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| Metrom Way, which would really improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| the traffic flow in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| We felt like that was a real benefit to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| and get this project, or this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| portion of the project underway prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| to the road diet so that folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| leaving the area from either the University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| of Tennessee or the Fort Sanders neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| including the hospitals, will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| direct access out to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| major points west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| That's coming down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| Our budget request included this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| year is $25,000, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| that's a request to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| ask KCDC to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| study a redevelopment area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| for the Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| District, and the purpose behind that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| is to really look at one of the key items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| that was originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| addressed in the Cumberland Avenue corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| study, which is parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| We know that there is a lot of surface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| parking in the area, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| predominantly controlled by private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| landowners, and so we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| be looking at the opportunity to focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| that money towards creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| a redevelopment area to support public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| parking for the district in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| So we're excited to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| moving forward with that as well. I'd be happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| to answer any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| I guess when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| ride down Cumberland right now, aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| from the big hotels that are going up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| and the University Commons thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| I see a lot of empty storefronts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| and I wonder whether we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| freaking out small entrepreneurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| or whether that's just part of the normal activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| but what's going on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| Because I see a lot of empty buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| and I'm a little surprised with all the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| and stuff that we have there. Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| There is a fair amount of turnover that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| One of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| unique challenges of the Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| District is that it very much supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| the student population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| and from what we hear from the Merchants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| Association every month, they've got about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| nine months out of the year to make their quota| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| for sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| which is a very different market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| than we experience in the rest of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| of Knoxville. In addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| we'll be real honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| the generation that's in college now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| is a little fickle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| and their likes and their dislikes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| are changing. It's a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| changing market. You can actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| address that with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| McDonald's Corporation. They've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| a change in their menu selection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| because of the generational change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| with regards to fast food eating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| We're having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| some turnover, but it's not significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| greater than what we've seen in the last five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| that we've been working on building this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| We are excited to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| that there's a lot of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| in the Cumberland Avenue District. In fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| we've got a plan on the table for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| 2010 Cumberland that would be moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| with a mixed-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| retail and residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| proposal coming forward sometime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| later this year. So we're excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| to see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| there's change, but it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| overall we're moving towards growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| Let me go to Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| Well, two things in regards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| to what Mick just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| Turnover among the merchants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| down there has been like this forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| I worked down there back in the 70s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| and it was exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| A lot of people had really good ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| but they just couldn't manage it financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| so they turned over with some frequency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| In regard to the parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| has there ever been any conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| about something akin to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| CBID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| to help fund these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| Yeah, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| In fact, we commissioned the Metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| Planning Commission in 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| to do a study pertaining to parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| not just along the corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| but also out into the Fort Sanders neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| and the district around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| We found that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| on-site parking resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| The management of those resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| both the public and private,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| is very diverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| Getting a strategy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| fund both management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| but also creation of public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| parking spaces where it's consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| and the rates are consistent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| the hours are consistent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| Originally, the study looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| the proposal of a bid district, a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| improvement district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| but recognizing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| we're setting the stage for a lot of incremental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| taxes to be coming forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| with new development in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| the city felt like there's a reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| chance that a TIF increment financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| district would really support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| the development of public parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| much quicker than a bid district would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| That's the option that we're looking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| pursue with KCDC, see if it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| makes sense, see if it works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| do the due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| on that end first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| Let me touch base on two things here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| to follow up on what Ann said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| The TIF district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| this coming Tuesday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| there will be a request in front of you to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| KCDC to begin looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| making the Cumberland Avenue TIF redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| district. I know that's coming your direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| and that is moving to solve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| We think we're heading in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| Secondly, she mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| moving on down the pike. Once again, you'll see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| next Tuesday. There's a pilot request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| there for five years on that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| so we can get our first roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| $15 to $20 million project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| moving on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| Both those things are moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| You just addressed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| That's the student. 2010, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| 2010, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| They're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| For the financing to tighten up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| they're going to need to get through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| and they also still have one process with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| cellar but it's looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| very promising. And you folks are aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| that I was very much concerned about the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6105)|
| 1:41:47| requirements for that and I think it's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| that we need to look at on each development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| that occurs. I think there's a certain amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| that the city does but I think on the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| hand, I think we have to be careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| with the developers coming in, how much leeway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| we give those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| Absolutely. We really reduce the parking on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| that particular structure and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| I'm not so sure that it should be a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| burden totally in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| that we provide parking, public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| parking. I appreciate your concern there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| That's one reason we're moving. We think the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| idea is to move towards the 10th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| Our consultant was in from out of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| Lee Insweiler, talked a lot about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| decoupling. That's pretty much a national| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| trend. We're not requiring all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| parking to be at every development that you try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| to get some sort of parking to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| the district and that's where we think we need to head on Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| Much like the Market Square Mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| garage has done downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| Excuse my voice here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| And that's exactly what I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| to say is that just like Market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| Square, your public parking is what's driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| your development and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| so when I look back at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| $30 million bond issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| and I see nothing like that and I'm going to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| this back up when Rick gets up here and talks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| about downtown. Parking is your biggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6173)|
| 1:42:55| problem and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| it's also your biggest revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| in business generator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| probably the biggest thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| you can do and you've done it before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| and it's proven out to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| the generator to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| property and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| I think when you're looking at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| capital funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| projects like we're doing with this bond issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| I think we'd be remiss not to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| parking, more parking garages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| in Cumberland Avenue and certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| downtown. I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| remiss to, maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| you already have and have looked at it, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| think that's something we really, really need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| to look at. Otherwise, you're going to miss the boat on Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| I think we're right there with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| Councilman. It's just this is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| the right year to get to Cumberland parking garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| and try to get that in the budget because we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| we can get a dedicated funding source if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| move to the TIF district to help us. But it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| eight years since we did a bond issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| or borrowed money, as I'll say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| and you're not doing it every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| year, so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| think you're, and downtown too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| I'm going to bring it up again. I think it's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| there may be one single thing that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| do and that people look for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| the city to address parking issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6243)|
| 1:44:05| and that's the one thing that drives business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| Point taken. Point taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| Thank you. Ms. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| Thanks again for all of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| support and we do have several items that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| will continue to come forward to Council for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| vote and approval and we really appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| the continued support that you've given us on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| We recognize. Councilman Stager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| Thank you, Vice Mayor. I was disappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| to see this morning in the paper that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| the city was buying those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| historic homes in Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| Looks like they're probably going to tear them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| Is that, is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| city taking a position on that or is that something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| No, I don't think we've taken a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| position. We've certainly been in conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| We've been aware of it. Obviously, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| state has power of eminent domain. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| can't regulate the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| That's where we are at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| We have, as Bob says, we've been in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| conversation with them and I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6291)|
| 1:44:53| we've expressed concern about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| that they have their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| building plans and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| so forth and need that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| express from their perspective, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| certainly have had conversation to express concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6303)|
| 1:45:05| about it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6305)|
| 1:45:11| Thanks, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| Downtown is moving along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| well, as you all know, and thanks to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| investment the city's put into downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| This year, we're just asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| the downtown improvement fund and a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| extra there. Most of it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| not spent on real sexy things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| It's garbage screening and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| trying to reduce street clutter with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| newspaper condos and those kinds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| things. I've got a list here of some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| of the things that we've spent money on in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| past. Street lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| tree grates, planters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| multi-meters on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| 100th block of Gay Street. Those were new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| They're about $30,000 for two of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| We've spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| on special event boxes, and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| with Rossini Festival talking about moving, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| probably going to get requested there. Those things are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| $10,000 a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| The money we get there is well spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| and we appreciate everything we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| In the coming year, I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| like to spend some money on some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| fencing. We haven't talked about this very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| much, but the South Central Corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| along the State Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| Garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| it's kind of a neat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| area. I've spent a lot of time, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| down the State Street Garage lately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| particularly down there on Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| You've got a chain-link fence with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| barbed wire all along that stretch, and it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| a prison camp, frankly. We'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| move that thing somehow or another and put a nicer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| fence up, about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| $25 a foot or something like that for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| a nice fence. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| engaged Sarah Hedstrom to do some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| investigation there. It's TDOT-controlled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| property, so we have to get TDOT's permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| In the coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| year, I'd like to create a linear park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| through there, extend the dog park on down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| to the underpass at Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| Some of this money would go to some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| sorts of things if we get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| approved. Certainly street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| lighting, those kinds of things come up quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| often, upgrades to lighting, upgrades to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| utilities. We have our projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| downtown. Anytime we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| have a chance to upgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| service in some way, we spend some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| of the downtown improvement money on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| I'd just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| to get a brief update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| on we had a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| six weeks ago on bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| broadband, more broadband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| to downtown. Is there anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| It is. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6443)|
| 1:47:25| CBID has got a questionnaire that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| we've sent out to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| and I've been asking all the folks I know downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| as well. Our hope there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| at the end of the day is to have a map of downtown to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6453)|
| 1:47:35| broadband service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| Who's got certain speeds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| Who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| feels like they need more capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| At the end of the day, what we'd like to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| create some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| broadband fair, if you want to call it that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| of all the providers to provide that map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| so they can see where their potential customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| are. I've also sat down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| with Comcast recently. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| goodness I haven't been able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| Thankfully, because of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| meeting, I got the Comcast engineers. They just came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| to my office about a week or two ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| to say what can we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| to help provide service downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| Certainly, we have our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| pre-construction meetings anytime we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| a project, and that's the time for those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| to lay some conduit in the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| to prepare for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| AT&T has been pretty good at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| They've been attending Comcast not so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| That's our two major providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| I've also made a couple of calls outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| the city for some other providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| some wireless providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| to see if they're interested in coming in this market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| and looking around. They are, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| It's all customer-driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| We're not in the broadband business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| and don't really intend to get in the broadband business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| nor does KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| The best we can do is try to get the providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| with their customers and figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| how we can make that work best for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| That's the track we're on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. Rick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6535)|
| 1:48:57| you may or may not be the right person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| but you mentioned the Rossini.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| There's been some conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| in the press recently about moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| to Gay Street and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| cease closing Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| for the fairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| and so forth. But in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| they bring such incredible energy downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| and there's so much fun for the participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| like myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| Last weekend is a great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| Now, Gay Street was not closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| but Market Street, by and large, was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| and some of the streets leading into Market Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| Has there been conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| that instead of moving to Henley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| which to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| doesn't make a whole lot of sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| to moving to Market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| to changing some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| large fairs that attract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| an incredible number of people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| I wasn't as involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| in that discussion about moving Rossini,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| although I've been, I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| had knowledge that Rossini,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| that we did want to move them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| We've been trying to promote Depot Street, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| as our venue for those kinds of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| We put special event boxes up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| near the old Southern Railway Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| That whole corridor there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| just primed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| Good wide streets, trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| everything you need for that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| Market Street is just not big enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| for Rossini. I think they've looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| at that before, and I know Judith has probably worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| closer with them on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| I'm not quite sure how they came to Henley Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| how that, I wasn't involved in that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| how they got there. But no, Henley Street doesn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| any power, and that's why I suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| special event boxes. So we're going to have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| if that becomes a venue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| for events, we're going to have to do some work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| down there to make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| Thank you. Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| Well, I'm going to go back to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| And again, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| that there ought to be consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| given to parking garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| We took out, what, $2.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| last year out of our reserves to fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| a parking garage for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| the KUB building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| or TVA building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| over there. And you've got new projects coming on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| We approved a pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| for the old KUB building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| You've got certainly the medical arts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| building's coming on. They have a parking garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| but you've got JCPenney, you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| Arby's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| and White Lily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| All this stuff's coming on. All residential units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| coming downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| And I think we're short-sighted not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| got to, you're doing a bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| issue, you're short-sighted not to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| more parking garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| That's what's driving. People want, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| free parking or parking on a long-term basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| I'll throw that back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| The State Street Garage, you know, we're adding the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| level. It's going to cost us $7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| to do this one level. It's about $3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| a level. And the State Street Garage can support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| two additional levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| based on our parking studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| in that one place there, we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| create another 500 spaces in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| if we so desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| The TVA Garage, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| they're supposed to provide 800 to 1,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| spaces if that comes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| I think it's going to. It's in an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| environmental phase right now as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| which will greatly help downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| The Old City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| folks have talked about parking garages down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| We have the free parking already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| under James White Parkway and at Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| that's very underutilized. What we need there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| is a better trolley system, transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| system to get our folks from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| parking there to where they need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| I think that's one of the challenges, plus the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| Jackson Avenue corridor that Don and Michelle talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| a minute ago. So certainly parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| is a huge thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| You know, I'm fearful that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| as soon as we build the parking level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| that we're going to be full again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| and it's a good thing. We've got all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| development downtown, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| we're constantly thinking about that. And I also know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| the Coliseum, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| Civic Auditorium, 3,000 parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| spaces over there, very underutilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| in the other area that we need to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| some way to get folks more interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| in getting back and forth. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| you know, parking garages are great, but we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| we're just not getting the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| that park there easily into town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| Some of that's changing habits of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| It's easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| to put a parking spot in their way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| as opposed to trying to change their habits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| A lot of the parking downtown is employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| we're finding out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| business owners and residents. And they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| only park there. They're there and they're there for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| days. And if we could get those folks to maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6789)|

| 1:53:13| auditorium or in the free parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| a lot of cities have done this, Chattanooga, Lexington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| some of those places, have a really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6797)|
| 1:53:19| transit system with an encouragement of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| folks to park there, which then frees up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| the spaces for customers downtown. So we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6803)|
| 1:53:25| to figure out how to get that mix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| better, you know, better going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| Councilman Stare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| Vice Mayor. That answers part of my question. I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6813)|
| 1:53:35| on two sort of updates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| with the TVA garage, will there be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| process where the public will be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| comment on the design of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| garage? I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| they promised that, but I'm not as familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| with that as maybe Bill. Yeah, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| they will take, I believe where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| we are now is that would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| through the downtown design review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| It's not binding on them, but that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| a public, you know, a chance for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| public response on that. That's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| understanding right now of what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| And what is the timeline on that garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| Do we have any idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| Well, they're in the cultural resources review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| right now. And I don't know what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| you know, how long that's going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| And there haven't been any contracts let or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| But, I mean, it's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| I think should happen sooner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| rather than later. That is, you know, it's moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| now, but it's all these processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| are very slow because you're, you have to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| through the entire, because they're using federal funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| to do that entire cultural resources review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| which takes quite a while, and which just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| actually the fence just went up for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| So that's underway. And not only that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| they found something. So they're going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| excavate and study the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| that was found close to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| garage structure. So there's going to be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| extra work being done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| Got a house with an Indian in it, underground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| No, a later generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6889)|
| 1:54:51| No, but it was a pushover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| at one time as opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| clear it out. So they found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| something, which slows it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| And then my other question was an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| on the wayfinding project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| Ann?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| Sure. Very pleased to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| you all know that we have received our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| environmental clearance for the downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| wayfinding project, and we have actually submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| our request to TDOT for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| right-of-way approval. Of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| those signs will be located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| within the existing right-of-way of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6919)|
| 1:55:21| so we anticipate a fairly quick and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| speedy review by TDOT for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| that right-of-way process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| We are still on track to be able to bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| that project by the end of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| and see construction going next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| We still have good support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| The sign package is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| largely intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| Obviously, when you move from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| city funds to TDOT funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| there's a change in some of the guidelines that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| have to follow, but we've been able to address most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| of all of those concerns pretty quickly with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| TDOT. So we're looking forward to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| under construction first of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6953)|
| 1:55:59| I just question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| sort of a motion to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| the budget. We have a schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| from 830 to noon without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| a short break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| somewhere in there. Some of us are older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| That's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| A camel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| made this schedule or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6975)|
| 1:56:21| Whenever is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| I was going to do it after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| Vice Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| Bob, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| isn't the focus of this year's budget, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| I'd be remiss if I didn't encourage some attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| towards the north of downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| North. That doesn't stop at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| Woodland, and we've got a lot of opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| there, people concerned with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| crime and plight of properties along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7001)|
| 1:56:43| that corridor, and hopefully next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| we'll see something in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| I appreciate that, Mark. I'm glad you mentioned north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| Let me real quickly, because it's not on the sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| Our Gay Street project is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| bid right now between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| Magnolia and Fifth Avenue. We're hopeful to get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| done this summer. The North Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7017)|
| 1:56:59| Street project is still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| in the middle of its cultural reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| environmental phase, because there's three historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| districts out there on Central Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| that you've got to work your way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| Then the 275 Road project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| the environmental document has been submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| for that one, so there is progress on all three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| of those public improvement projects in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| with no new funding requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| The north of Woodland out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| to the Inskip area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| through Oakwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| and Lincoln Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7045)|
| 1:57:27| it's a challenging area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| The conference was going to call these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| gray fields. It's a gray field out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| There's a lot of businesses come and go, a lot of service stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| the heat and air people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| There's a lot of issues out there. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| Certainly, there are good businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| Rankin Restaurant and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| Keith Window. There's people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| want to hang on in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| but they don't see a lot coming that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| Of course, with interest with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| Helen Ross McNabb expansion possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| and crime interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| in Oakwood and Lincoln Park, people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| getting their money there, but we want to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| some improvement hopefully. I understand your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| Yes, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7081)|
| 1:58:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| Susanna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7087)|

| 1:58:55| Thanks for coming here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7135)|

| 1:59:03| You may have been here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| and heard the discussion. We were talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| mostly about the downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| going out towards the Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| Corridor. There was the issue of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| how does this city work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| better with all of the merchants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| that are out in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| by East Town Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| There's literally dozens of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| businesses out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| They generate $2.6 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| in property tax and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| at least a million and a half to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| $2 million in city tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| and they're struggling with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| visibility from the interstate and the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| issues that go with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| and the signage. Is there anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| the chamber can do to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| work with those group of businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| to get them, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| on a better footing because it's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| important commercial area. It's obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| beyond the community development groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| or policy groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| focus right now, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| is there something the chamber can do in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| partnering with these folks to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| make that a healthier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7203)|
| 2:00:05| economic climate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| I think, I mean, certainly we'll work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| with the groups as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| they request and need to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7211)|
| 2:00:13| We've been working, Simon Properties, the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7213)|
| 2:00:15| who's in charge of that, we spend a lot of time working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7215)|
| 2:00:17| them and talking about that area and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| things that might be used to help for marketing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| to get more potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| visitors to that area, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| Councilwoman, I mean, it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| it's kind of spread out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| and there's not one central group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| focusing on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| you've got the mall and then you've got Harvest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7233)|
| 2:00:35| Park and all that kind of stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| so perhaps if they could come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| and kind of think about some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7239)|
| 2:00:41| that they might do as a broad group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7241)|
| 2:00:43| but we'd be certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| happy to work with them in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| Would you be willing to sponsor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| a get together of the major businesses there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| at the chamber or something? Absolutely, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| So they could contact you or who would they contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| to maybe have a sort of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| brainstorming meeting or something and get those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| business leaders together in one room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7259)|
| 2:01:01| kind of thing and work with the chamber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| Let me start with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| Simon Properties contacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| and see if they might have other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| contacts with some of those. Well, Tim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| Graham, for example, has all those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| on the west side of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| I know he's interested. I've talked to John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| Ferris who has the McDonald's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| There's a Tommy Van who has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| that Van Land thing down by Loves Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| but we ought to get all those people in the room, the Walmart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| people, and see if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| can together collectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7287)|
| 2:01:29| tell you their concerns and figure out how to solve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7289)|
| 2:01:31| some of the problems. We'd be happy to host that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| I didn't know if you could be a good host for that. We'd be glad to host that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| Okay, well thank you. Would they contact you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| Sure. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| Let's take a, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| 1030 by my watch, let's take about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| a 10 minute break and resume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| God bless you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7307)|
| 2:01:59| All right, Office of Sustainability is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| the last one listed under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7321)|
| 2:02:03| Mayor's Office on page two of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7325)|
| 2:02:07| I'm going to be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| You guys know our history a little bit. I'm just going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| reiterate that in 2009 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7331)|
| 2:02:13| 2011 we were federally funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| We have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| locally funded in 12, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7337)|
| 2:02:19| was an excellent year for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| Primarily because we didn't have to jump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| and step to the federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| agenda and priorities, but we could make our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| own. And so we watched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7347)|
| 2:02:29| the funding shift from a federal level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| and a national level to more of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| local level, and we found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7353)|
| 2:02:35| that foundations all across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| are very much investing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| urban sustainability issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| So in 2012 we brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| in over $400,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| in unmatched resources to the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| Knoxville. We fully anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7367)|
| 2:02:49| these types of opportunities to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| and we fully anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| chasing them. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7373)|
| 2:02:55| kind of my summary. I'll take questions now if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7375)|
| 2:02:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| Yeah, would you tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| us a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| your objectives going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| what you see as the big picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| focuses going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| Certainly. In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| 2011 we published our first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| Energy and Sustainability Work Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| and 24 of those 33| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| activities are completed or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7399)|
| 2:03:21| are in process right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7401)|
| 2:03:23| which means that we've started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| the last 8 to 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7405)|
| 2:03:27| months compiling all of our energy data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| again in an effort to update our energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| baseline. That's your ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| mission? You've got new things coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| It helps us set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7415)|
| 2:03:37| our priorities. So when we see funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7417)|
| 2:03:39| opportunities come up, we can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| okay, 36% of our emissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| come from buildings. We need building funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| and we need building initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| So our data helps us set our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| And out of that we're also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7429)|
| 2:03:51| revamping the work plan to set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| goals, because we've met some of our goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| so we're setting new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| And from a big picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7437)|
| 2:03:59| perspective, in 2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| we've watched the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| sort of start up with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7443)|
| 2:04:05| infusion of federal funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| at a federal agenda. We've watched it turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| into a local initiative, and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| 2013 we're entering it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7451)|
| 2:04:13| as a mature office with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| set goals and ways of getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7455)|
| 2:04:17| to them and actual percentages of the carbon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| that we're reducing from each activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| So we're focusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| very much on transit and buildings right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7463)|
| 2:04:25| because they're our largest contributors to air quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| when you say the word sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| you mean environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| improvements? What do you mean by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| Sustainability is a three-tiered stool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| It deals with economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| social equity, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| also environment. And so when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7481)|
| 2:04:43| evaluate an initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7483)|
| 2:04:45| that we want to get involved with, we look at it from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| all three of those lenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| So we ask, does it make financial sense for the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| Does it make social sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| Are we helping our weakest links here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| Because we're not stronger than our weakest links.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7495)|
| 2:04:57| And finally, we're asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| what does this do to impact our local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7499)|
| 2:05:01| environmental quality? Are we improving it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| with this? So essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| it's about the way that Knoxville grows as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| city. Are we growing responsibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| and smart from those three perspectives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| Alright, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| We will move right along to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| To find Charles' budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| in the handout, it's page 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| and I believe he's also going to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| risk management fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| which is page 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| That's the one he's inherited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7535)|
| 2:05:39| Good morning, Mr. Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7539)|
| 2:05:41| members of council. I'm Charles Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| I am honored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| to represent a group of fine lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7545)|
| 2:05:47| in the law department and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| a great staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| and a group of fine people in risk management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| What we have discovered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| is that while we have great lawyers in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| law department, their boss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7559)|
| 2:06:01| is not all that good at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| lobbying, because as I look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7563)|
| 2:06:05| at our budget, it's pretty much the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7565)|
| 2:06:07| blooming budget we had last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| Despite all my efforts to get new carpet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| and better furniture and all those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| we don't have money for it, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| we're going to stick with the budget we had last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7575)|
| 2:06:17| And we'll hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7577)|
| 2:06:19| to provide good legal services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| to the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| with that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7583)|
| 2:06:25| I would like to explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7585)|
| 2:06:27| to you that we have had a little difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7587)|
| 2:06:29| in the law department since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| it sort of makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| that what the law department does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| is it handles liabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7599)|
| 2:06:41| potential liabilities from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| the city's point of view, claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| against the city. That's what the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7605)|
| 2:06:47| does. And what we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| in risk management was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7609)|
| 2:06:51| a group of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| with sort of different missions put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| There was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| benefits group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| of folks who were working in risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| management, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| what we really found was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| they were working on behalf of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| employees, and our employees are not liabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| They are major assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| And so in dividing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| that up in a more logical fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| it seemed to make sense to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| the claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| and workers' compensation folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| group that would be working as sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7643)|
| 2:07:25| a division of the law department, which is where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| they used to be a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7647)|
| 2:07:29| Some of you know that in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| of my previous lives, I worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7651)|
| 2:07:33| in the city law department back in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7653)|
| 2:07:35| early 1980s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7655)|
| 2:07:37| during the World's Fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7657)|
| 2:07:39| and at that period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7659)|
| 2:07:41| risk management was a part of the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| And then over time with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| one mayor or another, risk management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7665)|
| 2:07:47| got moved out of the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7667)|
| 2:07:49| and then into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| finance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7671)|
| 2:07:53| but now risk management has come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| home to the law department where it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| belongs, and we're glad to have them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| As you look at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| budget, you really see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7681)|
| 2:08:03| only increases that are there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| for compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| There's some adjustment with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| Westlaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| To add a little money, and really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| we've rearranged where Westlaw is paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| out of what fund. Westlaw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| is a very expensive thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| and if it were just up to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| it wouldn't be as expensive because I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| how to use it as well as these young lawyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7707)|
| 2:08:29| but these young lawyers can't practice law without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| computer research. And frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| they're not able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| to compete with their peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7715)|
| 2:08:37| in the law if they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7717)|
| 2:08:39| have that asset and you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| them to have it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| I do the research and they tell me what they find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| So that's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7725)|
| 2:08:47| I get the benefit of having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| that computer research and not having to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| So we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| got to have that. We've got the minute track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| system in there, and that costs us a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7735)|
| 2:08:57| every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| I think we're going to get this minute track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| system worked out so that it works well for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7741)|
| 2:09:03| you all and works well for us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| So that's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| the only adjustments in our budget that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| will find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| In the risk management portion, I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| Kirk Ryden here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| from risk management to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| you may have with regard to risk management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| Gary Easties is not able to be with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7759)|
| 2:09:21| us today because he's out traveling somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| learning something or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| either teaching or learning something to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7765)|
| 2:09:27| with our claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7767)|
| 2:09:29| handling for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| So Kirk is here to answer any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| questions you may have with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| I will tell you that workers' comp is down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| and claims are down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| So that's always a good sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| in the current economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| and litigation climate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| Any questions from anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7785)|
| 2:09:47| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| Hey, Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| You brought in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| tax lawyer into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7793)|
| 2:09:55| your group, the property tax lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| How are we doing with catching up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| some of those arrearages? Are we getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| closer to being current?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| Because I know that that was a great sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| coup to find this guy buried in the stack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| and you got him kind of teamed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| with your guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| Yeah, we're going very well with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| And we've recently had a tax sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| where we had some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| adjustments to the state law to allow us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| to do some things that allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| both the county government and the city government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| to forgive each other's taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| when the property was upside down and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| like that. And we've recently had a tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| sale that frankly brought in a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| money than we anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| that it might. So we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| moving forward with those little parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| of property. Most of those parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| were purchased, as you might imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| by adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| I am told that maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| from time to time when we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| selling that property we got into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| little bidding war between adjacent property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| owners. From the city of Knoxville's perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7851)|
| 2:10:53| that was a very good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| It is moving well and we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| continuing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| decrease the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| of unpaid property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| Good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7865)|
| 2:11:09| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7871)|
| 2:11:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| We will move into civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7877)|
| 2:11:23| Civil service is page 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| of the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7885)|
| 2:11:29| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| I want to say very little about my actual budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7891)|
| 2:11:33| It's very uninteresting, small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7893)|
| 2:11:35| and we've pretty well held with the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7895)|
| 2:11:37| budget for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7897)|
| 2:11:39| The only thing I did want to point out is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| it's been one of my goals since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| becoming the director to make our department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| And since then we've gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7907)|
| 2:11:49| from 15 staff and this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7909)|
| 2:11:51| we actually reduced down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| a little farther where I've taken the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| department to 10 staff and I've done that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7915)|
| 2:11:57| voluntarily as we've been able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| I wanted to mention that one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| you guys funded last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| invested some money to go online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| with our applications. And while we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| still working through some hiccups on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| that, it has been very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| successful. It has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| tremendously increased our efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| and that's what allowed me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| to actually reduce an additional position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| which was one of the things I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7941)|
| 2:12:23| agreed up front we would probably be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| to do in exchange for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| funding for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| We actually gave some positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| to benefits, the new benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7951)|
| 2:12:33| department. They needed them and we didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| so we made that transition with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| year's budget. I was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7957)|
| 2:12:39| to focus my comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7959)|
| 2:12:41| more on the class comp issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7961)|
| 2:12:43| because those are probably what I bring more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| to the budget. We have the class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| comp ordinance before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7967)|
| 2:12:49| Just to give you a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| brief summary on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| salary survey, you guys should have all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7973)|
| 2:12:55| gotten a copy of that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7975)|
| 2:12:57| it's on the intranet if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| you need to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7979)|
| 2:13:01| We usually send that to about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7981)|
| 2:13:03| a little over 100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7983)|
| 2:13:05| participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| That list was developed by Mercer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| back when we did the comprehensive survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7989)|
| 2:13:11| We got 45 respondents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7991)|
| 2:13:13| this year representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| 13 states and we send those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| states throughout the southeast and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| midwest so it's a pretty big group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| About one third of those were from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| Tennessee with about 30 of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| them being from the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| 12 states that responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| On this year's survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8009)|
| 2:13:31| one thing I wanted to point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8011)|
| 2:13:33| out because it is a little confusing, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| when employee groups come and speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| to you guys, the data they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8017)|
| 2:13:39| sometimes looks different than the data I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8019)|
| 2:13:41| have. When I get that survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| data, I actually do my own analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| to make a determination on what if any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| changes to bring to you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8027)|
| 2:13:49| and when I do that, what I'm looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| for general government, you'll notice in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8031)|
| 2:13:53| survey itself, you just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| have responses for the job classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| that we survey. I actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| aggregate those in my own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| data so that I can get sort of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8041)|
| 2:14:03| representation of what that pay grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| looks like. So all of the jobs within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| a given pay grade, I'll aggregate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| data for my own purposes to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| based on that data, what would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| be that midpoint if you group them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| all together and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| how do we look relative to that midpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| On general government, we don't make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| any adjustments. We actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8061)|
| 2:14:23| take the survey midpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| and compare it to our own midpoint to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8065)|
| 2:14:27| what percent of difference we have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8067)|
| 2:14:29| On Uniformed, I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8069)|
| 2:14:31| the same thing for each rank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8071)|
| 2:14:33| that we survey. The difference there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| is I actually adjust that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| If you remember, back when we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8077)|
| 2:14:39| Mercer, Mercer gave us a 5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| benefit, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| on Uniformed given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| the richness of their benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| So their benefit package actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| sort of added 5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| to our compensation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8091)|
| 2:14:53| it was their recommendation and that's how they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| did the survey when they did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| That's why the number looks a little different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| and sometimes employees aren't sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| why my number looks different. I'm actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| giving it that 5% adjustment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| until we have a reason not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| So it actually gets a 5% adjustment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| before I make that comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| And then again, I look to see what's the percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| of difference. What I'm looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| ideally is that we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8115)|
| 2:15:17| to be within about 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| To me, if it's high or low, 5%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| I see that much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| fluctuation from year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| So I don't want to make a knee-jerk reaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| and change something based on something smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8127)|
| 2:15:29| than 5%. When we start getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| differences that are greater than 5%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| then I watch for a trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8133)|
| 2:15:35| If that continues over a multi-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| period, that's when I suggest an adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8137)|
| 2:15:39| So I just want you to sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8139)|
| 2:15:41| know my thinking process and how I'm looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| at that and why some things come to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8143)|
| 2:15:45| and others don't. So in looking at it this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8145)|
| 2:15:47| year, fire, we look very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| Fire looked great. We only had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| one rank that I didn't consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8151)|
| 2:15:53| to be in the acceptable range, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| Assistant Chief. I've been watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8155)|
| 2:15:57| fire for several years. We actually had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| a downward trend for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| We made some targeted adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8161)|
| 2:16:03| We gave some additional increases in fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8163)|
| 2:16:05| last year that absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| reversed that trend. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| right now, the only one that's still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| lower than I would like to see it as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8171)|
| 2:16:13| Assistant Chief, but we actually cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8173)|
| 2:16:15| that difference in half. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8175)|
| 2:16:17| I do expect we're talking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| the Chief about some additional changes to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| structure in fire that we're going to explore this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| year, possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| including some new ranks, so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| we mirror other municipalities more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| closely. Most of them have about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8189)|
| 2:16:31| two ranks more than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8191)|
| 2:16:33| And I think that if we do that, you'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8193)|
| 2:16:35| more promotional opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8195)|
| 2:16:37| on the lower end, and it'll, over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8197)|
| 2:16:39| get those salaries up once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| you get to that higher end. So we already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| have a plan in place to address that, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| I didn't make any recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8205)|
| 2:16:47| there. Police, we look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8207)|
| 2:16:49| great. We're starting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8209)|
| 2:16:51| dip a little low on the upper ranks there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| as well, Captain and Deputy Chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| but it's a new trend. It's not something I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| seen in the past, so it's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| I would want to see a multi-year trend before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| we made a suggestion to adjust it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| General Government is the only place I made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| a recommended change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| We were low on Pay Grades 1 and 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| lower than I would like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| So we actually did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8231)|
| 2:17:13| I put in about a 5% increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| on Pay Grade 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| The cost of that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8237)|
| 2:17:19| a little, given the incumbent employees that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| would have to be raised to the new minimum, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8241)|
| 2:17:23| a little under $40,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8243)|
| 2:17:25| in base salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| And that, over time, that'll kick up Pay Grade 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| So I didn't make any recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| for Pay Grade 2. So that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8251)|
| 2:17:33| the only structured change you see is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8253)|
| 2:17:35| Pay Grade 1 in General Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8255)|
| 2:17:37| And that's about a 5% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8257)|
| 2:17:39| So, right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| the survey looks good. It's showing us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| almost on everything to be in the acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| range where we'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| to see it. I did want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| make a couple of comments about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8269)|
| 2:17:51| the proposal to do another comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| survey, go out to a consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8273)|
| 2:17:55| this year. We had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8275)|
| 2:17:57| made a commitment to do that approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| every five years. I think we're actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8279)|
| 2:18:01| in our sixth year, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| it's very important that we stick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| with that and that at least every five or six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8285)|
| 2:18:07| years we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8287)|
| 2:18:09| So it's been about six years since we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8289)|
| 2:18:11| did Mercer. It would allow us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8291)|
| 2:18:13| to ensure we're still on target. Our survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8293)|
| 2:18:15| is smaller in scale than what a consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8295)|
| 2:18:17| can do for us. They have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| a broader reach. They can get more data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8299)|
| 2:18:21| They can get better data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| And they can do a benefits valuation, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8303)|
| 2:18:25| something we can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8305)|
| 2:18:27| So it's a good thing to do. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8307)|
| 2:18:29| still, we have a few hiccups left over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8309)|
| 2:18:31| from Mercer. It created a few inequities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8311)|
| 2:18:33| we didn't expect, and this would give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| an opportunity to look at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| and see if any of those need to be corrected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| and get some recommendations on how to correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8319)|
| 2:18:41| them. And it would also give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| us another chance to see if that 5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| benefit valuation for Uniformed is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| still holding or whether we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| take a second look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| And it also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| I'm hopeful that it might even help us with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| development of the new fire structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| that we're considering trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8337)|
| 2:18:59| this year. So those are the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8339)|
| 2:19:01| comments I have. Happy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8341)|
| 2:19:03| answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8343)|
| 2:19:05| Questions? Oh, we got questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| On your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| survey, is this just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8351)|
| 2:19:13| of other like public entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8353)|
| 2:19:15| or do we involve ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| with the private sector and try to get some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| comparative? We try to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| private data, but private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| companies will not typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8363)|
| 2:19:25| disclose their data because they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| have to. And they consider it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| you know, it hurts them, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8369)|
| 2:19:31| in the competitive world. They don't want their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| competitors to know what they pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| We did have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8375)|
| 2:19:37| Usually we don't get any. Barge Wagner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| actually responded to this year's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| survey, so we were able to get a little bit of private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| data. But we do try. We include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8383)|
| 2:19:45| about ten private entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| but they rarely respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| Well, when we go with the survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| company, do they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8391)|
| 2:19:53| get some of that private data? They do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| have a better ability to get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8395)|
| 2:19:57| private data because they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8397)|
| 2:19:59| if it's similar to what Mercer did, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8399)|
| 2:20:01| and I can't speak for every consultant, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8401)|
| 2:20:03| modeling the way Mercer did it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| they sent out a custom survey for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8405)|
| 2:20:07| and that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| this group that we send ours to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| came from. We're using the same group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8411)|
| 2:20:13| that they used because it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8413)|
| 2:20:15| very representative. We sort of sat right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| in the middle, gave us a really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| representative group to compare ourselves to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| so we've continued to use the same list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8421)|
| 2:20:23| But they also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| databases full of data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| because companies hire them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| to do surveys. So if a private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| company, they have multitudes of private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| companies that hire them, they then have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8433)|
| 2:20:35| all of those companies' data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| So we had a second part that Mercer brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| to the table in that they had this wealth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| of data they already had. And they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| then matched our jobs to that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| they already had, which did bring in a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| private data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8449)|
| 2:20:51| Councilman DelVal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| Yes, thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| Yes, I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| asking this earlier of, I guess, maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| Jim York, but let me try it on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| Do you see the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8461)|
| 2:21:03| of, well, let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| The wage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| portion of our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| that includes wages and fringes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| and pensions and all those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| is the lion's share of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| It's over $109 million out of $180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| Do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| see any possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| of having differentials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| to automatic increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8483)|
| 2:21:25| so that, for example, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8485)|
| 2:21:27| took people that earned under $40,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| or $45,000 and gave them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| a set cost of living increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| that we might look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| people in the higher pay scales as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| getting more of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| discretionary adjustment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| based on, you know, available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| revenue, performance bonuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| whatever else we do, but somehow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| take everything out of autopilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| because the forecast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| going forward for the next five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| is that money might get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| tighter in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| flat-lined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| property and sales tax and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8519)|
| 2:22:01| else, and we want to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8521)|
| 2:22:03| our powder where it will do the most good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8523)|
| 2:22:05| and help the people best. Do you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8525)|
| 2:22:07| that as inconsistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8527)|
| 2:22:09| what you do in looking at classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8529)|
| 2:22:11| or ways of compensating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8531)|
| 2:22:13| our employees? I'd say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8533)|
| 2:22:15| probably would be something you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8535)|
| 2:22:17| see in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8537)|
| 2:22:19| As far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8539)|
| 2:22:21| whether or not other municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8541)|
| 2:22:23| do that, I don't know. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8543)|
| 2:22:25| definitely something. It would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8545)|
| 2:22:27| very easy to have M-TAS. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| really great about doing any kind of little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| survey like that we need and kind of checking with everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8551)|
| 2:22:33| else in Tennessee. It would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8553)|
| 2:22:35| very easy to find out if anyone else does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| something like that. M-TAS is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| plugged into all the other municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| They have a database too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8561)|
| 2:22:43| We have a really good contact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| Rick Stopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8565)|
| 2:22:47| He wears two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8567)|
| 2:22:49| hats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8569)|
| 2:22:51| He works for M-TAS, but he's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8571)|
| 2:22:53| a very active member of the Tennessee Personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8573)|
| 2:22:55| Management Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8575)|
| 2:22:57| On both of those levels, he's able to get us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8577)|
| 2:22:59| a lot of good data. It's something we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8579)|
| 2:23:01| ask him to just see if anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8581)|
| 2:23:03| else does anything like that. Have you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8583)|
| 2:23:05| seen anything in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8585)|
| 2:23:07| public sector work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8587)|
| 2:23:09| whether it's in Tennessee or Kentucky or elsewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8589)|
| 2:23:11| where they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| temporary freezes of adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8593)|
| 2:23:15| or COLA adjustments or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8595)|
| 2:23:17| other things where budgetary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8597)|
| 2:23:19| constraints are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8599)|
| 2:23:21| affecting the municipality? Because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| option is to go out and either borrow money or tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8603)|

| 2:23:27| We haven't looked at it this year, but I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| that a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| of years ago, I think maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8611)|
| 2:23:33| two years in a row, we actually did do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| survey with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| many of our peers to see what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| were doing. And if memory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8619)|
| 2:23:41| serves, probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| about half of them were freezing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8623)|
| 2:23:45| They were freezing their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8625)|
| 2:23:47| cost of living adjustments. Just to make ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| meet, so to speak. So that's not uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| That's not uncommon. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8631)|
| 2:23:53| Have you looked around other areas to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| see whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| employees could put in an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8637)|
| 2:23:59| percentage point in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| pension plan or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| That's not something I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8643)|
| 2:24:05| heard of. I'm not familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| with that. Not in the public sector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8647)|
| 2:24:09| Not to say no one does it. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8649)|
| 2:24:11| unaware. Okay. Well, thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| Mayor Brown? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| Ms. Hadfield, the program where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| students come in, are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8657)|
| 2:24:19| still doing that? Could you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| tell us a little bit about that? We are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| and we're in the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| process right now. We're getting applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8665)|
| 2:24:27| We got a good number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8667)|
| 2:24:29| Do you know how many departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| have signed on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8671)|
| 2:24:33| Almost every department has agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8673)|
| 2:24:35| to host an intern. We're taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8675)|
| 2:24:37| applications. I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8677)|
| 2:24:39| interviews, I think we usually do those in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8679)|
| 2:24:41| early June, and we try to bring the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8681)|
| 2:24:43| to work for a month in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8683)|
| 2:24:45| and we actually got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| permission to double| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| the hours. In the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| they've only worked 10 hours a week, which was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8691)|
| 2:24:53| really difficult to find something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8693)|
| 2:24:55| meaningful for them to do, and everybody here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| knows coming to the city county building for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8697)|
| 2:24:59| a few hours is, you spend that much time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8699)|
| 2:25:01| trying to get in here. So, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8701)|
| 2:25:03| give them more hours, so we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| are going to give them 20 hours this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| year, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| so we're hopeful that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| that's going to be a permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| program that we can continue for some time. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8713)|
| 2:25:15| been very rewarding for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8715)|
| 2:25:17| and for the employees, for the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8717)|
| 2:25:19| that have participated. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8719)|
| 2:25:21| Councilman Wallace, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| two quick questions. One, for the comparative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| study, you do an RFP for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| that, and then is Mercer is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| company that would, they'd quote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| that? We would hope that they, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8731)|
| 2:25:33| just my thought is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8733)|
| 2:25:35| because they have already done it for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| in the past, they've sort of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8737)|
| 2:25:39| they already know what we do, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8739)|
| 2:25:41| they've already got, you know, they've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| developed a custom survey for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8743)|
| 2:25:45| and so, yeah, ideally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8745)|
| 2:25:47| you know, they would be interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8747)|
| 2:25:49| in at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| vying for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8751)|
| 2:25:53| One of the concerns last year in the pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8753)|
| 2:25:55| discussions were that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| if we change this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8757)|
| 2:25:59| if we change the pension plan dramatically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8759)|
| 2:26:01| it would put us at a competitive disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8761)|
| 2:26:03| Has there been enough time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8763)|
| 2:26:05| see if that is true or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8765)|
| 2:26:07| or have you seen any pushback from new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8767)|
| 2:26:09| applicants so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8769)|
| 2:26:11| Honestly, I don't know that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8771)|
| 2:26:13| applicants know the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| I'd say where that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| would really come in more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| would be in retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8779)|
| 2:26:21| I don't think we're really going to see it in applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| People looking for a job are looking for a job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8783)|
| 2:26:25| and if you've got a job, they're going to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| for it. What we do notice is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| that five-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8789)|
| 2:26:31| vesting, it was a hook. I mean, it really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| was a hook. I've heard a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| employees that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| the skill sets to go virtually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| anywhere say, once I got that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| fifth year in, I was hooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| Now I can't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| That's what I would expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| to see, that maybe we won't have that hook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| and we won't be able to retain them as long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| Right now, our turnover is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| significantly lower than any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| of our peers. We've been hanging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| around three, the low 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| I think even the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| state average is probably around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8823)|
| 2:27:05| Our turnover is very good. So far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| we haven't seen any change in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| Are you seeing in any of the more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| professional-type positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| whether it's engineers or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| others, lawyers, whatever, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| area where you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| compete or you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| losing talent that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| really want to keep? In other words, is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| a problem that you see in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8849)|
| 2:27:31| more skilled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8851)|
| 2:27:33| workers, so to speak? No more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| so than we've always had a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8857)|
| 2:27:39| One that sticks in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8859)|
| 2:27:41| mind because it's recent is engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8861)|
| 2:27:43| We've always had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| a harder time recruiting. The higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| the position, the harder it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8867)|
| 2:27:49| to recruit. But so far, we've always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| been very lucky. All you need is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| one applicant. If you get that one good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| applicant and there's one good qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8875)|
| 2:27:57| person that you can hire and they want the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8877)|
| 2:27:59| But, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8879)|
| 2:28:01| for Traffic Engineering Chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| I think we had...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| John Hunter was, for example. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8885)|
| 2:28:07| And John Hunter, my understanding is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8887)|
| 2:28:09| he got a job offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| that there was no way we could compete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| with. So that's why we lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| him. And then trying to replace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8895)|
| 2:28:17| him, I believe we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| to post it twice. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8899)|
| 2:28:21| open for an extremely long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| And we still, I think we might have only gotten three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| applicants. It's a very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| job to fill. On the flip side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8907)|
| 2:28:29| do you see professionals out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8909)|
| 2:28:31| there that might be nearing the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8911)|
| 2:28:33| of their career and they would bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8913)|
| 2:28:35| some wealth of knowledge, but they really don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8915)|
| 2:28:37| to travel around the country and be on the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8917)|
| 2:28:39| all the time when they're looking for a more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| secure kind of local job. In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| other words, are you getting skill sets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| that come in looking for a municipal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8925)|
| 2:28:47| job rather than a whirlwind tour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8927)|
| 2:28:49| That's what we get. And it's funny, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8929)|
| 2:28:51| actually, you know, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8931)|
| 2:28:53| new Traffic Engineering Chief is someone that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8933)|
| 2:28:55| had retired from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| New York. He worked with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8937)|
| 2:28:59| New York DOT and had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8939)|
| 2:29:01| retired and moved down here and still wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8941)|
| 2:29:03| to work. So he brings a really valuable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8943)|
| 2:29:05| skill set. So yes, we do tend to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| make up for maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8947)|
| 2:29:09| what we lack in pay, in working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8949)|
| 2:29:11| conditions and environment. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8951)|
| 2:29:13| an engineer in the private sector is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| expected to bring in clients, probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8955)|
| 2:29:17| going to be working 60, 70, 80| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8957)|
| 2:29:19| hours a week. So certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8959)|
| 2:29:21| they make more, but the working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| environment is different. We're going to attract people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| who... They might want to be buying leisure time instead of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8965)|
| 2:29:27| We're going to attract people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8967)|
| 2:29:29| you know, value their family time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| and want to come in and do a more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8971)|
| 2:29:33| reasonable schedule and have more time at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8973)|
| 2:29:35| with their families. That's the tradeoff. And don't travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| and... So you're pursuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8977)|
| 2:29:39| that angle as well. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8979)|
| 2:29:41| Any further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8981)|
| 2:29:43| questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8983)|
| 2:29:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| Alec?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8987)|
| 2:29:49| Mr. McKay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8989)|
| 2:29:51| For this fund, if you'll look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8991)|
| 2:29:53| on page 27 of the handout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8993)|
| 2:29:55| are pages 87 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| 88 under the budget detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8997)|
| 2:29:59| tab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=8999)|
| 2:30:03| It's fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9003)|

| 2:30:19| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| Greg McKay with the Public Assembly Facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| Thanks for having me this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9023)|
| 2:30:25| As you well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| know, I'm relatively new at this, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9027)|
| 2:30:29| I'm relying on the help of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9029)|
| 2:30:31| Mr. York. There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| Dale Dunn is here if you have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| about the Coliseum. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9035)|
| 2:30:37| what we're doing this year is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9037)|
| 2:30:39| you know, we're trying to do what we can to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9039)|
| 2:30:41| increase revenue at both places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9041)|
| 2:30:43| We're looking at having possibly an outdoor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9043)|
| 2:30:45| venue at the Coliseum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9045)|
| 2:30:47| sometime late in the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9047)|
| 2:30:49| early in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9049)|
| 2:30:51| We also are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9051)|
| 2:30:53| our best. We have several vacancies at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9053)|
| 2:30:55| both facilities that we're using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9055)|
| 2:30:57| part-time people when we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9057)|
| 2:30:59| particularly at the ticket booths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9059)|
| 2:31:01| because we just don't have the demand that we used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9061)|
| 2:31:03| to because of the Internet and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9063)|
| 2:31:05| ticketing concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| Ticketmaster and things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9067)|
| 2:31:09| that. And we're just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9069)|
| 2:31:11| you know, making do with less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9071)|
| 2:31:13| as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9073)|
| 2:31:15| If you've got any questions, I'll be glad to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9075)|
| 2:31:17| I'd just like to say I appreciate what you've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9077)|
| 2:31:19| turning to social media to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9079)|
| 2:31:21| folks know what's going on at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9081)|
| 2:31:23| the facilities. I think that's real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9083)|
| 2:31:25| important. You know, we've spent a lot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9085)|
| 2:31:27| in those facilities over the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9087)|
| 2:31:29| four or five years, and I think it's good that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9089)|
| 2:31:31| people see, you know, that there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9091)|
| 2:31:33| action out there because beforehand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| we really didn't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| a whole lot what was going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9097)|
| 2:31:39| So I applaud you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| Well, you know, people do look at Facebook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9101)|
| 2:31:43| and they do look at kids, look at Instagram| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9103)|
| 2:31:45| and those are free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9105)|
| 2:31:47| All you've got to do is make the effort to put up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9107)|
| 2:31:49| information, so we do. We go around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9109)|
| 2:31:51| and take pictures of people that come to our events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9111)|
| 2:31:53| and put them on Facebook and put them on Instagram| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| and it's, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9115)|
| 2:31:57| it's free. It's free advertising for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9117)|
| 2:31:59| and it lets people know. One of the biggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| surprises to me is how much stuff we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9121)|
| 2:32:03| at the Coliseum and at Chilhowee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9123)|
| 2:32:05| Every two or three days there's a dance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9125)|
| 2:32:07| there's a graduation, there's a concert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9127)|
| 2:32:09| there's a football game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9129)|
| 2:32:11| don't forget there's a roller derby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9131)|
| 2:32:13| coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9133)|
| 2:32:15| I was going to get my skates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9135)|
| 2:32:17| out. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9137)|
| 2:32:19| Are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9139)|
| 2:32:21| using and are we getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9141)|
| 2:32:23| help from like Visit Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9143)|
| 2:32:25| and other entities within Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9145)|
| 2:32:27| to help market your stuff so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9147)|
| 2:32:29| we get the word out? I mean, they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9149)|
| 2:32:31| got a website. We have a website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9151)|
| 2:32:33| here at the public assemblies as well, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| they have contacts that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9155)|
| 2:32:37| spread the word through. Are they helping you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9157)|
| 2:32:39| market your facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| They are. We're in touch with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9161)|
| 2:32:43| them. We speak with them often and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9163)|
| 2:32:45| there was a crew that came over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9165)|
| 2:32:47| I want to say last month to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9167)|
| 2:32:49| Coliseum that is doing a video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9169)|
| 2:32:51| that we can put on our website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9171)|
| 2:32:53| and that you can email the people too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9173)|
| 2:32:55| People need to see the facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9175)|
| 2:32:57| and if we get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9177)|
| 2:32:59| request for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9179)|
| 2:33:01| information from somebody, we can just email them a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9181)|
| 2:33:03| 60 second video of what the Coliseum looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9183)|
| 2:33:05| It's something that was done professionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9185)|
| 2:33:07| not something done with an iPhone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9187)|
| 2:33:09| It's going to look good when it's finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9189)|
| 2:33:11| It's a lot better than reading a booklet and you get to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| Exactly. A PDF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| or something. People want to see pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9195)|
| 2:33:17| They want to see something visual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9197)|
| 2:33:19| I think that they're planning one for Chihuahua Park too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9199)|
| 2:33:21| They do help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| People call in with an event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9203)|
| 2:33:25| and I think what they do, I don't want to speak for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9205)|
| 2:33:27| but they try to figure out where to put them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| Some things are best at the Tennessee Theater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9209)|
| 2:33:31| and really there's no better place to do a car show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9211)|
| 2:33:33| or something like that than Chihuahua Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9213)|
| 2:33:35| Yes, to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9215)|
| 2:33:37| they have been a big help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9217)|
| 2:33:39| One other topic is we've got a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9219)|
| 2:33:41| old facilities. Do you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9221)|
| 2:33:43| capital problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9223)|
| 2:33:45| capital improvement needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9225)|
| 2:33:47| going downstream that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9227)|
| 2:33:49| cropping up? Where are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9229)|
| 2:33:51| looking forward in terms of our buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9231)|
| 2:33:53| I know from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| time to time we talk about things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9235)|
| 2:33:57| replacing the pipes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9237)|
| 2:33:59| under an ice skating floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9239)|
| 2:34:01| and all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9241)|
| 2:34:03| Tell us a little bit about what you see as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9243)|
| 2:34:05| capital demands on the system that you run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9245)|
| 2:34:07| Hey, Nick, if I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9247)|
| 2:34:09| direct you to page 13 of 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9249)|
| 2:34:11| Is that the $195,000 you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9251)|
| 2:34:13| $700,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9253)|
| 2:34:15| Page 13 of 14, yeah. And it also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9255)|
| 2:34:17| shows which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9257)|
| 2:34:19| projects have been funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9259)|
| 2:34:21| in 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9261)|
| 2:34:23| 2013. So he's had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| several. And that $700,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| is actually being funded from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| the 503 fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9269)|
| 2:34:31| Right, but those are the numbers. I was wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9271)|
| 2:34:33| if you could tell us a little bit about the facilities and how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9273)|
| 2:34:35| are looking to keep them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9275)|
| 2:34:37| sort of working and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9277)|
| 2:34:39| good to use. Sure. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9279)|
| 2:34:41| And that's something I spend a lot of time thinking about and talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| with people about, too, is the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| of both facilities. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9285)|
| 2:34:47| aging, to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9287)|
| 2:34:49| Aging but beloved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9289)|
| 2:34:51| And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9291)|
| 2:34:53| Coliseum, just to let you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9293)|
| 2:34:55| know, that's for the floor to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9295)|
| 2:34:57| take out the concrete and put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9297)|
| 2:34:59| the pipes in that carry the brine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9299)|
| 2:35:01| that freezes the... It's been talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9301)|
| 2:35:03| for 10 years or more. Yes, and it's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9303)|
| 2:35:05| that the concern, of course, is their original equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9305)|
| 2:35:07| their cast iron that was put in there sometime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9307)|
| 2:35:09| in 1959 or 1960.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9309)|
| 2:35:11| And when they break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9311)|
| 2:35:13| we're in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| So having said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| I want to make sure that you know we won't be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9317)|
| 2:35:19| it this summer. It'll be next summer when we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9319)|
| 2:35:21| We have things booked at the Coliseum this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9321)|
| 2:35:23| And it takes 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9323)|
| 2:35:25| You have to let it cure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9325)|
| 2:35:27| You can't just put... Because the pipes are in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| you've got to let the concrete cure longer than you would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| Because it would stress it to get it cold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9331)|
| 2:35:33| and hot and all that stuff. Apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9333)|
| 2:35:35| To be done correctly, it takes 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9335)|
| 2:35:37| So we're planning that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9337)|
| 2:35:39| for 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9339)|
| 2:35:41| And then that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9341)|
| 2:35:43| that's kind of preventative, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9343)|
| 2:35:45| getting ahead of the curve because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9345)|
| 2:35:47| if it breaks in the middle of the hockey season, then we're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9347)|
| 2:35:49| trouble. Especially the hockey team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9349)|
| 2:35:53| There has been talk, you know, about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9353)|
| 2:35:55| renovating the Coliseum. It is getting older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9355)|
| 2:35:57| It's built in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9357)|
| 2:35:59| 1960, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9359)|
| 2:36:01| It's been maintained very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9361)|
| 2:36:03| I think. A lot of the systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9363)|
| 2:36:05| are new due to the energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9365)|
| 2:36:07| efficiency efforts from the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9367)|
| 2:36:09| few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9369)|
| 2:36:11| But, you know, the bathrooms are older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| Their original equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9373)|
| 2:36:15| The building is very solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9375)|
| 2:36:17| It was built to last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9377)|
| 2:36:19| You might want to look in the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9379)|
| 2:36:21| Now in the next ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9381)|
| 2:36:23| it may be time to put money into the Coliseum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9383)|
| 2:36:25| if you want to continue to have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9385)|
| 2:36:27| size or maybe a little bit bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9387)|
| 2:36:29| of an arena in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9389)|
| 2:36:31| Some engineering group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9391)|
| 2:36:33| looking at that for you in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9393)|
| 2:36:35| No, I think the best way to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9395)|
| 2:36:37| would be sometime in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9397)|
| 2:36:39| to fund a real feasibility study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9399)|
| 2:36:41| about possibly expanding it, upgrading it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9401)|
| 2:36:43| Just see what the market is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9403)|
| 2:36:45| And that's not just something you'd sit around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9405)|
| 2:36:47| and talk. You'd hire a company to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9407)|
| 2:36:49| You know, maybe we could partner with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9409)|
| 2:36:51| or with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9411)|
| 2:36:53| and get some money to look at the feasibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9413)|
| 2:36:55| of doing that. You know, I'm talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9415)|
| 2:36:57| in the future. I don't think this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9417)|
| 2:36:59| that's going to happen in the next... Right, but you don't wait until it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9419)|
| 2:37:01| falls down, so to speak. Exactly. You kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9421)|
| 2:37:03| look forward. You know, because you've got to think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9423)|
| 2:37:05| what are we going to be facing with in the year 2025?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9425)|
| 2:37:07| What's the Coliseum going to look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9427)|
| 2:37:09| What's going to be at Chilhowee Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9429)|
| 2:37:11| And those are both things that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9431)|
| 2:37:13| I spend a lot of time thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9433)|
| 2:37:15| The future at Chilhowee, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9435)|
| 2:37:17| you know, you've got to wonder, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9437)|
| 2:37:19| you know, the venues it holds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9439)|
| 2:37:21| now, you know, are they going to be viable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9441)|
| 2:37:23| 20 years from now? Car shows and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9443)|
| 2:37:25| agricultural fairs, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9445)|
| 2:37:27| And it's a beautiful piece of property, 81 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9447)|
| 2:37:29| the middle of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9449)|
| 2:37:31| If you've never been out there and climbed up that hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9451)|
| 2:37:33| and looked over the lake, it's a fantastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9453)|
| 2:37:35| place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9455)|
| 2:37:37| All right, let's move on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9457)|
| 2:37:39| Mayor Brown. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9459)|
| 2:37:41| Mr. McKay, I want to ask you about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9461)|
| 2:37:43| as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9463)|
| 2:37:45| income or projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9465)|
| 2:37:47| wrestling, professional wrestling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9467)|
| 2:37:49| that used to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9469)|
| 2:37:51| at the Coliseum and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9471)|
| 2:37:53| at Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9473)|
| 2:37:55| Is that something that you've looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9475)|
| 2:37:57| or thought about in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9477)|
| 2:37:59| of bringing that in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9479)|
| 2:38:01| or would that be profitable or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9481)|
| 2:38:03| profitable, or have you thought about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9483)|
| 2:38:05| I have thought about it, talked to several people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9485)|
| 2:38:07| There's a difference of opinion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9487)|
| 2:38:09| Some people kind of think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9489)|
| 2:38:11| trains kind of left the station, as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9491)|
| 2:38:13| wrestling. For a while there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9493)|
| 2:38:15| everybody had wrestling, and now you don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9495)|
| 2:38:17| so much. There is a show planned for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9497)|
| 2:38:19| later this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9499)|
| 2:38:21| Lando, Landau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9501)|
| 2:38:23| Terry, or the other one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9503)|
| 2:38:25| going to do something. Smoke Mountain Wrestling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9505)|
| 2:38:27| I don't know the name of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9507)|
| 2:38:29| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9509)|
| 2:38:31| But they're going to be bringing a show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9511)|
| 2:38:33| so, you know, we're looking at reviving that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9513)|
| 2:38:35| That's a possibility, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9515)|
| 2:38:37| Just wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9517)|
| 2:38:39| about that. I know that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9519)|
| 2:38:41| a big deal in a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9521)|
| 2:38:43| of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9523)|
| 2:38:45| Is Ron and Don Ryan, are they still around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9525)|
| 2:38:47| Wiley Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9527)|
| 2:38:49| I don't know. But we're open to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9529)|
| 2:38:51| any suggestions, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9531)|
| 2:38:53| that you can think of to fill up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9533)|
| 2:38:55| the Jacob Building and to fill up the Homer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9535)|
| 2:38:57| Hamilton, probably the most unused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9537)|
| 2:38:59| venue in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9539)|
| 2:39:01| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9541)|
| 2:39:03| I just wanted to tell exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9543)|
| 2:39:05| what you just said. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9545)|
| 2:39:07| that the Coliseum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9547)|
| 2:39:09| needs a feasibility study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9549)|
| 2:39:11| And I think this is something that you need to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9551)|
| 2:39:13| What are we, where are we going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9553)|
| 2:39:15| We're putting in, and the same with Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9555)|
| 2:39:17| We just spent a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9557)|
| 2:39:19| out there in our last meeting. And what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9559)|
| 2:39:21| the future? What is, what can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9561)|
| 2:39:23| I see, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9563)|
| 2:39:25| you all are putting in the $700,000. That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9565)|
| 2:39:27| But it's not good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9567)|
| 2:39:29| if you're going to, you know, if you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9569)|
| 2:39:31| tear it down, you know. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9571)|
| 2:39:33| that's the thing we need to get with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9573)|
| 2:39:35| And I would encourage you all to just come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9575)|
| 2:39:37| with a feasibility study and make that a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9577)|
| 2:39:39| And also have a vision for the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9579)|
| 2:39:41| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9581)|
| 2:39:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9583)|
| 2:39:47| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9587)|
| 2:39:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9589)|
| 2:39:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9591)|
| 2:39:53| Knoxville Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9593)|
| 2:39:55| Okay, page 28 on the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9595)|
| 2:39:57| Number one in your heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9597)|
| 2:39:59| It also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9599)|
| 2:40:01| goes on page 29 also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9601)|
| 2:40:03| Or you can go to your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9603)|
| 2:40:05| detail pages starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9605)|
| 2:40:07| with 91 through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9607)|

| 2:40:15| Good morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9615)|
| 2:40:17| Council. Mary Bogert with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9617)|
| 2:40:19| Knoxville Convention Center. It is a pleasure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9619)|
| 2:40:21| to be with you this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9621)|
| 2:40:23| to present the Knoxville Convention Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9623)|
| 2:40:25| fiscal budget for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9625)|
| 2:40:27| The story is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9627)|
| 2:40:29| for the most part, actually before I get into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9629)|
| 2:40:31| let me tell you where we are this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9631)|
| 2:40:33| We do plan to make our budget. Right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9633)|
| 2:40:35| we are slotted to be a little ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9635)|
| 2:40:37| of our budget. We've had a very good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9637)|
| 2:40:39| year thus far. April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9639)|
| 2:40:41| as a matter of fact, will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9641)|
| 2:40:43| go down in the history of the busiest month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| in the history of the Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9645)|
| 2:40:47| We did the most food and beverage revenue we've ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9647)|
| 2:40:49| done. So we have certainly been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9649)|
| 2:40:51| very busy. As far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9651)|
| 2:40:53| as the budget request for next fiscal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9653)|
| 2:40:55| year, it is $1,397,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9655)|
| 2:40:57| That's relatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9657)|
| 2:40:59| flat to the current fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9659)|
| 2:41:01| It's about a $27,000 increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9661)|
| 2:41:03| The majority of that is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9663)|
| 2:41:05| increase in utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9665)|
| 2:41:07| The good news is we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9667)|
| 2:41:09| booking more business. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9669)|
| 2:41:11| 208 events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9671)|
| 2:41:13| on the calendar for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9673)|
| 2:41:15| We have 231| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9675)|
| 2:41:17| on the calendar for next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9677)|
| 2:41:19| year. So we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9679)|
| 2:41:21| more business. It's just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9681)|
| 2:41:23| margins of income to the Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9683)|
| 2:41:25| do shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9685)|
| 2:41:27| We're very, very pleased to be able to present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9687)|
| 2:41:29| what we think is very good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| As far as capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9691)|
| 2:41:33| funding requests, we have one request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9693)|
| 2:41:35| It is a $70,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9695)|
| 2:41:37| phone switch. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9697)|
| 2:41:39| phone switch that we currently have at the Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9699)|
| 2:41:41| was the original piece of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9701)|
| 2:41:43| It is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9703)|
| 2:41:45| the backup for the City-County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9705)|
| 2:41:47| building. So that's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9707)|
| 2:41:49| to note. We've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9709)|
| 2:41:51| working with the City IT Department to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9711)|
| 2:41:53| exactly what those needs would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9713)|
| 2:41:55| It is that $70,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9715)|
| 2:41:57| fix. Currently, right now, the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9717)|
| 2:41:59| system works, but if it were to go down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9719)|
| 2:42:01| the technology is no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9721)|
| 2:42:03| supported and it would render the Convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9723)|
| 2:42:05| Center, as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9725)|
| 2:42:07| as being able to have, we could answer the phones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9727)|
| 2:42:09| or we could hang them up, but we would not have voicemail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9729)|
| 2:42:11| the ability to forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9731)|
| 2:42:13| any of those capabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9733)|
| 2:42:15| That is the one capital funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9735)|
| 2:42:17| request that we have for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9737)|
| 2:42:19| Let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9739)|
| 2:42:21| ask you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9741)|
| 2:42:23| I was reading with interest this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9743)|
| 2:42:25| I know the new Convention Center in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9745)|
| 2:42:27| opened and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9747)|
| 2:42:29| I think they had made a commitment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9749)|
| 2:42:31| a million room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9751)|
| 2:42:33| nights and they reached that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9753)|
| 2:42:35| So with that in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9755)|
| 2:42:37| how is that going to, does that really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9757)|
| 2:42:39| affect us here, do you think? I mean, it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9759)|
| 2:42:41| like that's another tier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9761)|
| 2:42:43| It is. It's a different market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9763)|
| 2:42:45| We really don't go after the same types of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9765)|
| 2:42:47| Well, I shouldn't say the same types, the same size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9767)|
| 2:42:49| of business. It really is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9769)|
| 2:42:51| altogether different market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9771)|
| 2:42:53| If anything, it will probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9773)|
| 2:42:55| bring more to the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9775)|
| 2:42:57| So we look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9777)|
| 2:42:59| at it as a positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9779)|
| 2:43:03| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9783)|
| 2:43:05| We'll be bringing more people to the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9785)|
| 2:43:07| that will then perhaps look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9787)|
| 2:43:09| Knoxville. You may not have considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9789)|
| 2:43:11| this region in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9791)|
| 2:43:13| Yeah. Hey, Ms. Broker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9793)|
| 2:43:15| I was wondering, do you see a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| in the marketplace? In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9797)|
| 2:43:19| do gas prices affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9799)|
| 2:43:21| travel so you're having more local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9801)|
| 2:43:23| or regional activity? What's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9803)|
| 2:43:25| happening at your horizon as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9805)|
| 2:43:27| see business shift and change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9807)|
| 2:43:29| with the economy? What's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9809)|
| 2:43:31| Well, the things that we've noticed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9811)|
| 2:43:33| we've actually done very well as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9813)|
| 2:43:35| as convention business. I mean, we haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9815)|
| 2:43:37| lost any business due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9817)|
| 2:43:39| the downturn in the economy over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9819)|
| 2:43:41| three years that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9821)|
| 2:43:43| If anything, what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9823)|
| 2:43:45| come into our market more so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9825)|
| 2:43:47| is the association business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9827)|
| 2:43:49| That's the drivable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9829)|
| 2:43:51| business that comes to the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9831)|
| 2:43:53| So we've done quite well with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9833)|
| 2:43:55| The trends that we've seen in our industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9835)|
| 2:43:57| are more so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9837)|
| 2:43:59| how the meeting planners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9839)|
| 2:44:01| are reacting. They are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9841)|
| 2:44:03| waiting to book the events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9843)|
| 2:44:05| We're seeing less and less of events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9845)|
| 2:44:07| booking three and four...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9847)|
| 2:44:09| Shorter horizons? Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9849)|
| 2:44:11| Shorter horizons between booking...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9851)|
| 2:44:13| Very short-term bookings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9853)|
| 2:44:15| We've actually booked business in the year for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9855)|
| 2:44:17| year on several occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9857)|
| 2:44:19| They're looking for deals? I mean, it's sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9859)|
| 2:44:21| like a price line or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9861)|
| 2:44:23| They are. They know that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9863)|
| 2:44:25| center is going to be much more aggressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9865)|
| 2:44:27| to book that piece of business in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9867)|
| 2:44:29| filler date scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9869)|
| 2:44:31| than they are to sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| on those dates years out. They get better travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9873)|
| 2:44:35| deals, they get better hotel deals, and they get better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| space deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9877)|
| 2:44:39| And so it is a trend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9879)|
| 2:44:41| that we're seeing in our industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9881)|
| 2:44:43| as that booking cycle has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9883)|
| 2:44:45| It makes it more difficult for us to be able to forecast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9885)|
| 2:44:47| going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9887)|
| 2:44:49| To give you an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9889)|
| 2:44:51| this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9891)|
| 2:44:53| I may have mentioned earlier that we're going to make our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| We actually plan to beat our budget this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9895)|
| 2:44:57| We booked two significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9897)|
| 2:44:59| sized pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9899)|
| 2:45:01| of business in the year for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9901)|
| 2:45:03| year. And that's enabled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9903)|
| 2:45:05| us to do that. So it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9905)|
| 2:45:07| becoming much more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9907)|
| 2:45:09| If you take a guess at it, I think I'm going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9909)|
| 2:45:11| $100,000 worth of feed-in or walk-in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9911)|
| 2:45:13| revenue happen in this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9913)|
| 2:45:15| It may not happen that month, but we're seeing it happen in other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9915)|
| 2:45:17| months. So it is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9917)|
| 2:45:19| It's just hard to predict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| Is the downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| improvement process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9923)|
| 2:45:25| helping you to get business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9925)|
| 2:45:27| In other words, you've got something to do here other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9927)|
| 2:45:29| go to your meeting and you want to go noodle around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9929)|
| 2:45:31| the town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9931)|
| 2:45:33| Everything that the city is doing and focused on is helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9933)|
| 2:45:35| our initiatives. It makes it much, much easier to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9935)|
| 2:45:37| get business. It's a beautiful product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9937)|
| 2:45:39| We're certainly very proud of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9939)|
| 2:45:41| What we find is once we get them here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9941)|
| 2:45:43| they don't want to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| And there's something very genuine about the way people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9945)|
| 2:45:47| are treated, the hospitality, but it's actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9947)|
| 2:45:49| beautiful. It's wonderful to go to Market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9949)|
| 2:45:51| Square now. It's wonderful to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9951)|
| 2:45:53| out and be able to enjoy our parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9953)|
| 2:45:55| and everything that we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9955)|
| 2:45:57| with the greenways and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9957)|
| 2:45:59| downtown Knoxville. I'd love to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9959)|
| 2:46:01| the South Waterfront. That would be another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9961)|
| 2:46:03| attraction to sell the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9963)|
| 2:46:05| Is there one that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9965)|
| 2:46:07| South Knoxville is open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9967)|
| 2:46:09| Open for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9969)|
| 2:46:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9971)|
| 2:46:13| Always good to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9973)|

| 2:46:17| Bean counter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| Extraordinaire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9979)|
| 2:46:21| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9981)|
| 2:46:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9983)|
| 2:46:31| I guess that's up to me now, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9991)|
| 2:46:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9993)|
| 2:46:35| So if y'all want to move to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9995)|
| 2:46:37| our budget, you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9997)|
| 2:46:39| go to page 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=9999)|
| 2:46:41| I mean 23 under the detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10001)|
| 2:46:43| tab in the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10003)|
| 2:46:45| Or if you're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10005)|
| 2:46:47| the handout, it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10007)|
| 2:46:49| page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10009)|
| 2:46:51| 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10011)|
| 2:46:55| It's, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10015)|
| 2:46:57| a flat budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10017)|
| 2:46:59| We did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10019)|
| 2:47:01| realize a reduction in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10021)|
| 2:47:03| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10023)|
| 2:47:05| external financial statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10025)|
| 2:47:07| of the audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10027)|
| 2:47:09| team. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10029)|
| 2:47:11| We put the bid out for the external| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10031)|
| 2:47:13| audit this year and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10033)|
| 2:47:15| have a new contract with new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10035)|
| 2:47:17| auditors and that bid came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10037)|
| 2:47:19| in very reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10039)|
| 2:47:21| so it's a reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10041)|
| 2:47:23| of $22,000 from last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10043)|
| 2:47:25| and here are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10045)|
| 2:47:27| line items that make up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10047)|
| 2:47:29| the total before 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10049)|
| 2:47:31| The only other change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10051)|
| 2:47:33| that I see is we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10053)|
| 2:47:35| we opted out last year of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| National League of Cities. It's listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10057)|
| 2:47:39| but we don't we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10059)|
| 2:47:41| You need to mark that out and I need to mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10061)|
| 2:47:43| that out in the future until we decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10063)|
| 2:47:45| we're going to start paying those dues again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10065)|
| 2:47:47| How much are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10067)|
| 2:47:49| How much were those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10069)|
| 2:47:51| before Cindy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10071)|
| 2:47:55| It was $11,000, right at $11,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10075)|
| 2:47:57| I never figured out what we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10077)|
| 2:47:59| from them. I couldn't either and that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10079)|
| 2:48:01| I took it out, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| So if you'll just mark through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10083)|
| 2:48:05| line and then in preparation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10085)|
| 2:48:07| do you all have any other questions about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10087)|

| 2:48:11| I don't have a question. I just throw it out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10091)|
| 2:48:13| for we've got a few minutes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10093)|
| 2:48:15| discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10095)|
| 2:48:17| You know, me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10097)|
| 2:48:19| personally, I don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10099)|
| 2:48:21| I don't I could get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10101)|
| 2:48:23| belabor the point or I could get in a philosophical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10103)|
| 2:48:25| discussion about 202 funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10105)|
| 2:48:27| That's part of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10107)|
| 2:48:29| I don't really see, personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10109)|
| 2:48:31| I don't see the need in continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10111)|
| 2:48:33| that program and, you know, throw it out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10113)|
| 2:48:35| for discussion. It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10115)|
| 2:48:37| $10,000 a piece. It's $90,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10117)|
| 2:48:39| a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10119)|
| 2:48:41| We spend a lot of time managing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10121)|
| 2:48:43| Melissa does and managing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10123)|
| 2:48:45| our accounts and a few dollars here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10125)|
| 2:48:47| and a few dollars there. I think you ought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10127)|
| 2:48:49| to debate whether that's something you want to keep in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10129)|
| 2:48:51| or not. Just throw it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10131)|
| 2:48:53| Well, I can give you a little history on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10133)|
| 2:48:55| I mean, back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10135)|
| 2:48:57| when I was on council the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10137)|
| 2:48:59| it was $40,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10139)|
| 2:49:01| per council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10141)|
| 2:49:03| and then we did away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10143)|
| 2:49:05| with it. I think the last year I was on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10145)|
| 2:49:07| council we voted it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10147)|
| 2:49:09| and then one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10149)|
| 2:49:11| and then the next council brought it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10151)|
| 2:49:13| at the $10,000 level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10153)|
| 2:49:15| So there's been fluctuation and change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10155)|
| 2:49:17| in that. I just throw that out just as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10157)|
| 2:49:19| historical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10159)|
| 2:49:21| whatever historical value that brings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10161)|
| 2:49:23| to council. No, I was just going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10163)|
| 2:49:25| George, I respect that. I mean, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10165)|
| 2:49:27| hold the line and don't spend any of that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10167)|
| 2:49:29| in whatever you end up doing with it. I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10169)|
| 2:49:31| turning it back into community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10171)|
| 2:49:33| but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10173)|
| 2:49:35| there's a lot of organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10175)|
| 2:49:37| within our districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10177)|
| 2:49:39| you know, we kind of have a fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10179)|
| 2:49:41| tuned feel of who needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10181)|
| 2:49:43| what and we, you know, all those organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10183)|
| 2:49:45| to get requests from us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10185)|
| 2:49:47| sure it's discretionary. We have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10187)|
| 2:49:49| opportunity to make a decision on who we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10189)|
| 2:49:51| but, you know, for example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10191)|
| 2:49:53| like the Cerebral Palsy organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10193)|
| 2:49:55| lost huge funding this past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10195)|
| 2:49:57| and I felt in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10197)|
| 2:49:59| district that was someone very worthy of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10199)|
| 2:50:01| getting a little bit of money. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10201)|
| 2:50:03| see your fiscal responsibility side of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10203)|
| 2:50:05| but I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10205)|
| 2:50:07| you know, it does a lot of good. That little bit of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10207)|
| 2:50:09| can help certain groups go far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10209)|
| 2:50:11| Councilman DelVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10211)|
| 2:50:13| I was going to agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10213)|
| 2:50:15| with Councilman Campin in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10215)|
| 2:50:17| sense that you find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10217)|
| 2:50:19| needs in some of these districts that don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10219)|
| 2:50:21| another place to turn to but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10221)|
| 2:50:23| I think George has one point that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10223)|
| 2:50:25| really should look at. There ought to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10225)|
| 2:50:27| a better way to dispense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10227)|
| 2:50:29| these funds. Maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10229)|
| 2:50:31| we're a victim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10231)|
| 2:50:33| of state law and what not but it puts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10233)|
| 2:50:35| a fair amount of administrative burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10235)|
| 2:50:37| on Melissa and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10237)|
| 2:50:39| you know, you're given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10239)|
| 2:50:41| $500 for a park to buy a bench| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10241)|
| 2:50:43| it shouldn't take, you know, a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10243)|
| 2:50:45| hours effort but we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10245)|
| 2:50:47| ask the group to submit a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10247)|
| 2:50:49| paperwork and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10249)|
| 2:50:51| what, certifications that they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10251)|
| 2:50:53| got the right status. I know that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10253)|
| 2:50:55| important under state law but the amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10255)|
| 2:50:57| money doesn't justify the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10257)|
| 2:50:59| and if there was a way to simplify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10259)|
| 2:51:01| I don't know how we do that. Maybe we ask our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10261)|
| 2:51:03| lawyers or someone if there's any way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10263)|
| 2:51:05| Or maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10265)|
| 2:51:07| there ought to be, or maybe $10,000 is not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10267)|
| 2:51:09| Maybe you say, gosh, if we had $40,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10269)|
| 2:51:11| that's what I need. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10271)|
| 2:51:13| but it's very discretionary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10273)|
| 2:51:15| and you're doing, some of these are $100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10275)|
| 2:51:17| I mean, you know, it's quite a bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10277)|
| 2:51:19| I don't know. We could maybe come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10279)|
| 2:51:21| with some rules. I know when it was $40,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10281)|
| 2:51:23| I think we held it around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10283)|
| 2:51:25| a $500 minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10285)|
| 2:51:27| No? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10287)|
| 2:51:29| We never had a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10289)|
| 2:51:31| Is there no way to get a dispensing authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10291)|
| 2:51:33| that, in other words, once it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10293)|
| 2:51:35| approved that someone manages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10295)|
| 2:51:37| it differently or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10297)|
| 2:51:39| is it faulty to turn it over? Well, you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10299)|
| 2:51:41| draft the ordinance to appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10301)|
| 2:51:43| the money to requisition it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10303)|
| 2:51:45| to have an authorization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10305)|
| 2:51:47| to requisition it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10307)|
| 2:51:49| Now, once you all make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10309)|
| 2:51:51| donation to a certain organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10311)|
| 2:51:53| within a fiscal year and I have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10313)|
| 2:51:55| paperwork on file, the next time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10315)|
| 2:51:57| someone asks me to do something for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10317)|
| 2:51:59| then all I have to do is get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10319)|
| 2:52:01| So once they qualify that you can just get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10321)|
| 2:52:03| the update. Right. And then the next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10323)|
| 2:52:05| I have to check the file to make sure that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10325)|
| 2:52:07| the audited financial statements. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10327)|
| 2:52:09| ever have to go back again and get the 501C3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10329)|
| 2:52:11| or C6, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10331)|
| 2:52:13| the IRS designation letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10333)|
| 2:52:15| But it's just making sure that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10335)|
| 2:52:17| have the financials annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10337)|
| 2:52:19| and checking the file on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10339)|
| 2:52:21| and drafting the ordinance and then requisitioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10341)|
| 2:52:23| it through finance. It's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10343)|
| 2:52:25| time consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10345)|
| 2:52:27| Plus, a lot of you wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10347)|
| 2:52:29| and want me to call and get letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10349)|
| 2:52:31| and things like that. So, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10351)|
| 2:52:33| could do it prior to budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10353)|
| 2:52:35| that would be helpful. Well, there's no shame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10355)|
| 2:52:37| I guess in turning money back in if you haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10357)|
| 2:52:39| spent it. Well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10359)|
| 2:52:41| Finance always loves to have money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10361)|
| 2:52:45| We'll be happy to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10365)|
| 2:52:49| Well, I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10369)|
| 2:52:51| given this a lot of thought over the four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10371)|
| 2:52:53| years and when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10373)|
| 2:52:55| someone wants $100, I'm not really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10375)|
| 2:52:57| sure that they're going to do a whole lot with $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10377)|
| 2:52:59| After the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10379)|
| 2:53:01| first year of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10381)|
| 2:53:03| really wrestling with some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10383)|
| 2:53:05| requests, I finally decided that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10385)|
| 2:53:07| it would have to be something for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10387)|
| 2:53:09| a capital project or a startup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10389)|
| 2:53:11| or a one-time expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10391)|
| 2:53:13| for the organization, but nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10393)|
| 2:53:15| related to operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10395)|
| 2:53:17| expenses because year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10397)|
| 2:53:19| after year, some organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10399)|
| 2:53:21| request money which actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10401)|
| 2:53:23| turns out to be operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10403)|
| 2:53:25| Dependency, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10405)|
| 2:53:27| Yeah, it becomes a dependency and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10407)|
| 2:53:29| not something that I think is healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10409)|
| 2:53:31| for that organization because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10411)|
| 2:53:33| next person who sits on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10413)|
| 2:53:35| council may not be interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10415)|
| 2:53:37| in that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10417)|
| 2:53:39| I don't think $10,000 is enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10419)|
| 2:53:41| for us to be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10421)|
| 2:53:43| At the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10423)|
| 2:53:47| this is a real wrestling thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10427)|
| 2:53:49| This year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10429)|
| 2:53:51| I tried to get most of my money spent by December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10431)|
| 2:53:53| and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10433)|
| 2:53:55| assuming that we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10435)|
| 2:53:57| the money for the next coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10437)|
| 2:53:59| Virtually all my money is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10439)|
| 2:54:01| to one particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10441)|
| 2:54:03| organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10443)|
| 2:54:05| for helping their startup costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10445)|
| 2:54:07| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10447)|
| 2:54:09| probably as a council, we don't all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10449)|
| 2:54:11| the same idea about how we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10451)|
| 2:54:13| to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10453)|
| 2:54:15| to the requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10455)|
| 2:54:17| I know some organizations, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10457)|
| 2:54:19| are very offended because they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10459)|
| 2:54:21| get money, and at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10461)|
| 2:54:23| same time, others turn cartwheels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10463)|
| 2:54:25| The fact that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10465)|
| 2:54:27| a number of organizations that are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10467)|
| 2:54:29| 501C3s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10469)|
| 2:54:31| then they have to find a fiscal agent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10471)|
| 2:54:33| to do that. Yeah, that's the hard part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10473)|
| 2:54:35| the logistics. And, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10475)|
| 2:54:37| if I was an organization with a 501C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10477)|
| 2:54:39| I would run the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10479)|
| 2:54:41| way as quickly as I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10481)|
| 2:54:43| simply because they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10483)|
| 2:54:45| strict accounting measures for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10485)|
| 2:54:47| how monies they receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10487)|
| 2:54:49| are dispersed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10489)|
| 2:54:51| And some of the people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10491)|
| 2:54:53| don't have 501C3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10493)|
| 2:54:55| don't want to be bothered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10495)|
| 2:54:57| with those accounting practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10497)|
| 2:54:59| receipts, and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10499)|
| 2:55:01| And so that also becomes an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| It's a hot potato, and, George,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10503)|
| 2:55:05| I really appreciate your bringing this up because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10505)|
| 2:55:07| there are some times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10507)|
| 2:55:09| when I think, oh, if we just didn't have this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10509)|
| 2:55:11| it would be so much easier to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10511)|
| 2:55:13| And then other times, I feel like, well, I can really make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10513)|
| 2:55:15| difference here, so there's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10515)|
| 2:55:17| an easy answer. And let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10517)|
| 2:55:19| say one thing about a startup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10519)|
| 2:55:21| organization. The state says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10521)|
| 2:55:23| that the entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10523)|
| 2:55:25| has to have been in business for a full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10525)|
| 2:55:27| year and have an audited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10527)|
| 2:55:29| financial statement available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10529)|
| 2:55:31| and provide that prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10531)|
| 2:55:33| any funds going to them. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10533)|
| 2:55:35| if you're helping somebody get, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10535)|
| 2:55:37| have helped a lot of these non-profits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10537)|
| 2:55:39| get started, but we had to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10539)|
| 2:55:41| through a fiscal agent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10541)|
| 2:55:43| in order to get them started because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10543)|
| 2:55:45| they didn't qualify for the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10545)|
| 2:55:47| So there's lots of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10547)|
| 2:55:49| each one of them, you have to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10549)|
| 2:55:51| the situation. Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10551)|
| 2:55:53| are easy to do. The libraries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10553)|
| 2:55:55| are easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| Those entities that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10557)|
| 2:55:59| routinely given money to, just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10559)|
| 2:56:01| in the mayor's community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10561)|
| 2:56:03| and agency grants, it's the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10563)|
| 2:56:05| organizations each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10565)|
| 2:56:07| Those are fairly easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10567)|
| 2:56:09| But then when you get new entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10569)|
| 2:56:11| then you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10571)|
| 2:56:13| explain this to them, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10573)|
| 2:56:15| they don't understand sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10575)|
| 2:56:17| That's where the burden comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10577)|
| 2:56:19| of educating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10579)|
| 2:56:21| But, I mean, it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10581)|
| 2:56:23| Whatever you all decide to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10583)|
| 2:56:25| is what I'll work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10585)|
| 2:56:29| Well, the other side of the coin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10589)|
| 2:56:31| is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10591)|
| 2:56:33| we don't have any follow-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10593)|
| 2:56:35| to know really how people have actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10595)|
| 2:56:37| spent the money, and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10597)|
| 2:56:39| they have in fact spent it for what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10599)|
| 2:56:41| responded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10601)|
| 2:56:43| and that's always been a bit of a disturbing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10603)|
| 2:56:45| thing, but I don't want to have one more piece of paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10605)|
| 2:56:47| that has to come in. Well, what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10607)|
| 2:56:49| is those entities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10609)|
| 2:56:51| required. That's why I have to ask for their audited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10611)|
| 2:56:53| financial statements. What I get are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10613)|
| 2:56:55| confirmation letters. I'll get a confirmation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10615)|
| 2:56:57| letter from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10617)|
| 2:56:59| Second Harvest Food Bank saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10619)|
| 2:57:01| did you make a donation to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10621)|
| 2:57:03| What was it designated for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10623)|
| 2:57:05| So there is a checks and balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10625)|
| 2:57:07| on their end that I answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10627)|
| 2:57:09| those audit confirmations. That's another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10629)|
| 2:57:11| function that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10631)|
| 2:57:13| Again, that's one more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10633)|
| 2:57:15| piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10635)|
| 2:57:17| the workload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10637)|
| 2:57:19| Right. That's related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10639)|
| 2:57:21| to 202s, yeah. And on the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10641)|
| 2:57:23| I assume they get that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10643)|
| 2:57:25| finance also. Yeah, Jim is shaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10645)|
| 2:57:27| his head yes. I assume they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10647)|
| 2:57:29| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10649)|
| 2:57:31| I was just wondering, so the community action grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10651)|
| 2:57:33| through the mayor's office, they have to go through the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10653)|
| 2:57:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10655)|
| 2:57:37| Somebody handles those, but they pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10657)|
| 2:57:39| them, what do you do most of yours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10659)|
| 2:57:41| quarterly, those? If it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10661)|
| 2:57:43| under, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10663)|
| 2:57:45| $5,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10665)|
| 2:57:47| then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10667)|
| 2:57:49| will take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10669)|
| 2:57:51| at it and see whether we pay it once at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| either one time payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| or not. Anything over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10675)|
| 2:57:57| $5,000, we pay quarterly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10677)|
| 2:57:59| allotments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10679)|
| 2:58:01| Yeah, well, Brenda brought up a good point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10681)|
| 2:58:03| that I wondered about because I did go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10683)|
| 2:58:05| and check on some of the folks that I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10685)|
| 2:58:07| given money to and found out that the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10687)|
| 2:58:09| that it was given money for was not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10689)|
| 2:58:11| And so I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10691)|
| 2:58:13| that is a problem, Brenda, in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10693)|
| 2:58:15| what it is. And I also agree that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10695)|
| 2:58:17| $100 here, $100 there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10697)|
| 2:58:19| in a lot of cases, does help some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10699)|
| 2:58:21| neighborhood organizations, but they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10701)|
| 2:58:23| become dependent on it. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10703)|
| 2:58:25| frankly, it's a hassle for us, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10705)|
| 2:58:27| as well as for Melissa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10707)|
| 2:58:29| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10709)|
| 2:58:31| I just wanted to say I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10711)|
| 2:58:33| usually a good thing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10713)|
| 2:58:35| these small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10715)|
| 2:58:37| community and neighborhood organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10717)|
| 2:58:39| I usually try to go about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10719)|
| 2:58:41| a hundred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10721)|
| 2:58:43| sometimes less, sometimes more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10723)|
| 2:58:45| But in the overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10725)|
| 2:58:47| scheme of things, I think it's good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10727)|
| 2:58:49| for these neighborhood organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10729)|
| 2:58:51| And I wanted to ask you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10731)|
| 2:58:53| Vice Mayor, you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10733)|
| 2:58:55| did this start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10735)|
| 2:58:57| prior to your time on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10737)|
| 2:58:59| council? How long have we actually been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10739)|
| 2:59:01| this or the council been doing it? Who knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10741)|
| 2:59:03| that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10743)|
| 2:59:05| Before it was a community improvement fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10745)|
| 2:59:07| it used to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10747)|
| 2:59:09| and the council would receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10749)|
| 2:59:11| monies as surplus property was sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10751)|
| 2:59:13| and it would be divvied out between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10753)|
| 2:59:15| the six council districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10755)|
| 2:59:17| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10757)|
| 2:59:19| when I came in 1988,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10759)|
| 2:59:21| that's what they had. They would sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10761)|
| 2:59:23| a piece of property, that money would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10763)|
| 2:59:25| into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10765)|
| 2:59:27| what was it called? There was a fund number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10767)|
| 2:59:29| for it, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10769)|
| 2:59:31| 501.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10771)|
| 2:59:33| 501, surplus property fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10773)|
| 2:59:35| And then council would decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10775)|
| 2:59:37| And that was even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10777)|
| 2:59:39| you know, you'd get sporadic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10779)|
| 2:59:41| money deposited there and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10781)|
| 2:59:43| at-large council members didn't even have any funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10783)|
| 2:59:45| back then. Now we could go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10785)|
| 2:59:47| back to that. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10787)|
| 2:59:49| I'll go back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10789)|
| 2:59:51| I'm already there. Let's sell the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10791)|
| 2:59:53| and kind of divvy it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10793)|
| 2:59:55| Hold on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10795)|
| 2:59:57| Councilman. I'm going to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10797)|
