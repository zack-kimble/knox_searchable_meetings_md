| 0:04:11| Councilman Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| I would like to postpone items 12B and 12C until our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| I would like to postpone items 12B and 12C until our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=266)|
| 0:04:33| Can we do them in combination, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| Or Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| You can do them both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| So, Mr. Roberto, you're making a motion to postpone for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| items 12B and 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| 12B and 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| And, Mayor, before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| I'm going to take a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| Before we vote, Mayor, if I could have just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| I wanted to talk a little bit about how we got to where we are and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| then discuss this with Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| Well, are you talking, I mean, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| Do you want to talk about this in the course of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| I'm just talking about how we got here and the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| And then I had a good conversation with Deputy Mayor Aaron Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| and Director Brooks and just wanted to go over those because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| the items here that we're postponing for two weeks, it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| to be specific about why we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| So if I could have a little bit of leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| So, obviously, in what's coming up, you'll see that we have two items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| on the agenda in 12B and 12C that are different versions of a signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=354)|
| 0:06:03| standard in the institutional district through an ordinance amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| What brought us here is that in September of 2019, we had a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| by council to ask for appropriate signed standards and review of signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| standards in the institutional district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| Then, having no proposal, council moved to have a 120-day moratorium on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| signs in the institutional district in December of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| Then that moratorium was then renewed to another moratorium in April of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=394)|
| 0:06:42| 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Again, no proposal to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| Then we had a workshop July 9th in which council asked for additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| And three months later, we have the proposal that is contained in 12B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| that council then received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| Council, as I understand it, would like to see comprehensive signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=422)|
| 0:07:09| standards in the institutional district based on all of that activity that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| has gone on over the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| And what I wanted to make sure of is before we vote to postpone, to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| And I know you and I had spoke earlier about that in two weeks, you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| provide us a roadmap, basically, for how you're going to get us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| stand-alone comprehensive signed standards in the institutional district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| Good evening, Councilmembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| This is Amy Brooks, Knoxville Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| Yes, Councilmember Roberto, planning would welcome the opportunity to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| time to review our work program in consultation with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| administration to identify that realistic timeline and process and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| resources necessary for developing signed standards, specifically for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| institutional district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| And when we're talking about signed standards, we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| the actual process of getting us to stand-alone comprehensive signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| standards in the institutional district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=493)|

| 0:08:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| I apologize for taking up that much time early in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| But just wanted to make sure everyone was clear on what we were voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| So the motion on the floor is to postpone for two weeks items 12B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| and 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| Does anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| I just wanted to provide a roadmap for these standards in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| But we won't necessarily be able to vote on these items in two weeks if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| just the roadmap is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| Am I missing something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| Maybe we could just see what happens in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| And if she's ready to provide a substantive plan at that time, you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| And if not, then it can be postponed another two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| Ms. Brooks, did you want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| You know, what I think is realistic for us to be able to provide in two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| weeks is a timeline for updating or developing the signed standards and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| giving you just some more information about how long it will take, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| the process will look like, and any sort of resources that we might need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| to undertake that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| I don't anticipate that we would be able to bring back draft signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| standards at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| Yeah, just following up on Councilperson Smith's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| I think what we're doing is giving planning staff some time to develop a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=582)|
| 0:09:50| roadmap to get us to where we want it to go with a comprehensive set of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| signed standards in the institutional district that are standalone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| And so we're giving them two weeks to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| And both items are still available, as the mayor said, in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| So if we're not happy with that, then obviously we can vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| But this does give some time for that review and that roadmap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Any further discussions on the motion to postpone items 12B and 12C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=617)|

| 0:11:41| an imperfect system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=701)|

| 0:13:01| to protect the public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=781)|

| 0:13:11| voting is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=791)|

| 0:13:38| And that's in part because of COVID-19 protocols and also new voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| If you're planning on strategically picking a polling location, voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| is heaviest in Farragut and downtown west or New Harvest and especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| in the mornings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| If you want to avoid a longer wait, you might consider voting later in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| the day when lines are typically shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=836)|

| 0:27:46| include more access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| jobs, housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1668)|

| 0:27:54| and we don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| about it, but it not only affects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| people with disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1678)|

| 0:28:02| The more access they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| there's more curb cutouts to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| off of public transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1686)|

| 0:28:10| how far is it to a curb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| cutout. Ten years ago, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1692)|

| 0:28:16| and I have to be honest, I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| give much thought to the cutouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1698)|

| 0:28:24| sister said something profound real early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| in my injury, she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| until Joel's injury, she never noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| so many people in a wheelchair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1710)|

| 0:28:34| to be a part of a city that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| this forward-thinking to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| this much access, and I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| it'll come to us as far as tourism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| It's just a fantastic program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| and like I said, the Mayor's Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| that pretty much took up all of our meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1728)|

| 0:29:12| afterthought if we had it at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| but it shows an increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| level of awareness in our city about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1756)|

| 0:29:20| and pedestrian access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| and maybe a little bit less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| car-centric culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1764)|

| 0:29:44| for Mr. Johnson or the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| Are we opposed, or is there a reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| if people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=1788)|

| 0:44:54| and the plan has been updated over the years as the park has grown, as usage has grown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2694)|
| 0:45:01| and as new and different user groups have come to the park. The most recent plan was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| adopted in 2014. I went back and watched the video of that, and I note that at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2708)|
| 0:45:16| of that public meeting in December of 2013, the master plan process was explained, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2716)|
| 0:45:24| it was that the master plan is the guide for future development of the park. And the master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2724)|

| 0:45:59| After the exponential growth in usage of the park over the last few years, we've had more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| visitors, we think, in 2020 than we've ever had before. The families visiting, trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2766)|
| 0:46:15| to get out of the house without being too close to other people, has really expanded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| park usage, and we've learned a lot about what families want to see at the park during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| that process. In 2017, we engaged Nelson Byrd Woltz, a landscape architect based in Charlottesville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2787)|
| 0:46:36| Virginia, to update the master plan based on the full 185 acres and based upon the growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2796)|
| 0:46:44| usage of the park and different uses people are seeking. Nelson Byrd Woltz spent two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2804)|
| 0:46:51| studying the park, analyzing usage of the park, studying the Ross Tower master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| and expanding on the concepts in that plan, and developed a new plan that was presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2818)|
| 0:47:07| in June of this year. It was posted on the conservancy website, and overall, during that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2827)|
| 0:47:18| period, received more than 10,000 views as the process went forward. When the plan was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2838)|
| 0:47:26| posted, we began a publicity campaign and had support of local media. There was a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2846)|
| 0:47:34| article on the first page of the New Sentinel. Several television stations carried it. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| was promoted on social media and through signage at the park, and we had robust participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2859)|
| 0:47:46| in the public input survey. There were approximately 670 people who responded to the survey, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2866)|
| 0:47:53| more than 500 of them opened extensive open-ended questions that really gave us guidance about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2873)|
| 0:48:04| the future of the park. So having said that, the results of that public input process and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2884)|
| 0:48:11| results of two public meetings, a live public meeting held at the park and a Zoom public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=2891)|

| 0:58:12| it's headed. I also really like how the most recent survey has been handled. I feel like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3492)|
| 0:58:21| Lakeshore Conservancy and its consultants took the survey results very seriously. I watched the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3501)|
| 0:58:29| webinar this September and I was struck by how carefully they explained problems like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3509)|
| 0:58:36| difficulty of having river access from the park. They also address concerns as you've heard about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3516)|
| 0:58:43| lighting and about noise. But most of all, I was impressed with their positive response to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3523)|
| 0:58:49| suggestions for future improvements. So what I basically I love Lakeshore Park, and I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3529)|
| 0:58:58| new master plan will make it even better. And particularly with more recreational possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3538)|
| 0:59:05| for a wider range of people. So that's why I support the park. But I also wanted to tag on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| to this by saying that I'm the president of the Ferdinand Village Council. The council has about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3551)|
| 0:59:21| 20 members. Those members represent neighborhoods and businesses in the eastern part of Bearden that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3561)|
| 0:59:29| stretches from North Shore down Kingston Pike and Lyons View and Sutherland towards town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3569)|
| 0:59:37| And the members of the council have voted unanimously in support of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3577)|
| 0:59:44| We hope that you all will too. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| Thank you so much, Ms. English. Next person signed up to speak in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| opposition is Scott Smith. Mr. Smith, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3594)|
| 1:00:07| Scott Smith signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3607)|
| 1:00:14| Ma'am, he's I think he's unmuted himself now. Can you hear me? Yes. A little bit of an echo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3614)|
| 1:00:23| but that's okay. Go ahead. You have up to five minutes. Please start by stating your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| name and address for the record. He's having some issues, but I think he's rejoined us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3628)|
| 1:00:40| Okay. Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3640)|
| 1:00:47| Mr. Smith, you need to unmute yourself. There you are, I think. Mr. Smith, can you hear us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3647)|
| 1:00:59| He had called me during an earlier portion of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| stating he was having difficulties hearing us. Okay. I suggest that he attempt to phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3663)|
| 1:01:10| one of the numbers on the invitation. There's one other person signed up to speak. We could go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| him and come back to Mr. Smith. Is Mr. Benjamin Mullins, is he on the call? Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3676)|
| 1:01:24| Okay. Mr. Mullins, can you hear us and can you speak so we can hear you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3684)|
| 1:01:30| Yes, Ben Mullins, 550 West Spain Street. Okay. You have up to five minutes to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3690)|
| 1:01:37| your thoughts with City Council. Thank you, and I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| I'm not usually before City Council in the role of being opposed to a plan like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3701)|
| 1:01:51| I've had a chance to look at it in quite a bit of detail, and there's several elements of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| that we, that my clients believe are very beneficial. I've been retained on behalf of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| some residents in some adjacent neighborhoods of Westminster, West Chase, and Westminster on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3723)|
| 1:02:10| the Creek. And they wanted to, me to articulate some of the concerns they have with the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3730)|
| 1:02:17| and particularly the event center and the band shell that is taking the place of where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3737)|
| 1:02:27| current baseball fields are. And there's some concern about the sound from live music that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3747)|
| 1:02:35| will be generated from that location. Back in June, there was a rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3755)|
| 1:02:44| for the Villa Colina property at 5628 Lions View Pike. That is about 1,000 feet north of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3764)|
| 1:02:52| Lakeshore Park. There was a significant opposition. The Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| unanimously voted to not recommend that rezoning. One of the issues raised by many of the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3778)|
| 1:03:08| including Mr. Cesar Stairs, who was on the board for the Conservancy, one of the issues the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| neighbors raised was concerns about the noise generated from Mr. Barton's live music events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3793)|
| 1:03:20| that he would hold for nonprofit fundraisers there, and the potential expansion of that use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3800)|
| 1:03:26| to where there would be potentially more live music events. Many of them talked about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3806)|
| 1:03:32| rebounding sound of the live music off of the Tennessee River and how that had an amplification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3812)|
| 1:03:39| effect of the sound. And that is one of the concerns that we have here is that we're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3819)|
| 1:03:49| dealing with live music events, probably more so than before. In fact, Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3829)|
| 1:03:58| who lives south of Lakeshore Park, almost one mile from Villa Colina, testified or spoke at during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3838)|
| 1:04:05| the agenda review of the Planning Commission meeting saying he could hear audibly the music| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| from the Villa Colina's events. Now, the band shell at Lakeshore Park is going to be even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3850)|
| 1:04:19| closer. Now, Mr. Smith's complaints, and he can address them in a second if he can get on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3859)|
| 1:04:27| that is really from the relocation of the ball fields closer to his residence and the light that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3867)|
| 1:04:34| will create. I understand there was some representations in 2013 that the ball field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3874)|
| 1:04:41| location, which are soccer fields right now, would not be lit. The impetus for moving the ball fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| from its current location appears to be the creation of this event center and band shell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| As late as September of 2019, there was a music, a new groove, new ground, excuse me, music festival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3893)|
| 1:05:01| held at the park with events going to, you know, music lasting until 9 p.m. And clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3901)|
| 1:05:08| having a larger event venue area can only be a harbinger of frequent and probably more intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3908)|
| 1:05:14| live music. And so, there's lots of concerns about that. Because of this, my clients and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3914)|
| 1:05:22| think that maybe we should pause and reconsider the plan, at least some elements of the plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| would increase the live music events that could take place there. Another concern that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3929)|
| 1:05:37| I have one minute here I need to address is the consolidation of the sports fields at the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3937)|
| 1:05:43| side of Lakeshore Park would concentrate the traffic that would be entering and exiting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3943)|
| 1:05:51| park for those events at the South North Shore Drive. And we're concerned there hasn't been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| traffic study on the potential impact of the traffic in that area. And we would ask that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3957)|
| 1:06:04| maybe that needs to be studied a little bit more before council votes on this plan. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3964)|
| 1:06:12| in sum, we really like a lot of the plan and we love Lakeshore Park, but we think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3972)|
| 1:06:19| some parts of this plan that may be too intense for this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| and we would like that to be studied a little bit more. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3983)|
| 1:06:32| Thank you, Mr. Mullins. Has Scott Smith been able to access the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3992)|
| 1:06:38| I see he's listed here twice. I'm going to allow him to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| Okay. Mr. Smith, can you hear us? Yes. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4002)|
| 1:06:47| We sure can. Go ahead. You have five minutes. I'm really sorry about that. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| My name is Scott Smith. I live at 1476 Lyons Bend Road. And I hate being categorized as being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4013)|
| 1:07:04| in opposition to the park. I'm truly supportive of the park. I love Lakeshore. I've lived in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| house for 30 years. I'm over there three days a week and I coached baseball there for six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4029)|
| 1:07:16| I coached many sports for KYS and really enjoyed it. So, please don't take this as in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4036)|
| 1:07:23| negative towards the park because I support it. Also, respect and support the foundation that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| done such good work over there. My concern is just, you know, from a personal standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4049)|
| 1:07:37| the lighting is 700 feet from my bedroom. And, you know, I went to a lot of those public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| and I felt like I had a commitment from Parks and Rec and also from the Lakeshore group that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4063)|
| 1:07:50| you know, those fields were not going to be lit. I don't have a problem with the fields. I knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| they were going to put fields there. But things apparently have changed and that commitment is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4075)|
| 1:08:02| no longer on the table. So, obviously, you know, if that's going to have to be the case, I prefer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4082)|
| 1:08:08| that wasn't the case. I'm not sure I really understand the need to tear down six baseball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| fields and rebuild four across the park. And, you know, there's extensive clearing and grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4094)|
| 1:08:20| that'll have to take place there. Several, I mean, 13, I would count, really nice mature trees that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4100)|
| 1:08:28| I had anticipated would stay that are going to be gone. And I think that, you know, that's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4108)|
| 1:08:36| kind of a shame. But nevertheless, I'm just one person. So, I'll support whatever ends up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4116)|
| 1:08:43| happening. The lighting that they are touting is very good lighting. There's no question. I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4123)|
| 1:08:51| it's state of the art. The problem, as I read through that report, though, was that that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4131)|
| 1:08:58| is really elevated. It's about 20 feet higher than my house. And it's pretty much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4138)|
| 1:09:07| even with the folks across the street from me in Westminster, I've heard from quite a few of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4147)|
| 1:09:12| people that I stayed in touch with, and they were not very happy about this, moving to putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4152)|
| 1:09:19| everything right there in that corner. Additionally, there's a parking lot that's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| be put there that will be lit as well. And, you know, that we don't have any commitments about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4163)|
| 1:09:30| hours, how many nights a week. We've asked for some sort of guidance where, you know, are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4170)|
| 1:09:38| going to close? Are these games going to go on past nine o'clock? Are concerts going to be once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4178)|
| 1:09:45| a month? Are concerts, we have, I think there's two concert venues in there. And, you know, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4185)|
| 1:09:52| just like some assurances as residents who live, you know, right next to the park. I mean, we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| it all the time. And it's wonderful in those aspects. But, you know, there's some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4198)|
| 1:10:04| that are proposed here that could dramatically change our quality of life in terms of how often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4204)|
| 1:10:10| these events are held and what that, you know, blossoms into. So we'd like some consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4210)|
| 1:10:16| there. And just if the lights have to go there, we would appreciate some, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4216)|
| 1:10:22| some guidelines similar to what other parks in town have in terms of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4222)|
| 1:10:29| Let's see. That's really it. I mean, I'm supportive. I really do like what we're doing. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4229)|
| 1:10:36| understand also the big mound of dirt. I think that there's so much dirt coming out of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| fields that they have to put it somewhere so they don't have to haul it off. So I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| kind of why that 40-foot earthen mound is being installed. But some of those things, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4245)|
| 1:10:53| really understand what we're trying to do. But anyway, those are my comments. And I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4253)|
| 1:11:00| appreciate your all's time and giving me the opportunity to speak and your service. So thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4260)|
| 1:11:05| you. Thank you, Mr. Smith. Councilmembers, that concludes the speakers who signed up to speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4265)|

| 1:11:23| I do have a couple of questions. First of all, Lakeshore truly is a treasure for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4283)|
| 1:11:31| and I've spent well over half my life visiting there weekly and appreciate the investment and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4291)|
| 1:11:37| the time that the Conservancy has done as well as the city and making it a priority as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4297)|
| 1:11:48| Also, I believe as far as just helping to set the expectations for the neighbors, I think everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4308)|
| 1:11:55| seems to think that, you know, it is an asset, but also, you know, as far as taking everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4315)|
| 1:12:02| concerns into consideration. So, you know, appreciate that being done and hope that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| continue, you know, as some things are set for the record. I would like to, a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4327)|
| 1:12:15| Mr. Brase, if you could speak, I know Mr. Mullins brought it up a moment ago. Can you speak to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4335)|
| 1:12:22| North Shore entrance? Because even right now as we speak, it's hugely congested, it's a big log jam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4342)|
| 1:12:31| Kind of what plans, have you thought about that? Has there been a traffic study done or is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4351)|
| 1:12:37| one on the books to address that? Because I definitely think there's got to be some type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4357)|
| 1:12:44| solution. Mr. Brase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| Yeah, absolutely, Councilwoman Testament. Thank you for the question. I do want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4367)|
| 1:12:52| too, that it's been, I met with Mr. Smith and just a pleasure to meet with an incredibly professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| and have enjoyed receiving his feedback. I owe him an e-mail back, some information about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| investments, but he obviously has just very professionally communicated his concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| I did want Council to know, and then I'll get to the question, that I have talked with both Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| Ely and Mr. McAdams and Mr. Stare about hours, hours of operation, you know, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4395)|
| 1:13:23| lighting, should this pass, being on a timer so that they dim out at a specific time each night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4403)|
| 1:13:29| and getting that information over to Mr. Smith and others that may have concerns so that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| as Ms. Testament discussed, we have some assurances of what activities are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4415)|
| 1:13:40| happen and when. So, about the transportation on North Shore, that has been discussed for quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4420)|
| 1:13:46| some time. Actually, I bumped into Representative Daniel yesterday while voting. He has been asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4426)|
| 1:13:52| about a partnership that is, North Shore is a state route, and there is a program through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| state. We've had discussions with the state, an 80-20 program for those types of improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| where the state covers 80 and the city and the county would each cover 10 or the city would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| cover 20. But we know that there is congestion there, even without the park, there was congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4445)|
| 1:14:11| It's a busy state route. And so, we are actually, Mr. Cannon sent an email, I believe today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4451)|
| 1:14:21| to the conservancy folks about initiating the design study and starting to do due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4461)|
| 1:14:28| about what needs to happen at that location. There's lots of movements there. So, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| a greenway, there's a turn, right turn, a left turn, lots of traffic. All of that needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4473)|
| 1:14:39| analyzed, and we know that improvements need to be made there, some type of turn lane, slip lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| And so, that will happen. We also need to know exactly where that will actually happen. Where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4484)|
| 1:14:51| do we have the exit out of the park and the entrance into the park on North Shore? So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| we are starting that, and that is a critical item that we know we need to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| in the future as the park develops. Thank you. And my other question, either for Mr. McAdams or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4501)|
| 1:15:12| Mr. Stair, probably, I would just love to know, I mean, I know this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| tens of million dollar investment into this park and as the funding becomes available, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4518)|
| 1:15:24| can you speak as to sort of what the phases look like, what the priorities are for the allocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4524)|
| 1:15:32| of that funding as it becomes available as it relates to, I'll call them zones, or the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4532)|
| 1:15:39| different sections as sort of outline what that looks like in a potential timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4539)|
| 1:15:47| Mr. McAdams, do you want to address that? Yes. Am I connected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| Yes, we can hear you. Okay. The draft of the master plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4552)|
| 1:16:00| had a suggested phasing schedule, and it's a matter of balancing a number of concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4560)|
| 1:16:08| about construction. People don't want to see the park, to see it as a construction zone across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4568)|
| 1:16:16| whole park. We want to keep traffic flow and access as good as it can be. We're particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4576)|
| 1:16:25| attentive to keeping the trail open and not adversely impacting the trail user experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4585)|
| 1:16:31| keeping playgrounds open and so on. So the phased construction is driven by keeping it confined to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4591)|
| 1:16:39| one area so we disrupt as little of the park as possible. And then there's a certain logic to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4599)|
| 1:16:46| way it flows across the park. The existing upper ball fields would not be closed until the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4606)|
| 1:16:54| new ball fields are constructed. Replacement trail sections would be built before old trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4614)|
| 1:17:02| sections were closed. The architects are working now, in fact, on a scheduling map that shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4622)|
| 1:17:10| exactly which sections of the park would be impacted at which time over a period of probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4630)|
| 1:17:18| if we had all the funding today, it would probably be a four to five-year build-out cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4638)|
| 1:17:25| But again, we would be working to limit construction to specific areas of the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4645)|
| 1:17:32| so that the remainder of the park would remain open and fully usable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4652)|
| 1:17:37| The how fast all this can happen depends upon when the funding is available. I will say we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4657)|
| 1:17:45| had very generous supporters in the past, and those people have told us that they are interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4665)|
| 1:17:53| further development of the park and are willing to consider additional funding. So we're hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4673)|
| 1:18:00| optimistic that funding would be available that would let us start moving forward with the phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4680)|
| 1:18:09| two improvements as early as next spring, subject to approval of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4689)|
| 1:18:15| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Any more questions, Ms. Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. I think that's it at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Okay. Any other questions from Council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4703)|
| 1:18:31| MS. MCDOWELL. My question has essentially been addressed from the speaker, so I no longer have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4711)|
| 1:18:38| question. I will make a comment. I had similar concerns to some of the residents who reached out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4718)|
| 1:18:47| regarding lighting, traffic, all of those issues. I feel pretty confident that the city will work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4727)|
| 1:18:58| with residents to reach a plan moving forward, even if we approve this master plan tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4738)|
| 1:19:08| to reach a plan moving forward that will work for the community. I do think this is a beautiful plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4748)|
| 1:19:16| I wanted to say that. I look forward to seeing it realized. It kind of reminds me of a park in San| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4756)|
| 1:19:25| Francisco that's in a kind of urban area. And I just think it's a, I think it'll be a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4765)|
| 1:19:34| nice gem for the whole city, but especially if you live in that area, it's quite remarkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4774)|
| 1:19:40| So, I want to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| Any other further questions or discussion, Council Member Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| MS. SINGH. Thank you, Mayor. It is a very nice idea, and I think it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4789)|
| 1:19:56| be done with a lot of consideration for the traffic, for the neighbors. But while I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| hearing about this, it just, it keeps reminding me of our mental health issue. Yes, I'm going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| a buzzkill. It would have just, the money that's going to be raised is going to go for a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4807)|
| 1:20:13| purpose. But it makes me think about how much mental health care we need, and the state not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4813)|
| 1:20:21| accepting $7 trillion or so that could help with all that. It's just a damn shame. But that doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4821)|
| 1:20:29| have to do with the improvements on the park. I'm excited about that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Thank you, Council Member Singh. Council Member Rodgers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| COMMISSIONER RODGERS. I just wanted to thank Mr. Sayre, Mr. McAdams, Ms. Foy for answering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4839)|
| 1:20:47| questions and spending time and going through the plan with us. I wanted to ask a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4847)|
| 1:20:53| about something that Mr. Smith brought up a moment ago. He referred to it as the earthen mound, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4853)|
| 1:21:01| this may be a question for the landscape architect. But I guess on page 24, I just was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4861)|
| 1:21:08| trying to better understand what he meant. There's a sculptural mound. Is that what he was referring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4868)|
| 1:21:14| to? And could you tell me a little bit more about that? I was reading the description on page 24,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4874)|
| 1:21:21| but maybe explain. VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Mr. Waltz or Reitner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4881)|
| 1:21:26| THOMAS WALTZ. Yes, this is Thomas Waltz. I'm on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Are you the landscape? Are you in a position to answer this question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| THOMAS WALTZ. I am in a position to answer the question. My name is Thomas Waltz. I'm the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| and principal of Nelson Bird Waltz Landscape Architects in Charlottesville, Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| And thank you, Council Member Reiter, for your question. The sculptural mound, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4903)|
| 1:21:51| stands at the intersection of being pragmatic about the earth required to level to make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4911)|
| 1:22:00| premium ball field experience that we're trying to create without paying to haul that soil away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4920)|
| 1:22:08| So something we thought very interesting to do with it would be to make something artful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| like an earthwork work of art out of it, but also strategically locate it so that it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4934)|
| 1:22:22| block a number of views to the sewage treatment plant that is visible from many parts of the lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4942)|
| 1:22:29| half of the park. So it serves multiple functions of sort of an economic way to consume the soil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4949)|
| 1:22:40| generated. It probably, as we grade down, won't be very high-quality soil. It's not like rich top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4960)|
| 1:22:47| soil or loam. It's going to be more clay-based. So the core of the mound would be that clay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4967)|
| 1:22:53| And then the topsoil removed during construction will be spread again on top of it. We have made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4973)|
| 1:23:02| a walk that would be a hard surface, a concrete walking surface that takes you to the very top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4982)|
| 1:23:08| of the mound. I believe it tops out at 30 feet and would provide views back to the overlook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4988)|
| 1:23:18| out over the river and to the mountains. And there are a series of arcing benches proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=4998)|
| 1:23:24| at the highest point of the mound to provide prospect, screen the sewage treatment plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| and prevent us from many, many haul trips of removing soil from the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| Okay. Thank you for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| Thank you, Mr. Walts. Any further questions or comments from council members? Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5020)|
| 1:23:49| Yes, just briefly. In my conferences with the Lakeshore Park Conservancy, of course, one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5029)|
| 1:23:57| concerns that we've talked about quite a bit is the neighboring residences and some connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5037)|
| 1:24:04| issues. And with a project this size, they assured me that there would be a continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5044)|
| 1:24:11| collaboration with the residences and with other issues that might come up. So I'm impressed with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5051)|
| 1:24:18| the plan, impressed with the openness that the Conservancy had, and just the confidence I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5058)|
| 1:24:27| that they will continue to listen to the concerns of the neighbors and issues regarding access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5067)|
| 1:24:33| the park makes me very supportive. Thank you. Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5073)|
| 1:24:40| Council Member Smith. I just want to say that I frequent the park quite a bit and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5080)|

| 1:25:17| that we be mindful of Mr. Smith and Mr. Mullen's concerns. So thank you. Thank you, Council Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5117)|

| 1:27:20| to You program. Just first would say thank you for your diligence in this. We're just one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5240)|
| 1:27:26| many cities that are going to participate in this vision, and we've long neglected one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5246)|
| 1:27:33| the greatest assets we have in our city, which is the Tennessee River that starts here. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5253)|
| 1:27:39| thank you for leading that vision beyond Knoxville. But if you could explain the 652| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| to You program, I think it's really important for everybody to understand that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5262)|
| 1:27:49| Sure. I'd be happy to share some insight into that and want to thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5269)|
| 1:27:54| Before you get started, just tell us who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| Sure. So my name is Brad Collett. I'm an associate professor at the University of Tennessee in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5278)|

| 1:28:20| benefit that is offered to communities that are enrolling in the Tennessee River Towns program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5300)|

| 1:28:55| to appreciate the resources that we have here locally and benefit from. Knoxville will be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5335)|

| 1:29:08| that vision. We do offer a program called 652 to You, which is a week-long investment of energy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5348)|
| 1:29:19| resources by the Tennessee River Line staff to stimulate and develop a dialogue within Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5359)|
| 1:29:26| River communities about their relationship with the Tennessee River. And so we're very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5366)|
| 1:29:31| much looking forward to engaging the city of Knoxville through their participation in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5371)|
| 1:29:36| River Towns program as a participant in this exclusive benefit of that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5376)|
| 1:29:47| Okay. Thank you very much. I'm really excited about this. I think it brings a lot to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5387)|
| 1:29:54| Council Member Thomas. Yes, I would only add, Mr. Collett, you probably listened to the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| item on the agenda, and the Tennessee River runs right by Lakeshore Park. So there might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5399)|
| 1:30:05| somebody you want to collaborate with as far as access. Thank you. Indeed. And if I may respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| to that comment, Councilman Thomas, we actually have had the benefit of speaking with the Conservancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5410)|
| 1:30:18| as well as the consulting team to this project. We understand that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| challenges that lie in the way of creating robust river access from Lakeshore Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5422)|
| 1:30:28| but we're willing and able to be a partner to those dialogues that can hopefully make Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5428)|
| 1:30:37| Park a gateway both to and from our community to the Tennessee River. So thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5437)|

| 1:31:20| have a chance to show us that badge one time soon. But I just wanted to put that in there. You need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| a smile and all the other things that we do. So thank you all very much. And thank you, Brad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| for allowing him to sit with us. Thank you, Cheryl. Before he left, he asked if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5488)|
| 1:31:34| Thank you, Cheryl. Before he left, he asked if the Council members ever voted no. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5494)|

| 1:35:14| current maximum size of 24 square feet, which is allowed in the Office District. While we agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5714)|
| 1:35:21| that a maximum size of 24 square feet is too restrictive in the Office Park District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5721)|
| 1:35:27| it should be noted that to date, there has been only one application made to the Board of Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| Appeals for an attached sign greater than 24 square feet in the Office District Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5732)|

| 1:35:45| can be up to 5% of the square footage of the primary facade. But to be consistent with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5745)|

| 1:36:02| Since the limit on building height in this district is 50 feet, this maximum cap would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5762)|
| 1:36:10| only come into play when a building facade is greater than 50 feet tall by 60 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5770)|
| 1:36:17| or 3,000 square feet. A 3,000 square foot facade would yield a sign of 150 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5777)|
| 1:36:24| at 5% of the facade. I hope it's clear to council, based on the history I related to you two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5784)|

| 1:37:14| members, there's a motion on the floor. Do you have questions or comments, discussion? Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| member Ryder. Yeah, so I have a question about, does anybody else have a question they might want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5839)|
| 1:37:28| to ask while I try and find the right part of the packet? Am I the only one? I'm sure there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5848)|
| 1:37:36| might be some others. Does anyone else have a question or comment? Yeah, I can clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5856)|
| 1:37:41| something really quickly. What is before us creates a maximum size, maximum sign size based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5861)|
| 1:37:55| the size of the building. It does not limit it to a certain square footage. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5875)|
| 1:38:10| I'm going to ask either Amy Brooks or Stephanie Welch to speak to this. Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5890)|
| 1:38:16| Sure. This is Amy Brooks. Yes, that's correct, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5896)|
| 1:38:24| Okay, thank you. Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| Thank you, Mayor. It looks to me like, and I had a conversation with Deputy Mayor Gill about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5909)|
| 1:38:37| but I think some of the language may be twisted around a little bit on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5917)|
| 1:38:44| because it looks like we're allowing all uses in the office park to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5924)|
| 1:38:51| illuminated, internally illuminated signs. But I think the intent was to allow the hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5931)|
| 1:39:00| or healthcare facilities with attached emergency rooms to have internally illuminated signs if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5940)|
| 1:39:07| go through a master sign plan. And I don't know if Ms. Gill or Director Brooks would be better to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5947)|
| 1:39:17| respond to that, but I just wanted to make sure that that was a correct interpretation of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5957)|
| 1:39:22| language that's in front of us. I'm happy to speak to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| Council Member Roberto. So in the current code, as it is on the books right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5967)|
| 1:39:33| office parks are not allowed to have internally illuminated signs with the exception of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| healthcare facilities who have to go through a master sign plan in order to be granted that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5978)|
| 1:39:44| allowance. We do feel like there could be an argument to be made that internally illuminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5984)|
| 1:39:50| signs in office parks generally would be appropriate. However, if Council is concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5990)|
| 1:39:57| to limit that and essentially maintain the status quo in terms of that restriction on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=5997)|
| 1:40:03| internal illumination, we don't feel we're very neutral on that point. So you would certainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6003)|
| 1:40:10| you would not find our opposition in creating language and clarifying that signs both in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6010)|
| 1:40:18| office and office parks district are restricted from internal illumination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| Well, I guess my question is, does the amendment, as is written in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| does it allow for internal illumination of all uses in the office park? And then if a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6028)|
| 1:40:35| or a healthcare facility with an emergency room wants to do the same thing, they have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6035)|
| 1:40:40| a master sign plan. Yeah, I think that's partly what we acknowledge is that that language is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6040)|
| 1:40:46| confusing and perhaps not aligned with what the spirit was intended to allow. So again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6046)|
| 1:40:53| this is something where I think I've talked with several of you about an edit that can be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| pretty straightforward to address that and essentially maintain the status quo, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6058)|
| 1:41:04| a restriction on internal illumination for all users within office parks with the allowance for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6064)|
| 1:41:11| healthcare facilities to pursue a master sign plan if they have an emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| Okay, thank you. So what I see from what you had sent me, the option for doing that would be to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6076)|
| 1:41:23| strike out such signs in the O district and replace that and just keep it going at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6083)|
| 1:41:31| point. The signs in the office districts cannot be internally illuminated, but may be externally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6091)|
| 1:41:37| illuminated provided that no light source is visible from the public right-of-way or adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6097)|
| 1:41:42| properties. And my interpretation of that, I just want to make sure it's right, if we make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6102)|
| 1:41:48| change, then all uses in office park won't be able to internally illuminate as they do currently or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6108)|
| 1:41:56| as they're not able to do currently. But a hospital or a healthcare facility with an emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6116)|
| 1:42:02| could by use of a master sign plan. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6122)|
| 1:42:08| Okay. Then I'd make that motion to make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6128)|
| 1:42:14| I'll second that motion. Okay, there's a motion to amend it for just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6134)|
| 1:42:20| per that discussion made by Council Member Roberto, seconded by Council Member Rodgers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6140)|
| 1:42:26| and Council Member Coogan. So let's, so Council Member Smith, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6146)|
| 1:42:33| I have a question, yes. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| Either Deputy Gill or Ms. Brooks, if one of you could clarify the process of the master sign plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6155)|
| 1:42:42| and what that process looks like or how it's submitted, or is it submitted only as part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6162)|
| 1:42:50| a variance? It's got an active role in this. And so I want to make sure everybody understands what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6170)|
| 1:42:55| that role is. Yes, I can take that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6175)|
| 1:43:02| So master sign plans, you mentioned variances. Council Member Smith, the variances have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| approved before a master sign. Any variances that are required have to be approved before a master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| sign plan is submitted and reviewed. So master sign plan comes in to planning and it is reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6191)|
| 1:43:19| by planning staff alongside city staff as well and is presented to, a recommendation is presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6199)|
| 1:43:26| to the Planning Commission for their review and approval. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6206)|
| 1:43:36| Council Member Rodgers. Could I ask Ms. Gill or Mr. Aarons if he's on the call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6216)|
| 1:43:43| about the one sign that needed a variance for the 5 percent? Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6223)|
| 1:43:52| Ms. Gill or Mr. Aarons, can you address that? So I think in general, you know, there are many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6232)|
| 1:43:59| examples that I believe Mr. Aarons could speak to regarding where variances have been needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6239)|
| 1:44:05| There is an example in what is now an office park district, but what was currently a commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6245)|
| 1:44:10| district, where South College is located at the far west end of the city near Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6250)|
| 1:44:18| And that is an example where they have multiple signs on different dimensions or, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6258)|
| 1:44:24| different, I guess we would call it facades of their building. It's a very large, long building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| out there. And each sign is 165 square feet. So that's an example of the, and just one example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6268)|
| 1:44:38| where a cap would have prevented them from pursuing that sign. And in any case, and in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6278)|
| 1:44:46| case, they had to go through the variance process because they had been rezoned into office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6286)|
| 1:44:51| And as you can see in the current code languages on the books today, that is, they're subject to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6291)|
| 1:44:56| a restriction there that's just very mismatched with the size of the building that they're dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| with. So that's one example where a very recent applicant has run up against an example that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6301)|
| 1:45:09| would have bumped them beyond the 150 square foot limit that has been discussed by members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6309)|
| 1:45:17| public. Does that answer your question? It does. So let me ask you this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6317)|
| 1:45:24| or ask Ms. Brooks this question. In commercial and industrial sign standards, we have maximal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6324)|
| 1:45:33| allowable sign standards, like 200 square feet, if it's within 500 feet of an interstate interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6333)|
| 1:45:40| So we have maximum caps on many things. What is the rationale behind having no cap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6340)|
| 1:45:49| So I think I would, you know, maybe in an office park, colleagues, an opportunity to comment on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6349)|
| 1:45:55| this. But one of the perspectives that I would want to offer is, again, you know, as we look across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6355)|
| 1:46:01| office parks, they are very large buildings, typically, not all, but in office parks in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6361)|
| 1:46:07| different way than is permitted within just an office building. We've seen multiple examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6367)|
| 1:46:12| where the facade is significant, and the proportional sign to go on a very large building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6372)|
| 1:46:21| is variable, depending on kind of how many letters, for example, might be in the applicant's name. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6381)|
| 1:46:27| they are a long-named applicant, they have large letters, and there's just a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6387)|
| 1:46:33| So again, the approach of floating the size of the signs proportionally to the size of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6393)|
| 1:46:40| the size of the signs proportional to the size of the facade, we feel allows an appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6400)|
| 1:46:47| restriction so that these signs do not get out of sync with the size of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| But we also have avoided the introduction of an arbitrary cap that would create the need for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6412)|
| 1:46:57| potential variances for what otherwise might be a very minor and imperceptible difference on a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6417)|
| 1:47:04| facade. Thank you, Ms. Gill. Ms. Welch, did you have something to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6424)|
| 1:47:13| Yes, Mayor, thank you. I just wanted to add to, I think, Ms. Gill gave a very good explanation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6433)|
| 1:47:20| but from an economic development standpoint, office parks are oftentimes where headquarters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6440)|
| 1:47:26| locate, so like pilot headquarters, et cetera. So we are, you know, I think that when it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6446)|
| 1:47:36| to locating headquarters types of offices in office parks, depending on the size of their name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6456)|
| 1:47:45| and sort of the plan they have for their logo, we feel like a proportionate size is more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6465)|
| 1:47:54| than saying here's sort of this arbitrary square footage that we're going to ask you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6474)|
| 1:48:00| fall into. So we have seen one variance I think that Ms. Gill described pretty accurately, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6480)|
| 1:48:08| see this as the potential of being problematic as we continue our economic development recruitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6488)|
| 1:48:15| efforts and the potential of having that square footage cap. We feel like the proportionality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6495)|
| 1:48:21| is probably more important to the aesthetics of the office park than if a building is that large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6501)|
| 1:48:29| then we know that we need, they also need a sign that is proportionate to the size of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6509)|
| 1:48:37| Thank you, Ms. Welch. So is Mr. Ahrens on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6517)|
| 1:48:44| Yes, ma'am. So if so, limit an office park is for 50 feet tall. I know this is kind of arbitrary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6524)|
| 1:48:53| question. I'm trying to visualize an office park. I know there's some off of Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6533)|
| 1:48:59| level road area. What's a dimension of one of those buildings? I know I've been to one out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6539)|
| 1:49:09| there, and the building ends up being like maybe a half a city block long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6549)|
| 1:49:16| How many? I'm just trying to understand what 5% of something ends up being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6556)|
| 1:49:23| Mr. Ahrens? Yes, ma'am. Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Building Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6563)|
| 1:49:28| I think the key that we're trying to articulate is that with detached signs that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6568)|
| 1:49:34| caps, very rigid caps, that's because you're basically along the roadside, and it's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6574)|
| 1:49:45| relation to the road and the type of road. And when you have a higher road, a higher capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6585)|
| 1:49:51| road upwards to an interstate, you're allowed a larger and taller sign. Whereas what's being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6591)|
| 1:49:57| proposed tonight is strictly based on the size of the structure. And as you'll see, it's 5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6597)|
| 1:50:05| is half of what's permitted in any of the commercial or industrial districts. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6605)|
| 1:50:12| I can't answer your direct question as to how big the buildings are in office parks. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6612)|
| 1:50:19| it's just important to recognize that what's being proposed is a larger and taller sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6619)|
| 1:50:26| What's being proposed is half of what's permitted in the commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6626)|
| 1:50:34| Thank you, Mr. Ahrens. Ms. Ryder, does that answer your question or give some follow-up questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6634)|
| 1:50:43| Yeah. So I guess one of the things that I will state I think is important for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| discussion for the record is that Ms. Gill and I had a conversation this afternoon in regard to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6648)|
| 1:50:55| in regards to some of this. And I, as a council member, would like to be aware of the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6655)|
| 1:51:05| I may be getting the agendas for the BZA meetings. But for me, it's important in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6665)|
| 1:51:16| conceptualizing what the issue is to know like, oh, we had one variance. And I'd like to see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6676)|
| 1:51:23| applications versus just, I'd like to understand the full issue is I guess what I'm trying to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6683)|
| 1:51:31| at. So if we're making code changes based on repeated problems or something that's a common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6691)|
| 1:51:39| barrier, I'd like to see the examples to be able to examine like exactly how much of a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6699)|
| 1:51:47| they needed, what the hardship was, and so how the code is a barrier for future reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6707)|
| 1:51:56| Okay, Mr. Ahrens, can you make sure council members who want to send that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6716)|
| 1:52:02| and maybe it's all of them, have access to the BZA agendas and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6722)|
| 1:52:07| I'll go back and make sure that I get the BZA agendas. I just mean when we're having a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6727)|
| 1:52:13| and staff is like, this has been an issue, I'd like to see the example of the issue if it's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6733)|
| 1:52:18| we're making a decision based upon. Mr. Ahrens, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6738)|
| 1:52:25| Yes, ma'am. We'll be sure that she gets all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| She'll get the BZA variance requests every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| I may already be getting them. I'm just saying if we're going to pick one and say it's the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6754)|
| 1:52:39| to make a decision, I'd like it to be part of the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6759)|
| 1:52:43| I see. Okay. I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6763)|
| 1:52:49| Ms. Huguett. I think Councilwoman Parker had her hand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6769)|
| 1:52:53| before me, so you go and I'll... Okay. Now, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6773)|
| 1:52:58| Mine is really quick. I just want to repeat the example that was used that needed a variance for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6778)|
| 1:53:06| 165 foot sign. Sure. Thank you. The example that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6786)|
| 1:53:14| cited was South College in what used to be the former Goody's headquarters. It's very far out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6794)|
| 1:53:22| west. I guess even between then, it's on Goody's Lane, but it was Kimberly-Clark prior to South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6802)|
| 1:53:28| College. It is a large, long building that has, I don't know the full frontage of the square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6808)|
| 1:53:37| but what they have proposed are a series of three signs that are on different directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6817)|
| 1:53:46| If you're coming from the west, the one side of the building. If you're coming from the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6826)|
| 1:53:50| or north, you see another side and east. There's three different signs. Each of them are sized at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6830)|
| 1:53:56| 165 square feet. This is an office park. In this case, it's adjacent to an interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6836)|
| 1:54:04| and that's very much a part of the brand that has been part of that building and is continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| under the South College ownership. They came to the BZA early in the year having been rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6848)|
| 1:54:16| office park. They were prior in a different zone, and so under the new recode rules, they fell into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6856)|
| 1:54:22| office park, and thus the plans for their sign were no longer allowed. So they took it to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6862)|
| 1:54:29| BZA, and it's simply used as an example of where you can have a sign that's very proportional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6869)|
| 1:54:36| to the size of the building and yet would exceed that 150 square foot cap. Does that answer your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6876)|
| 1:54:43| question? Oh, it does. Yeah, I missed the business South College, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6883)|
| 1:54:52| Thank you, Ms. Parker. Thank you, Ms. Gill. Ms. Fugate, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6892)|
| 1:54:57| Thank you. Just a quick follow-up. This is a very tough issue, but the proportionality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6897)|
| 1:55:04| issue is real, and speaking to architect friends when they talk about designing buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6904)|
| 1:55:09| and designing signage, they look to make them proportional to the size of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6909)|
| 1:55:17| and the only other comment I will make is while Deputy Mayor Gill shared with us an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6917)|
| 1:55:28| Deputy Mayor Welch also talked about anticipated needs related to economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6928)|
| 1:55:35| and if, I think, I don't want to put words in her mouth, but the gist of what I got was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6935)|
| 1:55:42| if as we recruit new headquarters, if there are issues with their signage and they have to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6942)|
| 1:55:49| through variances, and we also hear that we can be a difficult place to do business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6949)|
| 1:55:55| will that impact us in the ability to attract some more corporate citizens to Knoxville? And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6955)|
| 1:56:03| I'm not sure if Ms. Welch, I paraphrased what you said, Deputy Mayor, but that's kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6963)|
| 1:56:09| another example I thought we were giving about why this issue might be important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6969)|
| 1:56:17| Thank you, Council Member Fugate. Ms. Welch, did you want to just confirm that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6977)|
| 1:56:24| those remarks, if that captured what you were trying to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| Yes, thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Councilwoman Fugate. I think you captured it very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6987)|
| 1:56:33| very well. Thank you. Just wanted to make sure I wasn't speaking incorrectly for you. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=6993)|
| 1:56:44| Any further comments or questions? I think what we're considering right now is the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7004)|
| 1:56:50| Does everyone understand what they're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7010)|
| 1:56:56| Mayor, could I ask for clarity on the amendments? It is my understanding that it's a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7016)|
| 1:57:02| strike and insert language. Can I get the... Mr. Rivera, as the maker of the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7022)|
| 1:57:07| could you clarify? Yes, Mayor, thank you. Will, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7027)|
| 1:57:14| the part that starts such signs in the O district, that would be removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7034)|
| 1:57:21| and then the rest of the sentence would say, signs in the office districts, plural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7041)|
| 1:57:28| cannot be internally illuminated, but may be externally illuminated provided that no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7048)|
| 1:57:34| light source is visible from the public right of way or adjacent properties. Okay. I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7054)|
| 1:57:39| you're striking that first part and inserting signs in the office districts. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7059)|
| 1:57:46| Thank you. Okay, does everyone understand the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7066)|
| 1:57:54| Okay, then seeing no further questions, Mr. Johnson, please conduct a roll call vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7074)|
| 1:58:00| the amendment. Council Member Berto? Yes. Council Member Singh? Yes. Council Member Smith? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7080)|

| 1:58:32| Okay, the amendment carries. Now we're back to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7112)|
| 1:58:37| Is there any further questions or comments on the motion as amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7117)|
| 1:58:44| Okay, seeing none, please conduct a roll call vote. Council Member Testerman? Yes. Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7124)|
| 1:58:55| I'm going to abstain on the first reading. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| Council Member Fugate? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7137)|

| 1:59:33| Okay, so the motion carries with seven ayes, one abstention, and one no. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7173)|
| 1:59:38| Yes, ma'am. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7178)|
| 1:59:43| That concludes our agenda, and nobody signed up for public forum. And it's two hours, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7183)|
| 1:59:51| it's a record for us, maybe. Good job. Thank you very much. We started at five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7191)|
| 1:59:57| I told you to go back before we started this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201020?start=7197)|
