| 0:41:46| I just want to speak a little bit about why we're having this special call meeting. I think there's been some confusion about that and in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2506)|
| 0:41:56| Board members, as you know, we all received an email from Mr. Dupler telling us that it was the law department's recommendation that we do this, so that's pretty much how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2516)|
| 0:42:12| And that email was attorney-client privileged. I know that there have been some media requests for it, so if there aren't any objections, I would like for Mr. Dupler just to speak a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2532)|
| 0:42:24| If board members don't object to him just sharing what the law department's advice to board members was. Is that good? All right. Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2544)|
| 0:42:37| All right. Thank you, Madam Chair. So yes, I did send an email on behalf of the law department after the board's 4-4 tie vote at the last meeting on the charter school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2557)|
| 0:42:51| And I think confusion is probably the operative word there. You know, the recommendation to have this meeting tonight was to avoid confusion and make things clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2571)|
| 0:43:07| And what I'll do is I'll just read from part of the email. Without a clear denial with reasons or an approval, the applicant and its supporters are left wondering if they will be approved by default or if they should respond to the denial without clear reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2587)|
| 0:43:25| Likewise, opponents of the proposed school are left to wonder if the denial without reasons is good, quote-unquote, and whether they will need to file without a clear denial. Was that me? Wow. I didn't know I sounded like that. Yeah. It's like from the ceiling or something. Yeah, I hope not either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2605)|
| 0:43:52| OK, so and whether or not they will need to file an action to block or an approval, block an approval by default. Julie Thompson and I both reached out to our consultant, Ms. Swan, who helped us throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2632)|
| 0:44:11| And she had not seen a situation like this in her experience where there was a tie vote with a board. And I made a joke there and I'll refrain from that. But, you know, likewise, we also heard from state officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2651)|
| 0:44:31| Julie Thompson and I did both both TDOE and the Charter Commission. And they also recommended that Knox County Board of Education should should make the situation clear. And again, let me just make it clear from the law department. Law department's not not not taking a side on this. I mean, you know, it's it's it's whatever the board wants. It's the board's will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2671)|
| 0:44:55| So so what I did was drafted two proposed resolutions. And of course, the board members can discuss those resolutions, make changes to those resolutions if you would like. But but if the board votes tonight, either, you know, approve or deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2695)|
| 0:45:13| And if there is a denial, include the reasons with a resolution, then then at that point, everything is clear and the charter school folks will know what to do. And and we go forward. So that was the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2713)|
| 0:45:29| All right. Thank you, Mr. Dupont. So do we have a motion to approve the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2729)|
| 0:45:37| So motion by Miss Horn is second by Mr. Triplett. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| Point of inquiry, please. Will there be a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2741)|
| 0:45:48| Direction of how we're going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| Well, we will make a motion to a to approve the agenda. And I do have a note here that Miss Horn, since she was not here at the last meeting, would like to speak a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2751)|
| 0:46:08| And then we'll just entertain motions of, you know, which direction the board wants to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| I mean, you can make a motion to approve, but we have to approve the agenda first, which is where we're at right now. So we until we do that, we can't really even discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2774)|
| 0:46:24| So so we have a motion by Miss Horn to approve the agenda and a second by Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2784)|
| 0:46:30| I'd like to request a roll call vote on approving the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| Dr. Butler. Yes. Miss Owen. Mr. Watson. Yes. Miss Byke. Miss Horn. Miss Henderson. Mr. Triplett. Mr. McMillan. Miss Christie. Yes. Miss Byke. Would you like to change your path?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2794)|
| 0:46:52| That's seven yes, one no vote and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| So the motion carries. So we have approved the agenda and I am going to allow Miss Horn to speak since she was not here and has not really had the opportunity to speak yet at our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2814)|
| 0:47:06| And she had requested to do so. So Miss Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| I'm not trying to supersede Miss Horn, but I do think that I need to understand what the process is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2830)|
| 0:47:21| And my concern is that I want to make sure that everyone and if I'm going to be honest, especially me, get a point to share my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2841)|
| 0:47:33| Well, so in my role as chair, I will do this meeting as I would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2853)|
| 0:47:40| I'm not trying to supersede Miss Horn, but I do think that I need to understand what the process is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| And my concern is that I want to make sure that everyone and if I'm going to be honest, especially me, get a point to share my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2866)|
| 0:47:57| Well, so in my role as chair, I will do this meeting as I would any other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| Someone makes a motion and we would ask for discussion. It would be just like any other meeting as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2883)|
| 0:48:11| Okay, I just wanted to make sure that I'm clear. I'd like to be clear up front because I'm back in being clear doesn't always serve you well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2891)|
| 0:48:19| But I don't want it to be a situation where we call for the question before everyone has a chance to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2899)|
| 0:48:26| Well, again, in my role as chair, I have no control over the motions other board members make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2906)|
| 0:48:33| I mean, if someone were to do that, there would have to be a second and a vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| And correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Dupler, but that's pretty much how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2918)|
| 0:48:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| I mean, that's correct. Certainly this board has traditionally made a practice of allowing some discussion among board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2927)|
| 0:48:58| But according to Robert's rules, if there were a motion to call for the question and it were successful, then that would cut off discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2938)|
| 0:49:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| So, sir, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2953)|
| 0:49:21| Yes, yes, that's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| Okay, so are we good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| Yes, I'm good. I'm just waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| And I was just going to make a statement first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| I wasn't planning on making a motion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| I can do that if that would be better, which it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| That's my problem right there, is that you've given her the opportunity to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| I was not planning to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| That's not in my comments, so I'll just go ahead and make my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| I have a point of order, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| Could you speak to the appropriateness of having a predetermined order for speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=2992)|
| 0:50:02| If I may, I had said to Ms. Coatney that I would like to speak to her because I wasn't here at the last meeting and I didn't have the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3002)|
| 0:50:11| That's simply it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| I yield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| Okay, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| I think the only board meetings that I've missed over the past six years were three weeks ago when this application was before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3017)|
| 0:50:26| So timing was not the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| But I can assure you that I've watched every minute of the nine-plus hours of meetings that took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| and I've spoken with staff members and several community members, so I'm up to speed on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| I've gotten lots of emails, so I appreciate all that input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| I wholeheartedly believe in the right of parents to determine where their children go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3047)|
| 0:50:53| As Mr. Triplett stated in one of the meetings, parents will decide whether this school is needed and utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3053)|
| 0:50:59| I don't think we can presume to know what's best for every student or every single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3059)|
| 0:51:05| Parents know what's best for their children and are the decision makers for their children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| and we can certainly trust parents to make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| I've heard from parents who are in favor of this school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| and I received an email that Ms. Byke had asked Ms. Coatney to forward to the board with a parent who was expressing just that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3080)|
| 0:51:29| and I thought that her points were very well explained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| So anyway, I realize that many in the community are concerned about this taking resources from existing schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3093)|
| 0:51:45| and a new school could and could do that, certainly, and likely will in the future impact probably every one of our high schools and our middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3105)|
| 0:51:55| And it's important to remember that we have students at every one of our schools who have transferred into those schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3115)|
| 0:52:02| so I have no doubt that it will affect probably every high school and middle school in the district when it's said and done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3122)|
| 0:52:11| And it's also important that I note that many of the people that I represent are very much in favor of charter schools and parents having more choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3131)|
| 0:52:19| Our state government has in place a mechanism for charter schools to exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| and this entity has a proven concept in Chattanooga, so I see no reason why the state would not approve this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3143)|
| 0:52:31| I'm thankful the applicants have a desire to work closely with KCS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| and if this application is approved, I think we should all want very much for the children who attend the school to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3155)|
| 0:52:42| They are our fellow citizens and the leaders of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| I have loved our public school experience, and it's served my kids and our family very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| and my hope is that Knox County Schools will be the school of choice for parents and students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| I think it's incumbent upon our school district and this board and the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| to be sure that we are poised to be the best choice for students in every single zip code in our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| and I commend Dr. Reiswick for the work currently being done to put together a comprehensive strategy for the Region 5 schools and the four focus areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3189)|
| 0:53:19| And my final point is this. Our board appointed a charter review committee to review the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3199)|
| 0:53:27| They spent hours doing this, and I feel like they objectively reviewed and recommended this application based on the information they had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3207)|
| 0:53:35| and that's another reason that I'm planning to vote for this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| This issue has been thoroughly discussed in the past two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| I hope that we don't feel like all of that has to be recapped. As I said, I've watched all of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| I know Reverend Butler has already expressed that he'd like to make a comment, so I think he certainly should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| but I would hope that you don't feel the need to recap every single point because I have watched all those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3235)|
| 0:54:02| and I appreciate the opportunity to speak. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3242)|
| 0:54:09| Thank you, Madam Chair. I move that the board deny the public charter school application filed by Knoxville Preparatory School Prep Public Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3249)|
| 0:54:21| Ms. Coatney's telling me she needs to read the item into record, and then we'll go right back to you, and you can make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3261)|
| 0:54:28| Item four, consideration of resolutions to approve or deny the Knoxville Preparatory School Prep Public Schools charter school application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3268)|
| 0:54:40| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| Okay, I've practiced pronouncing all those words right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| I move that the Knox County Board of Education deny the public charter school application filed by Knoxville Preparatory School Prep Public Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3287)|
| 0:54:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| So we have a motion to deny made by Reverend Butler, a second by Ms. Owen. Discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3301)|
| 0:55:10| I'd like to speak briefly, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| So I appreciate Ms. Owen's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| We have had a lot of discussion about this and a lot of letters, both for and against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3320)|
| 0:55:29| The resolution that we are looking at, the motion that's just been made, I want to thank Mr. Dupler for putting it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3329)|
| 0:55:38| It's pretty much exactly what we had talked about and presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| I do respect parents' desire for choice for their students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3344)|
| 0:55:53| I had the same for mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| I want one of my kids to have the best education possible, and likewise for my grandchildren, regardless of where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3354)|
| 0:56:04| And I respect those who have wrote letters and articles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| Some of them I know very well and have been in relationship and worship and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3369)|
| 0:56:17| And then also I respect those who have talked about what they are against, why they are against charter schools in general, but this particular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3377)|
| 0:56:28| But honestly, I never thought it was about any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| From what I read in the beginning that it was about the way that the state said that we would process our approval or denial for the charter school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3393)|
| 0:56:46| And that's exactly what I felt like we would look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| So all those other issues, although from our different perspectives they may be very accurate or not, they're not the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3410)|
| 0:56:59| The issue is the application itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| The state presented an application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| It was developed by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| The application itself was developed by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| The process was put in place by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| And we looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| I do thank the committee for their good hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| They were very thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| But the first time they presented it at the work meeting, I asked the question, did you check the data that the statements were based on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3441)|
| 0:57:30| And they said they did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| So we checked the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| And there is discrepancies in the areas that's listed in this resolution with the state data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3456)|
| 0:57:44| Now, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| And that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| That's in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| You look at their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| You look at the state data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| They're different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| We've heard their justification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| And I'm not disagreeing with their justification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| But when I asked the superintendent, when Knox County Schools has a discrepancy with the state data, then we go back to the state and we challenge it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3483)|
| 0:58:12| And we seek to have that data changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| And that's what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| That's the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| So that would be the same process for this charter school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| I don't think if we apply for something and we put data in there and the data is inconsistent with the state, that the grant provider is going to have the superintendent say, well, just take my word for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3502)|
| 0:58:32| I stand by my data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| They're going to want something from the state to say either their data is wrong or our data is wrong or our data is right or their data is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3515)|
| 0:58:43| So we don't have that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| So I think it is incumbent upon this board to be honest with ourselves and look at it the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| Because unless something here is wrong, I think we have to vote against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| I once again want to make sure that I think that whatever we do, we want to provide the best education for all of our children and give them the most choices, give parents the most choices that they can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3538)|
| 0:59:11| And I am part of that group that wants that for their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3551)|
| 0:59:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| I have a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| Mr. Diepler, is it true you can only move in the affirmative according to Robert's rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| Isn't that what you said last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| So would we need to, like in this case, you wrote the resolution, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| So I believe Reverend Butler's motion was to deny the charter school application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3575)|
| 0:59:48| Reverend Butler probably needs to perhaps restate the motion, but I mean from what he was describing, it sounds like he's asking that the resolution to deny be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3588)|
| 1:00:02| So thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3602)|
| 1:00:08| I was going by the therefore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| So help me with the correction, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| I think that, well, I mean, ultimately it's the same thing, but because we have the two resolutions that were attached, so instead of making the motion to deny the application, I'm assuming what your intent is to approve the resolution that denies the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3617)|
| 1:00:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| Ms. Jennifer needs to-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| Sure, I accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| And Ms. Owen, I believe you are next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| I'm going to go ahead and defer to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| I don't know who that Robert guy was, but he's made things really difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| I do appreciate the structure, but I know sometimes it can be limiting as we try to navigate that and figure out what the implications are for the decisions that we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3673)|
| 1:01:22| So thank you for always being willing to help clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| I'm just going to make a brief statement, and it's going to be about the decision we made and the way we're making the decision, and I'm going to re-elevate the reason why I'm making my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3685)|
| 1:01:35| And I'm going to make a point that may seem odd to make in this moment, but to me this is a good case study in order to make the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3695)|
| 1:01:45| Any major decision that we've made as a board over the last nine months has split the vote the exact same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3705)|
| 1:01:53| And I would assume that tonight this vote is going to split the exact same way again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| I really wanted to vote for this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| I do not have a policy issue with charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| I understand the reasons why some people do, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| I also believe in choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| I've leveraged choice with my own kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| I know that my kids have very unique needs, even within my household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| And I think all of us as parents want the best for our individual children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| And I think that's really true of anybody that's sitting around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| I don't think that's what the argument is really about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| And I made my decision to vote no, and it will remain the same for one reason, and it's what I stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3750)|
| 1:02:36| That I felt like in the time that I've been following the school and engaging with the school that people who did support them in the beginning withdrew support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3756)|
| 1:02:44| And to me that's concerning simply from a leadership standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| Whenever you're starting something new in a community, that leadership to lose support that quickly was concerning for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3767)|
| 1:02:54| And I was honest with that, with the leadership of that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| I think they understand the reasons why I voted for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| But I really wanted to vote yes, not so that we have a vote that splits differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| but because I think it's really important for us as a board to really be willing to move past ideological stances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3786)|
| 1:03:15| and lean into only what people above us say that we should lean into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| And I'm not saying individuals on this board are doing that with this particular decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| But when a board consistently splits the exact same way on every major decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| I think it's hard for the public to really trust that we're willing to dig in and compromise and ask the tough questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3811)|
| 1:03:38| The other thing that we'll notice in these conversations is some of us asked a lot of questions and some of us asked no questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3818)|
| 1:03:44| This is an important decision. It's a really important decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| And regardless of whether or not you believe in the concerns that everybody else might have with the decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3828)|
| 1:03:55| we need to be willing to be at the table and argue about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| When I voted the other night in the affirmative for every particular reason that was lifted up in a motion is not because all those were my reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3839)|
| 1:04:06| They weren't my reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| The reason I voted affirmatively for those is because they were the honest reasons of other people on my board, other colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3848)|
| 1:04:15| And as a board, I've got to hear their concerns and say I'm going to give some weight to that because although it's not my concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3855)|
| 1:04:24| I understand it is your legitimate concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| And I think we need to do more of that as a board, and I'm speaking to myself too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| I've not always been willing to hear the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| And we need to do that because I will tell you our whole system outside of this decision with Knox Prep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| our system is Knox County Schools cannot be as good until the full elected voice is heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3881)|
| 1:04:48| And I don't just mean being able to speak. I know we can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| But that we're able to influence one another because I will tell you some of my ideas are good and some are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| And some of your ideas and some are good and some are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| And to the degree that we can influence one another, I fundamentally believe we'll get to better decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| And I will tell you for the next at least 12 plus months that I'm on this board, and if I decide to continue and successful at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3907)|
| 1:05:16| if it keeps splitting the same way, golly, it's going to be so disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| It's going to be so disappointing to feel like, and it's not about power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| It's not about getting a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| It's about really believing that the process is working and that we're able to have tough conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3927)|
| 1:05:34| and we're able to compromise and we're able to change each other's minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| We should be able to change each other's minds. That's not a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| So that's where I'll leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| Thank you, Madam Chair. And I appreciate you letting me take a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3946)|
| 1:05:54| I partially wish that I had gone before them so that they could clean up behind me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3954)|
| 1:06:01| because I'm not going to probably be as diplomatic as I would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3961)|
| 1:06:08| When we sign a tenure contract with an outside entity with no real deep and honest oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3968)|
| 1:06:21| I don't really feel that that is giving our students and our parents choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3981)|
| 1:06:28| And when we do that in a meeting where they have no opportunity to speak with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| they also don't have a voice. And that's what I want to talk about a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| This board generally has a longstanding practice of intentionality that we give to listening to board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4001)|
| 1:06:50| who represent impacted districts, even down to our agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4010)|
| 1:06:56| If it's an agenda item that is something for our district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| we make sure the person in that district is the one to make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4021)|
| 1:07:08| I remember very clearly being slapped by Ms. Detheridge in my first meeting because I had not made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4028)|
| 1:07:17| She snapped me right up. Not slapped, she just knocked me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4037)|
| 1:07:23| But those are ways of showing respect to each other's districts and respect to the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4043)|
| 1:07:35| we are communicating with our communities and that we understand the needs of our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4055)|
| 1:07:48| When we had recently parents in Hardin Valley had concerns about traffic issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4068)|
| 1:07:54| I asked to allow an additional month so we could hear more on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| Maybe we didn't want to spend another month hearing about more traffic issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| but we did it because that's what those parents needed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| We asked for additional information from administration, from the county, from parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4087)|
| 1:08:13| We heard from everyone who needed to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| In this process, I'm not seeing that same kind of respect being given to the parents, our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4097)|
| 1:08:24| the people in our districts. However, that's not where I have the greatest concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4104)|
| 1:08:31| My greatest concern is the disrespect being shown to the kids in our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| Because this board, with a stated mission to provide excellent and accessible learning opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4116)|
| 1:08:47| that empower all students to realize their full potential, is telling our kids in our districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4127)|
| 1:08:56| that we consider a school that scores in the 20th percentile to be an excellent opportunity for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4136)|
| 1:09:05| I can't imagine telling kids that this is what we consider to be the best we can give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4145)|
| 1:09:18| This isn't an excellent opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| And it's certainly not an excellent accessible opportunity when we're cutting out half our kids automatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4161)|
| 1:09:28| before the doors even open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| We've asked them questions about how they will treat certain students when they apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4172)|
| 1:09:38| And the answer has been, basically, we'll decide that when the time comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4178)|
| 1:09:44| I can't make a responsible decision based on someone telling me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| we're going to decide that later down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| That's something that we should be aware of on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| And the idea that we have talked about Title IX issues for months and months and months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4198)|
| 1:10:07| and now it suddenly doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| I don't understand the place where that's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4212)|
| 1:10:18| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| I just want to clarify that this vote, Mr. Dupler, because it's to deny the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| So if you vote yes, you're voting to deny the charter school, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4230)|
| 1:10:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| This one is a little backwards, I feel like, than it normally is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| Well, yes, and that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| But that's the feature of the state law because this board has to either approve or deny the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4241)|
| 1:10:48| So a yes vote would be for the resolution to deny at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| I'd like to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| We've discussed this for over nine hours, and I think it's time to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4256)|
| 1:11:03| So we have a motion to call the question by Ms. Henderson, a second by Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| Ms. Coatney, do you want to do a roll call on calling the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4269)|
| 1:11:21| So, well, now this is a call for the question vote, so it's not the vote I think you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4281)|
| 1:11:29| But when you vote on this resolution, a yes vote will be to deny the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4289)|
| 1:11:40| On the motion made by Ms. Henderson and seconded by Mr. Triplett to call for the question, Dr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4300)|
| 1:11:47| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| Ms. Byke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| Ms. Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| Mr. Triplett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4317)|
| 1:11:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| That's nine yes votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| All right, so that carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| So we are back to our vote on our original motion made by Reverend Butler and seconded by Ms. Owen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230427-charter-school-application?start=4325)|
