| 2:24:23| As I mentioned earlier, we really need to look more in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8663)|
| 2:24:33| We've got to do a better job of planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8673)|
| 2:24:35| And I guess my biggest complaint is I wish we would have done more planning on the front end of starting a new zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8675)|
| 2:24:42| Because it all comes back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8682)|
| 2:24:45| If you don't have a vision, you don't have a consensus in your community of what you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8685)|
| 2:24:51| you're going to have these conflicts come up routinely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8691)|
| 2:24:56| That's kind of beyond us now, but maybe we need to look forward to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8696)|
| 2:25:01| What Commissioner Schelso said about we really need to consolidate a lot of these tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8701)|
| 2:25:07| the only way to do that is increase the density to make it worthwhile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8707)|
| 2:25:13| Because a developer can't go in and build a three-story building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8713)|
| 2:25:17| and try to pick up four or five, six pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8717)|
| 2:25:20| It just doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8720)|
| 2:25:22| I think we see that with Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8722)|
| 2:25:25| Ten years ago, who would have thought that we'd see the values on Cumberland Avenue going up like they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8725)|
| 2:25:31| It's because of the height of the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8731)|
| 2:25:34| and they can get the density in there to make acquiring existing buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8734)|
| 2:25:40| knocking them down and going up with something more in keeping with what we want as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8740)|
| 2:25:46| For lack of a better plan, I'm going to make a motion that we amend the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8746)|
| 2:25:55| and follow what Commissioner Schelso has called the Schelso Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8755)|
| 2:26:01| Maybe it's a good start, and if it doesn't work, we go back and correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8761)|
| 2:26:08| Okay, so we have a motion to approve for Commissioner Schelso's map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8768)|
| 2:26:18| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8778)|
| 2:26:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8780)|
| 2:26:22| Second, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8782)|
| 2:26:24| We will continue our discussion with Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8784)|
| 2:26:28| I'm really sorry I didn't get to talk before you made that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8788)|
| 2:26:31| No, nothing's been decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8791)|
| 2:26:35| What I feel like Commissioner Schelso's proposal shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8795)|
| 2:26:41| A group practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| You have to say it real slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| Like a seashell, a shell, so, shell, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8805)|
| 2:26:50| Commissioner, that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8810)|
| 2:26:56| What I think that his proposal, I was going to say him, shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8816)|
| 2:27:01| is that we don't have these lines drawn correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8821)|
| 2:27:05| Because I know my first instinct, and I've picked this up from our original conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8825)|
| 2:27:11| when this came up at our first agenda review where we were talking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8831)|
| 2:27:15| and I picked it up during our workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8835)|
| 2:27:20| We all come from different parts of this geography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8840)|
| 2:27:24| and know different parts of it more intimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8844)|
| 2:27:28| And those are the parts that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| I come from the south area, and so I immediately respond to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8851)|
| 2:27:36| the Chapman Highway borders that are being drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8856)|
| 2:27:40| And when I saw the ordinance proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8860)|
| 2:27:44| and that it stopped at Young High Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8864)|
| 2:27:48| I thought, okay, I get that, that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| But then I keep thinking, and what about Colonial Village| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8871)|
| 2:27:55| and all of the walkability and node that is available there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8875)|
| 2:27:59| Why don't we push it that far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8879)|
| 2:28:01| And Shellso's plan doesn't push it that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8881)|
| 2:28:04| And then there's some other nodes beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| And people who are frowning now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| that's because you're probably not as familiar with it as I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8888)|
| 2:28:11| And I would have the same kind of frown on my face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8891)|
| 2:28:14| if we were talking about some of the other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| that Shellso has pointed out as extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8896)|
| 2:28:19| And what I think that's saying is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8899)|
| 2:28:22| we don't have these borders drawn perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8902)|
| 2:28:26| We're trying to amend those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8906)|
| 2:28:28| And when I think about when we try to amend those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8908)|
| 2:28:31| in this environment for other projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8911)|
| 2:28:35| somebody will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8915)|
| 2:28:37| we really shouldn't be doing that at this stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8917)|
| 2:28:39| We need to be doing this at a different point in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8919)|
| 2:28:43| And that's why I feel like the original longer corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8923)|
| 2:28:49| is the right thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8929)|
| 2:28:51| because Commissioner Midas makes the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8931)|
| 2:28:53| that that's where the community had their greatest input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8933)|
| 2:28:57| was the length of those corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8937)|
| 2:28:59| And that I would feel much more comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8939)|
| 2:29:02| rather than drawing the ordinance proposals boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8942)|
| 2:29:06| or Shellso's boundaries or any third permutation of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8946)|
| 2:29:11| I would rather have those longer corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8951)|
| 2:29:14| that are then brought to us as exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8954)|
| 2:29:18| You pointed, Chairman Hill, to two that have come up thus far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8958)|
| 2:29:22| that we needed to spot zone and affect in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8962)|
| 2:29:25| But that required us to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8965)|
| 2:29:27| very concentrated dialogue about these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8967)|
| 2:29:30| What is the circumstance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| What do we need to do there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8972)|
| 2:29:33| I would much prefer and feel much better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8973)|
| 2:29:35| about our responsibility to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| to do that at least for a longer period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8977)|
| 2:29:41| than we've been doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8981)|
| 2:29:43| and find out what we do have wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8983)|
| 2:29:45| and find out what we do have right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| than to make a blanket ordinance at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8987)|
| 2:29:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8992)|
| 2:29:54| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8994)|
| 2:29:56| I was just going to ask if we were to approve this hypothetically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8996)|
| 2:30:02| There was someone mentioned reviewing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9002)|
| 2:30:07| I don't remember who that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9007)|
| 2:30:08| but coming back to things like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9008)|
| 2:30:10| would there be any reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9010)|
| 2:30:14| or would it be appropriate to look at this again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9014)|
| 2:30:19| if it's approved in a year or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9019)|
| 2:30:25| review it and see, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| maybe that's too soon to actually know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9027)|
| 2:30:29| what the implications might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9029)|
| 2:30:31| But just in considering the development patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9031)|
| 2:30:35| and the thoughts around this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9035)|
| 2:30:38| I didn't know if maybe it would also be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9038)|
| 2:30:43| to review it later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9043)|
| 2:30:44| but just a thought out there if anybody likes that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9044)|
| 2:30:48| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9048)|
| 2:30:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9050)|
| 2:30:52| A lot of thoughts going through my mind right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9052)|
| 2:30:54| I'm trying to put them all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9054)|
| 2:30:57| We're sitting here talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9057)|
| 2:30:58| and what's going through my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9058)|
| 2:31:00| is the difference between urban and suburban development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9060)|
| 2:31:04| in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9064)|
| 2:31:07| I live in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9067)|
| 2:31:09| I can't walk anywhere for miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9069)|
| 2:31:12| I have to get in my car and drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9072)|
| 2:31:15| I think these areas that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9075)|
| 2:31:19| relaxing these standards because of vehicle traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9079)|
| 2:31:22| because of curb cuts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9082)|
| 2:31:25| because of the nature of our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9085)|
| 2:31:28| you can't get there unless you take a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9088)|
| 2:31:31| So I'm all for walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9091)|
| 2:31:33| but the difference between downtown and Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9093)|
| 2:31:39| and Chapman Highway and all that kind of stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9099)|
| 2:31:42| is it's not an urban area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9102)|
| 2:31:44| I would argue where the school is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9104)|
| 2:31:46| I know there's housing behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9106)|
| 2:31:50| but it's still a different type of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9110)|
| 2:31:53| So if I want to go to a restaurant on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9113)|
| 2:31:57| I have to drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9117)|
| 2:31:59| So I think while well-intentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9119)|
| 2:32:02| to reduce the vehicle traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9122)|
| 2:32:06| if that's what you're looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9126)|
| 2:32:08| reduce the ability to park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9128)|
| 2:32:10| it restricts people's ability to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9130)|
| 2:32:12| So I think we need to keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9132)|
| 2:32:15| A couple other things that I want to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9135)|
| 2:32:18| There is ways to develop suburban areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9138)|
| 2:32:23| that are walkable and livable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9143)|
| 2:32:25| And I think of Turkey Creek, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9145)|
| 2:32:28| I mean, it's highly traveled with vehicle traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9148)|
| 2:32:31| It has a lot of stores and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9151)|
| 2:32:33| that have parking in front of them between the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9153)|
| 2:32:36| but it also has sidewalks and trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9156)|
| 2:32:40| and all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9160)|
| 2:32:42| So literally, people living in the suburb behind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9162)|
| 2:32:44| can walk all up and down Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9164)|
| 2:32:46| They can ride their bicycles with relative safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9166)|
| 2:32:50| Pat brought up Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9170)|
| 2:32:53| I, as a citizen of this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9173)|
| 2:32:56| I think what we did to Cumberland Avenue is awful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9176)|
| 2:33:01| I think it's awful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9181)|
| 2:33:03| The plan that we sent to the city to do Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9183)|
| 2:33:05| is not what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9185)|
| 2:33:07| I think while well-intended, they wanted to make it walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9187)|
| 2:33:11| I would argue it was walkable anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| But what they've done is they've cut off businesses from traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9193)|
| 2:33:18| and the evidence of that is they're closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9198)|
| 2:33:21| I mean, one of our oldest restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| that I used to go in the cellar when I was in college is closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9203)|
| 2:33:29| And we're going to end up with a tunnel of tall buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9209)|
| 2:33:32| on either side of Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9212)|
| 2:33:34| It's literally going to be a tunnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9214)|
| 2:33:37| And I don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9217)|
| 2:33:39| So why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9219)|
| 2:33:41| I think it's a great idea that we focus on walkability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9221)|
| 2:33:45| and we focus on that, but we also have to keep in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9225)|
| 2:33:48| that the people that live out in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9228)|
| 2:33:51| have to drive to get anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9231)|
| 2:33:53| We have to drive to get downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| And I would argue that a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9235)|
| 2:33:57| we don't go downtown from the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9237)|
| 2:33:59| because it's such a pain in the butt to get down there and find a place to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9239)|
| 2:34:03| But I think this compromise is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9243)|
| 2:34:06| It's where we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9246)|
| 2:34:08| And recode is, I feel like, should be a living document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9248)|
| 2:34:12| because we should be able to sit here and discuss things like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9252)|
| 2:34:15| well, this was well-intentioned, but maybe we shouldn't have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9255)|
| 2:34:19| Maybe we should relook at what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9259)|
| 2:34:22| And that's just some thoughts that I'm having in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9262)|
| 2:34:27| And we talk about drive-thrusters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9267)|
| 2:34:30| There was an article in the paper about Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9270)|
| 2:34:33| about the traffic problem that they have because Starbucks is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9273)|
| 2:34:39| They can't get around people trying to get into Starbucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9279)|
| 2:34:42| There's not a turning lane. There's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9282)|
| 2:34:44| No way for them to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9284)|
| 2:34:46| While that was well-intended, well, everybody can walk to Starbucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9286)|
| 2:34:49| Well, everybody can't walk to Starbucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9289)|
| 2:34:52| But they back up every day, and it's a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9292)|
| 2:34:56| So those are just some thoughts I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9296)|
| 2:35:00| I feel like this is a compromise in things that we should be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9300)|
| 2:35:04| and I support doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9304)|
| 2:35:08| And I just wanted to clarify that the CG2 and CG3 zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9308)|
| 2:35:13| while they do allow very intense development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9313)|
| 2:35:16| that could be similar to a downtown type of situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9316)|
| 2:35:19| it doesn't require it to be that intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9319)|
| 2:35:22| So you're still going to have opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9322)|
| 2:35:25| for curb cuts on a major road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9325)|
| 2:35:28| And really, as Commissioner Hill or Chairman Hill has mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9328)|
| 2:35:32| the small lots are really the biggest problem in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9332)|
| 2:35:35| when you're having a hard time even finding a location for the curb cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9335)|
| 2:35:40| because you have to push it so far off to one side of your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9340)|
| 2:35:43| versus the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9343)|
| 2:35:45| And then you're bringing your building forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9345)|
| 2:35:47| That's really the biggest problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9347)|
| 2:35:49| Once you have properties with some width to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9349)|
| 2:35:52| there's really not as much of an issue with access and parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9352)|
| 2:35:55| and circulation around the property and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9355)|
| 2:35:58| It's really the small lots that are the toughest to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9358)|
| 2:36:01| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9361)|
| 2:36:03| Can I ask my chair a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9363)|
| 2:36:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9365)|
| 2:36:06| But, Mike, under the new code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9366)|
| 2:36:09| isn't there a no lot width in the commercial zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9369)|
| 2:36:13| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9373)|
| 2:36:15| I believe there's no minimum lot width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9375)|
| 2:36:18| It's been eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9378)|
| 2:36:20| It used to be, what, 50 feet or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9380)|
| 2:36:23| You know, I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9383)|
| 2:36:25| I don't recall there being one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9385)|
| 2:36:27| but I'm sure the neighborhood commercial zone may have had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9387)|
| 2:36:30| I'm not sure if C3 did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9390)|
| 2:36:32| Now we have none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9392)|
| 2:36:34| So it's like we're just exacerbating the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9394)|
| 2:36:39| Well, I think it's also getting to the point where you can have a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9399)|
| 2:36:42| cut up into maybe some zero lot line situations too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9402)|
| 2:36:47| I don't think it's really intended to allow somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9407)|
| 2:36:50| to create as small of a lot as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9410)|
| 2:36:52| and then scream and holler that they don't have great access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9412)|
| 2:36:55| I don't think that was the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9415)|
| 2:36:57| And also, I mean, think about the CG zone on North Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9417)|
| 2:37:01| you know, up by Central Street, like the downtown north area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9421)|
| 2:37:05| Part of that is zone, a type of downtown zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9425)|
| 2:37:08| but once you get beyond that, it is zone, CG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9428)|
| 2:37:12| and there are really small lots with buildings brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9432)|
| 2:37:15| towards the street that already meet the CG zone standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9435)|
| 2:37:20| We don't want to restrict somebody with a 20-foot-wide storefront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9440)|
| 2:37:24| from creating a lot just because we have a 50-foot-wide lot standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9444)|
| 2:37:29| So, I mean, that's really the intent of not having a minimum lot width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9449)|
| 2:37:33| is you're going to end up with small urban situations in some areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9453)|
| 2:37:39| You know, Kingston, like our major arterial corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9459)|
| 2:37:42| outside of the most urban part of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9462)|
| 2:37:45| that's where it really becomes different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9465)|
| 2:37:51| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9471)|
| 2:37:58| You all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9478)|
| 2:37:59| Are you getting ready to shoot a paintball again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9479)|
| 2:38:01| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9481)|
| 2:38:03| Sorry to cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9483)|
| 2:38:04| I didn't mean to cut in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9484)|
| 2:38:06| Go ahead, Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9486)|
| 2:38:09| Yeah, I, too, think it's more of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9489)|
| 2:38:12| all these things need to be more of a living-type document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9492)|
| 2:38:15| I mean, everybody, nothing's perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9495)|
| 2:38:17| No zoning is perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9497)|
| 2:38:18| No amendment is perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9498)|
| 2:38:20| You know, we just have to kind of flow with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9500)|
| 2:38:23| and see where the market takes us, as Commissioner Smith was saying earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9503)|
| 2:38:28| I do think the further we get out into the county, these things change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9508)|
| 2:38:32| The traffic patterns change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9512)|
| 2:38:34| The way we use our vehicles are much more traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9514)|
| 2:38:37| and car-dependent in further out versus, you know, downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9517)|
| 2:38:43| I know from personally developing commercial properties, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9523)|
| 2:38:47| with restaurants, you know, some with the curb cuts and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9527)|
| 2:38:53| and talking to the tenants, the guys that actually own the restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9533)|
| 2:38:56| you know, these are the guys that are trying to make a living out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9536)|
| 2:38:59| And people are funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9539)|
| 2:39:02| You know, when they're driving down the road, be it Kingston Pike or North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9542)|
| 2:39:05| or Chapman Highway or wherever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9545)|
| 2:39:08| they have a tendency to say, well, I'm hungry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| I want to grab some lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9550)|
| 2:39:11| I want to grab some dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9551)|
| 2:39:13| And if they drive by and they can't see the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9553)|
| 2:39:17| they hesitate in pulling in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9557)|
| 2:39:19| I don't know if you've ever had this experience, Commissioner, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9559)|
| 2:39:23| I have, you know, from tenants telling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9563)|
| 2:39:25| And even some that have larger parking lots in front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9565)|
| 2:39:29| and you can tell, oh, hey, they're busy, but I see there's some empty spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9569)|
| 2:39:33| I'll pull in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9573)|
| 2:39:34| Other ones have smaller parking lots that are full, and so they just keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9574)|
| 2:39:39| Now, there might be an alternative parking lot behind the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9579)|
| 2:39:42| which is the situation I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9582)|
| 2:39:44| And, you know, the tenants complain, hey, people just aren't coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9584)|
| 2:39:48| because they think we're too full or there's nowhere to park, they're in a hurry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9588)|
| 2:39:53| and they just keep going to the next place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9593)|
| 2:39:56| You know, so they bought big signs, you know, hey, parking behind the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9596)|
| 2:39:59| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9599)|
| 2:40:01| So, I mean, I think it's an unintended consequence because I'm big on walkable solutions too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9601)|
| 2:40:05| You know, we've got to have them together, truthfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9605)|
| 2:40:08| But I think the further we get out into the county, I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9608)|
| 2:40:13| some of those restrictions about how close you have to be to the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9613)|
| 2:40:16| and eliminating parking and drive-throughs and that type of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9616)|
| 2:40:21| should be considered to be eased up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9621)|
| 2:40:24| So I, too, feel like it should be more of a living document that we can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9624)|
| 2:40:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9630)|
| 2:40:31| Commissioner Wooten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9631)|
| 2:40:32| Vice Chair Wooten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9632)|
| 2:40:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9634)|
| 2:40:38| You know, anytime you create these new plans, just I've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9638)|
| 2:40:48| I started with the Planning Commission when I was 21 years old or 22 years old, 30 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9648)|
| 2:40:56| I had planning in my blood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9656)|
| 2:40:59| And, you know, there's a lot of things that just create unintended consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9659)|
| 2:41:04| and I think I've mentioned that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9664)|
| 2:41:06| And the way this town is developed, especially, as Karen said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9666)|
| 2:41:14| people tend to gravitate towards where they live and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9674)|
| 2:41:19| And I happen to live and work in the Bearden area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9679)|
| 2:41:24| spend a lot of time in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9684)|
| 2:41:26| And, you know, Knoxville, all the corridors are, a lot of the corridors are east-west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9686)|
| 2:41:32| We don't have a lot of north-south connectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9692)|
| 2:41:34| And like a grid system, like a northeast or in Texas or somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9694)|
| 2:41:41| where you have a bunch of cross streets that break up traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9701)|
| 2:41:43| where you can have more walkable patterns and those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9703)|
| 2:41:46| We're very linear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9706)|
| 2:41:50| Kingston Pike, for example, and Middlebrook and the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9710)|
| 2:41:53| you've got North Shore, you've got Morrell, you've got Ebenezer, you know, Peter's Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9713)|
| 2:41:59| and then you go all the way out to Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9719)|
| 2:42:02| And so what that does is it creates a ton of regional districts, not neighborhood districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9722)|
| 2:42:09| So I can see where you would have a Bearden district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9729)|
| 2:42:13| or a closer-in Chapman Highway district or a Fountain City district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9733)|
| 2:42:17| But to stretch those out, I think you do compromise those regional areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9737)|
| 2:42:22| that this town has created based on the way it's built roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9742)|
| 2:42:26| because of what our geographic constraints are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9746)|
| 2:42:32| So I think that the unintended consequence of what we came up with a couple years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9752)|
| 2:42:41| I think Director Brooks had a good start with the boundaries that she had proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9761)|
| 2:42:48| and I think we all agreed that that was a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9768)|
| 2:42:53| And then we would then roll up our sleeves and take the time to get granular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9773)|
| 2:42:57| in each of these areas to maybe move those boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9777)|
| 2:43:02| So I would be in favor of Director Brooks' original proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9782)|
| 2:43:08| or whoever the other staff person was that was tied to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9788)|
| 2:43:12| and then have some heavy lifting after that and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9792)|
| 2:43:19| Commissioner Schell, so would you consider amendment to your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9799)|
| 2:43:29| Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9809)|
| 2:43:31| Who did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9811)|
| 2:43:35| Commissioner Phillips, based on Vice Chair's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9815)|
| 2:43:40| Chris always has great comments and I don't necessarily disagree with him or agree with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9820)|
| 2:43:45| but I think at this point let's go with what the motion is and let's see if it fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9825)|
| 2:43:50| and if it does we'll go back and punt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9830)|
| 2:43:53| Can I say a few more things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9833)|
| 2:43:54| Sure, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9834)|
| 2:43:56| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9836)|
| 2:43:59| Because I wanted to just speak to a few of the comments that came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9839)|
| 2:44:07| Commissioner Huebner was talking about the county having different functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9847)|
| 2:44:13| and that it needs to be considered in a different fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9853)|
| 2:44:16| And far reaches of the county, I don't disagree with that, but correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9856)|
| 2:44:21| the two cases that we spot zoned were not in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9861)|
| 2:44:24| No, they were in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9864)|
| 2:44:25| They were in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9865)|
| 2:44:27| So we're not seeing the outcry of county saying, you know, this is not what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9867)|
| 2:44:33| This is preventing us from doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9873)|
| 2:44:35| Well, the county has a different code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| But in terms of these corridors, that's not what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9877)|
| 2:44:42| I think the intent from the former executive director was the more we got out of our donut of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9882)|
| 2:44:53| one, the traffic patterns, miles per hour are typically higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9893)|
| 2:44:58| And we're talking mainly these TDOT corridors about the things that we don't control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9898)|
| 2:45:05| And so based on those barriers, I think that's how she designed the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9905)|
| 2:45:11| And I just want to point out to you that there is a point where the zoning typically changes from CG zones to CH zones or CR zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9911)|
| 2:45:22| And so the further we go out from the city, typically it goes to a CH zone or CR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9922)|
| 2:45:30| And we're not dealing with the CG2 or CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9930)|
| 2:45:33| There's a few areas that we've, you know, talked about already that do still have the CG2 and CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9933)|
| 2:45:40| But as you had mentioned before, like, you know, why don't we extend this down further, down Chapman Highway, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9940)|
| 2:45:48| The areas that you talked about on Colonial Village, like those commercial areas are right now zone CH2, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9948)|
| 2:45:56| And that doesn't have a Build 2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9956)|
| 2:45:59| Now, granted, those could be rezoned potentially to CG2 or CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9959)|
| 2:46:04| And then the Build 2 zone, you know, could have been applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9964)|
| 2:46:08| But as of right now, the zoning, it really wouldn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9968)|
| 2:46:13| If we didn't change the Build 2 zone standard on Chapman Highway, for instance, the area around Colonial Village, it wouldn't change anything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9973)|
| 2:46:25| It's already zoned CH2, which the Build 2 zones don't apply anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9985)|
| 2:46:31| Currently, it's currently zoned CH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9991)|
| 2:46:36| Commissioner Roth talked about driving downtown, that he has to get in his car to drive to do anything because of his choice of home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=9996)|
| 2:46:48| And people come downtown so they can ditch their car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10008)|
| 2:46:56| It can be frustrating at times to try and find that parking spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10016)|
| 2:47:00| But they do so because they want to put their car somewhere and get out and move around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10020)|
| 2:47:05| And it's on a human scale, again, getting back to that, because that's what makes those things work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10025)|
| 2:47:12| But he complained about it, understandably, because it's different than what he is used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10032)|
| 2:47:19| What Commissioner Roth was talking about is what many people are so accustomed to doing, which is being able to just drive up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10039)|
| 2:47:27| There's a large parking lagoon and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10047)|
| 2:47:29| They don't have to look very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10049)|
| 2:47:31| They stash their car right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10051)|
| 2:47:33| They can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10053)|
| 2:47:34| They go inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10054)|
| 2:47:35| That is what our community is almost always accustomed to doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10055)|
| 2:47:39| And it's what Commissioner Huebner was talking about with the restaurants as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10059)|
| 2:47:43| Restauranteurs are used to having that kind of you can pull in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10063)|
| 2:47:47| People can see that my business is busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10067)|
| 2:47:50| And what the original recode was doing was saying we're going to try and do things differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10070)|
| 2:47:58| because the only time you can get people to do things differently is essentially if you say you're going to need to do this differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10078)|
| 2:48:05| No one is going to go let me just make things a little bit different or harder for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10085)|
| 2:48:10| And I don't even know if it's going to be that much harder, but it's just going to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10090)|
| 2:48:15| And that means that formulas that they used to rely on for making the project work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10095)|
| 2:48:21| or being confident that this is how their restaurant will get promoted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10101)|
| 2:48:25| all of those things get tweaked a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10105)|
| 2:48:28| So it's a little bit harder because it's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10108)|
| 2:48:31| And I think that that is what we have experienced to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10111)|
| 2:48:35| is that we're all trying to wrestle with doing things a little differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10115)|
| 2:48:40| but we haven't given them enough time to really figure out what's working and what's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10120)|
| 2:48:45| I appreciate you, Mike, saying Colonial Village wouldn't be included in this per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10125)|
| 2:48:50| but I still don't feel like we have the borders of this drawn correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10130)|
| 2:48:56| and I would rather spend more time coming back as this body or some other body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10136)|
| 2:49:01| to determine what those right borders are than to sign off on this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10141)|
| 2:49:06| and say we'll push up our sleeves in a year or two and come back and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10146)|
| 2:49:10| That is, I feel like, happy thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10150)|
| 2:49:19| because we're going to get busy with other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10159)|
| 2:49:21| We're not necessarily going to come back and deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10161)|
| 2:49:24| I think we can deal with it now, but this may not be the perfect structure for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10164)|
| 2:49:29| So I would advocate, if this motion doesn't pass, that we do come back to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10169)|
| 2:49:35| but let's spend more thoughtful time, not just push it down the road later in case it doesn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10175)|
| 2:49:41| You know, Karen, I wasn't completely off on what I was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10181)|
| 2:49:46| Sorry, she brought me up, so I'm going to rebut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10186)|
| 2:49:49| I'm not going to rebut. I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10189)|
| 2:49:52| But I think what we're doing here is we're looking at something that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10192)|
| 2:49:57| okay, maybe this compromise doesn't make it illegal for someone to develop their property on the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10197)|
| 2:50:06| or not have a drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| It's saying they have the opportunity to not in these particular areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10208)|
| 2:50:13| because it's maybe not such a great idea to force that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10213)|
| 2:50:17| They still can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10217)|
| 2:50:19| Sure they can, but they're not going to if it presents any kind of additional hurdle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10219)|
| 2:50:26| just because it's asking them to change their formula, change what they're used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10226)|
| 2:50:30| And that's what the current code does, is it says, we're going to provide this foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10230)|
| 2:50:38| that allows different types of development, encourages different types of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10238)|
| 2:50:46| so that we're starting to really have a foundation that is primed for more human-scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10246)|
| 2:50:52| pedestrian, bicyclist, all of that activity that makes for a more community-centered feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10252)|
| 2:51:00| And I would rather have that as the foundation and have people come in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10260)|
| 2:51:04| I've got hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10264)|
| 2:51:06| There's a giant rock where I have my property, and we need to consider this differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10266)|
| 2:51:11| than saying the exceptions are the people that still do what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10271)|
| 2:51:18| Because that's not how it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10278)|
| 2:51:22| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10282)|
| 2:51:25| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10285)|
| 2:51:28| Okay, I'm going to be fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10288)|
| 2:51:31| Thank you, Commissioner Adams, for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10291)|
| 2:51:33| Thank you, Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10293)|
| 2:51:34| I just had a couple things I wanted to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10294)|
| 2:51:38| Commissioner Roth, Turkey Creek is a prime example of an area that could be walkable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10298)|
| 2:51:44| but because there's such deep parking lots, I would say that it's too conducive for people parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10304)|
| 2:51:52| and it's too dangerous sometimes to leave that sidewalk and walk across that parking lot to access those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10312)|
| 2:52:01| I'd second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10321)|
| 2:52:03| I do see people walking and riding their bicycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10323)|
| 2:52:05| Do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10325)|
| 2:52:07| The other thing I would say about the Starbucks on Cumberland is both properties on either side of that Starbucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10327)|
| 2:52:13| are going to be redeveloped in the next year, and that Starbucks won't be there much longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10333)|
| 2:52:19| And people will have to walk into that Starbucks, and they're not going to be having to drive through on that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10339)|
| 2:52:26| While I agree I'm not crazy about what happened on Cumberland, I do think it's better than what we had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10346)|
| 2:52:34| And I think it's better for the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10354)|
| 2:52:36| I think it allowed for more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10356)|
| 2:52:38| And, you know, if we could get to that point, we all talk about needing housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10358)|
| 2:52:43| and that's what this ordinance allowed for, is allowed for that density along the corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10363)|
| 2:52:50| and for people who live on those corridors to leave their cars and be able to have a safe place to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10370)|
| 2:52:59| Anyway, I'll stop there. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10379)|
| 2:53:01| Thank you. Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10381)|
| 2:53:03| So, and if I understand correctly, you just said that it's important, and I agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10383)|
| 2:53:09| to have people that live in those communities have a safe place to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10389)|
| 2:53:12| And I think what I hear, and I think what I hear is that we're going to cut those off if other people can't get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10392)|
| 2:53:20| You know, we can isolate all of these different areas, and as far as getting into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10400)|
| 2:53:25| I'm running from thing to thing to thing to thing, and not literally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10405)|
| 2:53:30| I'm doing it in my car, because I have a great span of things I have to get to in the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10410)|
| 2:53:35| and I have life to live, and I have family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10415)|
| 2:53:38| And if I want to go to Fig, or Ironic, or the pharmacy, there's like six parking spaces for 12 shops there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10418)|
| 2:53:47| and I love that strip, and I'm just hyperbole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10427)|
| 2:53:50| But if I can't get in there to go get a present really fast for my friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10430)|
| 2:53:54| then I'm going to go somewhere else, because I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10434)|
| 2:53:57| I only have so much time, and I want all of Knoxville to flourish, Knox County, Knox City, and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10437)|
| 2:54:04| But when you talked about this being a foundation, this recode, I get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10444)|
| 2:54:08| but the problem is we have to deal with the foundation that's already present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10448)|
| 2:54:12| Right? This isn't a clean slate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10452)|
| 2:54:14| We have to deal with the businesses that are already there, and the owners that are already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10454)|
| 2:54:17| and they already have their livelihoods there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10457)|
| 2:54:19| And we're trying to meld all this together, but I think we have to do it in incremental ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10459)|
| 2:54:25| I think incremental ways are the way for change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10465)|
| 2:54:29| I am not big in the law or in business or in public sector for pendulums going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10469)|
| 2:54:37| What happens is we do better right here, and that's why I'm – that's where I stand on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10477)|
| 2:54:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10484)|
| 2:54:46| You know, I often walk and jog from Westtown Mall on Kingston Pike to Bearden and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10486)|
| 2:54:55| Well, more than half of it has no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10495)|
| 2:55:00| You get down toward Bearden, and the white stripe to the sidewalk is about three inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10500)|
| 2:55:05| So when you see these big F-250s and larger coming your way and their big mirrors hanging over the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10505)|
| 2:55:13| you know, those are barriers, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10513)|
| 2:55:15| I'm not saying we can't overcome these barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10515)|
| 2:55:17| I think walkable communities are the best communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10517)|
| 2:55:20| I'm all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10520)|
| 2:55:22| I think that they're best designed in nodes rather than big swaths of regions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10522)|
| 2:55:32| And I think the former executive director spent a lot of time well over a year looking at these boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10532)|
| 2:55:40| And, you know, we can – if this initial motion doesn't fail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10540)|
| 2:55:45| I would certainly support the one that the former executive director brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10545)|
| 2:55:49| because I can just think, you know, when you talk about North Shore Drive, that's like an airport strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10549)|
| 2:55:55| And there's so many varying directions of turning, and they're going to expand that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10555)|
| 2:56:00| It's not – get less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10560)|
| 2:56:02| And on that northern part, there's not even a crosswalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10562)|
| 2:56:05| You can't even cross North Shore Drive from the northern section of North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10565)|
| 2:56:11| So that's why I think that she has given a lot of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10571)|
| 2:56:15| I'm not saying that you haven't, Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10575)|
| 2:56:17| But if this – we do have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10577)|
| 2:56:20| Well, I see one more light here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10580)|
| 2:56:22| Commissioner Midas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10582)|
| 2:56:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10584)|
| 2:56:25| We do have a motion on the floor, and that is to – let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10585)|
| 2:56:31| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10591)|
| 2:56:32| It is to the Schelso Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10592)|
| 2:56:36| Okay, I don't need to repeat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10596)|
| 2:56:37| I think I've already stated it one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10597)|
| 2:56:40| So all in favor of the Schelso Amendment, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10600)|
| 2:56:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10605)|
| 2:56:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10607)|
| 2:56:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10609)|
| 2:56:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10610)|
| 2:56:51| Okay, so let's call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10611)|
| 2:56:54| I think the noes got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10614)|
| 2:56:55| You think the noes got it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10615)|
| 2:56:56| Everybody comfortable with the noes getting it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10616)|
| 2:56:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10617)|
| 2:56:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10618)|
| 2:56:59| So –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10619)|
| 2:57:00| Mr. Chair, I'd make a motion that we accept the recommendation of staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10620)|
| 2:57:05| with one exception on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10625)|
| 2:57:08| It would be west of Bearden Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10628)|
| 2:57:11| I would second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10631)|
| 2:57:14| I missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10634)|
| 2:57:15| West of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10635)|
| 2:57:16| West of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10636)|
| 2:57:17| Bearden Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10637)|
| 2:57:18| That's the road that runs in between Food City and the creek, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10638)|
| 2:57:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10644)|
| 2:57:25| Yeah, excuse me, CBS, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10645)|
| 2:57:27| Okay, go ahead, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10647)|
| 2:57:30| Mike, what's the part of Chapman Highway where it changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10650)|
| 2:57:38| Just south of where the commercial area is, like south of Young High Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10658)|
| 2:57:45| before it goes up the hill and it turns more residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10665)|
| 2:57:51| So you can see it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| Rhonda, so, yeah, it's a little bit further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10673)|
| 2:57:56| It'll turn to, keep on going a little bit south there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10676)|
| 2:58:01| Yeah, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10681)|
| 2:58:03| Give me the crossroad of where it changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10683)|
| 2:58:06| Can you zoom in on that intersection where the CG1 is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10686)|
| 2:58:10| Stone Road is basically where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10690)|
| 2:58:14| Quite honestly, if I can interject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10694)|
| 2:58:16| the city of Knoxville is building a multi-use trail on that side of Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10696)|
| 2:58:22| They have, you know, investing $2 million to do so, and it's under design now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10702)|
| 2:58:27| On Stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10707)|
| 2:58:29| Up to Stone Road, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10709)|
| 2:58:30| It's the, I remember this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10710)|
| 2:58:32| Yeah, a multimodal access grant, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10712)|
| 2:58:34| But if we, if I speak to Commissioner Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10714)|
| 2:58:39| and ask him to amend his motion to also make an inclusion of the Chapman Highway up to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10719)|
| 2:58:48| if Stone is where it changes, that doesn't change what the city is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10728)|
| 2:58:52| It just means that if there was ever any commercial there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10732)|
| 2:58:55| No, it wouldn't change what the city is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10735)|
| 2:58:58| They're providing that type of access, pedestrian access up that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10738)|
| 2:59:04| But just to confirm, that is where the furthest opportunity would be, which is Stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10744)|
| 2:59:12| Yeah, the current zoning in this area, that is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10752)|
| 2:59:16| I'd have to look to see if it extends any further down, but I don't think it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10756)|
| 2:59:20| Because the city extends all the way down the Governor John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10760)|
| 2:59:23| I'm pretty sure that's all CG, RCH zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10763)|
| 2:59:26| It's a huge gap between Stone Road and anything south where the commercial adds up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10766)|
| 2:59:32| So, Commissioner Phillips, would you entertain an amendment to your motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10772)|
| 2:59:37| to include alterations for Chapman Highway as well up to Stone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10777)|
| 2:59:48| No, let's go with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10788)|
| 2:59:51| We're going to be here all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10791)|
| 2:59:53| Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10793)|
| 2:59:56| When I put my revised plan together, I looked all the way down these corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10796)|
| 3:00:00| to see what additional properties were encompassed before we get to the CH areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10800)|
| 3:00:07| Another point I want to make here, the East Knoxville proposal that I put on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10807)|
| 3:00:12| does anyone here live in East Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10812)|
| 3:00:15| This is kind of to Karen's point earlier about when you don't know these areas intimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10815)|
| 3:00:20| we're trying to draw this boundary, and we're going to use Prosser Road now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10820)|
| 3:00:23| and TDOT's changing the entire intersection of Asheville Highway and Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10823)|
| 3:00:28| and that entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10828)|
| 3:00:32| But we could modify it a little later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10832)|
| 3:00:35| I did live in East Knoxville for nine years when I first moved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10835)|
| 3:00:39| That whole area is going to be changing and have some new plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10839)|
| 3:00:44| I'm going to vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10844)|
| 3:00:46| I think we're not drawing the lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10846)|
| 3:00:49| When I tried to change it a little bit, it was to encompass a few more CG2 or 3 properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10849)|
| 3:00:55| to encompass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10855)|
| 3:00:58| And I didn't even know about or recall this project for Multimodal Road down Chapman Highway as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10858)|
| 3:01:04| So I think we're jumping the gun here on drawing a line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10864)|
| 3:01:07| I'm going to vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10867)|
| 3:01:09| Appreciate your comments, and I appreciate the good input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10869)|
| 3:01:12| This is really good deliberation, good, healthy deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10872)|
| 3:01:16| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=10876)|
