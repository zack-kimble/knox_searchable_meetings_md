|   239.5 | 245.5 | So, first and foremost, thank you for giving me the time to be here to talk to you for a brief moment about CPACER.                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=239.5) |
|   245.5 | 250.5 | Whenever I stumbled upon this, it was geared more towards the blighted commercial property                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=245.5) |
|   250.5 | 255.5 | where we've had some issues coming up that we've noticed more than ever.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=250.5) |
|   255.5 | 259.5 | To my left is going to be the Deputy Trustee for the Knox County Trustee's Office, Robin Benton.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=255.5) |
|   259.5 | 261.5 | She's been here for some time.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=259.5) |
|   261.5 | 269.5 | Actually, Robin, you've been here for 39 years, and I applaud you, so I want to give you a brief round of applause.                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=261.5) |
|   269.5 | 271.5 | So, she started when she was 10.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=269.5) |
|   271.5 | 272.5 | She's probably going to hurt me.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=271.5) |
|   272.5 | 278.5 | Anyway, so one of the things that we've noticed going through our previous tax sales is we've started looking at the commercial property          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=272.5) |
|   278.5 | 284.5 | in every single one of your districts, and we went out and we've taken about 75 to 80 pictures of some of these commercial properties             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=278.5) |
|   284.5 | 287.5 | that we've sold, and nobody's doing anything with them.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=284.5) |
|   287.5 | 291.5 | And so we're trying to reach back out to see, you know, what's going on.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=287.5) |
|   291.5 | 292.5 | The taxes are being paid.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=291.5) |
|   292.5 | 294.5 | There's just no movement there.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=292.5) |
|   294.5 | 299.5 | And whenever we're starting to look into the direction that the county is going, I look at the City of Knoxville.                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=294.5) |
|   299.5 | 303.5 | So I've spoken with the City of Knoxville about some of the things that they do inside their area,                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=299.5) |
|   303.5 | 307.5 | and I was pleasantly surprised that they're also interested in Seapacer as well.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=303.5) |
|   307.5 | 310.5 | I had a long meeting with them.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=307.5) |
|   310.5 | 313.5 | Actually, last week, we talked about the benefits for the chamber.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=310.5) |
|   313.5 | 318.5 | We talked about the benefits for the city, for the county, and the direction that this could make us go.                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=313.5) |
|   318.5 | 325.5 | So, real quick, I just want to give you guys a quick listing of some of the things that you can actually look at that would qualify for Seapacer. | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=318.5) |
|   326.5 | 332.5 | Water irrigation, commercial refrigeration, permeable pavement, lighting, heating, cooling, windows,                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=326.5) |
|   332.5 | 336.5 | insulations, pumps and motors, solar panels.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=332.5) |
|   336.5 | 340.5 | We also have electric vehicle charging, flood protection, seismic upgrades.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=336.5) |
|   340.5 | 344.5 | That means since we're on the fault line, we do fall into this portion of the program.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=340.5) |
|   344.5 | 347.5 | That's the structure of the framing of the house.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=344.5) |
|   347.5 | 350.5 | Whether the beaming and things of that nature, that's what seismic upgrades is.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=347.5) |
|   350.5 | 355.5 | Stormwater, tornado shelters, roof, floors, doors, and also wind turbines.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=350.5) |
|   355.5 | 360.5 | The wind turbines, I don't foresee that being that big of an issue here in Knox County and the city of Knoxville,                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=355.5) |
|   360.5 | 364.5 | but those are the things that would fall underneath the Seapacer guidelines.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=360.5) |
|   364.5 | 372.5 | So, the next step was is we came to you guys last month, and I know you guys probably see a sense of urgency within me,                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=364.5) |
|   372.5 | 375.5 | and the reason being is because we are preparing the tax statements right now.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=372.5) |
|   375.5 | 379.5 | Tax statements are we're getting ready to ship off to the comptroller's office,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=375.5) |
|   379.5 | 382.5 | and then they'll send it back to us in the next upcoming couple of weeks,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=379.5) |
|   382.5 | 388.5 | and I'm going to put a Seapacer pamphlet in every single piece of commercial property if this is passed tonight,                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=382.5) |
|   388.5 | 393.5 | so that way we can let everybody know that owns commercial property that this is an option,                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=388.5) |
|   393.5 | 395.5 | that this is something that they can do.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=393.5) |
|   395.5 | 401.5 | So, right now we have a little over 228,000 parcels in Knox County.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=395.5) |
|   401.5 | 404.5 | We send out about 155,000 tax bills.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=401.5) |
|   404.5 | 409.5 | The rest are on mortgages, and we get those through CoreLogic and other areas,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=404.5) |
|   409.5 | 417.5 | but about right now we've got close to five-digit numbers that we're going to be sending out to commercial properties,                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=409.5) |
|   417.5 | 422.5 | and the direction this could take us, I mean, just alone in every single district,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=417.5) |
|   422.5 | 427.5 | I think everybody up here has some blotted property in their area.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=422.5) |
|   427.5 | 432.5 | Earlier today we were getting together a tax sell list, and I was noticing in every single district                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=427.5) |
|   432.5 | 436.5 | there's a lot of parcels of this go around in a lot of areas that could need help.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=432.5) |
|   436.5 | 438.5 | So I saw a need.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=436.5) |
|   438.5 | 440.5 | We started diving into it.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=438.5) |
|   440.5 | 447.5 | We started looking at the blotted portion of it, and then I've been contacted by some of the people in our area,                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=440.5) |
|   447.5 | 451.5 | and we actually found out that this also applies to new construction                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=447.5) |
|   451.5 | 457.5 | and some of the things that new construction could do with this and some of the benefits on that side as well.                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=451.5) |
|   457.5 | 460.5 | I've spoken with the great people from the chamber.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=457.5) |
|   460.5 | 465.5 | I've spoken with many developers around our area to see if they would be interested in it.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=460.5) |
|   465.5 | 467.5 | Once they were, I started talking to the banks.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=465.5) |
|   467.5 | 474.5 | If this is passed tonight, I'm actually going to hold a seminar in the small assembly room next month                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=467.5) |
|   474.5 | 476.5 | with all the banks.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=474.5) |
|   476.5 | 478.5 | The entire commission is more than welcome to come,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=476.5) |
|   478.5 | 482.5 | so I can talk about the advantages of financing through CPACER, through the banks,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=478.5) |
|   482.5 | 485.5 | and we'll just kind of go from there.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=482.5) |
|   485.5 | 491.5 | If you have any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them to the best of my ability.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=485.5) |
|   491.5 | 493.5 | Commissioner Schoonmaker.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=491.5) |
|   493.5 | 495.5 | Thank you, Madam Chair.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=493.5) |
|   495.5 | 500.5 | I just happened to notice something on the public chapter 138 that was included with the documents,                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=495.5) |
|   500.5 | 502.5 | and on page 8 it says,                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=500.5) |
|   502.5 | 511.5 | residential property consisting of four or fewer dwelling units does not qualify for financing under the CPACER program.                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=502.5) |
|   511.5 | 520.5 | So the assumption there is if the lot has four units or less, they don't qualify then.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=511.5) |
|   520.5 | 521.5 | Yes, sir.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=520.5) |
|   521.5 | 523.5 | I've actually talked about that.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=521.5) |
|   523.5 | 528.5 | We've talked through the city of Knoxville with KCDC.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=523.5) |
|   528.5 | 534.5 | It's Benjamin Bentley.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=528.5) |
|   534.5 | 536.5 | Benjamin Bentley through KCDC.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=534.5) |
|   536.5 | 539.5 | We were talking about the need for CPACER through that as well,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=536.5) |
|   539.5 | 542.5 | reaching that four and a half more units per acre.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=539.5) |
|   542.5 | 544.5 | I see that a lot in the city.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=542.5) |
|   544.5 | 551.5 | I don't necessarily see that as much in the county until we start getting into mixed-use development in specific pocket areas.                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=544.5) |
|   551.5 | 554.5 | That's my question, because it doesn't say per acre.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=551.5) |
|   554.5 | 565.5 | It just says residential property consisting of four or fewer dwelling units.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=554.5) |
|   565.5 | 571.5 | So I'm assuming if you have one lot with four condos on it, it doesn't work.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=565.5) |
|   571.5 | 572.5 | It's got to be five.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=571.5) |
|   572.5 | 578.5 | I can get you a more in-depth answer once we review the statute and things of that nature and let you know.                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=572.5) |
|   578.5 | 581.5 | I can call some of our partners throughout the state of Tennessee.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=578.5) |
|   581.5 | 585.5 | I can call Shelby or Davidson as well if you'd like for me to see where they're at on that.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=581.5) |
|   585.5 | 591.5 | Okay, yeah, because the state, I'm assuming that's not four per acre.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=585.5) |
