| 0:09:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| I wanted to let everybody know that West Hills Community Association is returning to their in-person meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| and will have their general meeting on Monday, October the 18th at 7 o'clock at the Church of the Nazarene on Benosdale Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=558)|
| 0:09:27| Also, it's my understanding that at some point in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| Council will be looking at providing some much-deserved bonuses for KPD and KFD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| and I was really hoping we'd be reviewing that tonight, but I look forward to that coming to Council soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| These bonuses are certainly an important piece of the puzzle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| but we also have to look at competitive pay so that we can deal with recruitment and retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Thank you, Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| Councilmember Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| Recently at a Council meeting, I suggested that we hold a workshop to receive updates regarding the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=596)|
| 0:10:06| that workers are facing at the new flyer plant that produces our electric buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=606)|
| 0:10:12| Instead, in lieu of a workshop, I thought it'd be best to get an update during my Council report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=612)|
| 0:10:19| So tonight, I've invited Kent Manant to share an update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=619)|
| 0:10:25| and I just wanted to state that although the City has executed an agreement with New Flyer to purchase up to 25 buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=625)|
| 0:10:35| we still have opportunities as a municipality committed to electrifying our bus fleet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| to ensure as we do so we are committing our dollars to the same principles of equity and justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| that we aim to commit to in our policies and practices in the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| Recently, Kent was awarded the CMAQ grant with the intended use of adding additional overhead charging infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=652)|
| 0:11:00| to our City so that we can continue electrifying our fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| And if I'm not mistaken, that RFP will be issued later next spring or summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| and then a contract will come to City Council for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| While we've previously partnered with New Flyer for these services, there are indeed other options in the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| local options, as well as other companies that have committed to their employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| and to the communities in which they work through legally binding community benefits agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| So at this time, I'd like to invite Kent Manant up to share an update with Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=693)|
| 0:11:41| Just before Mr. Manant comes up, Council Member Parker, this is an important topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=701)|
| 0:11:48| and maybe we should have it as an agenda item if you wish to add it so we have a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| so CAT can also be prepared to share information at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| I would like to bring an agenda item forward in a future meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| This would be information that CAT can certainly respond to at a future voting meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=722)|
| 0:12:09| but this is certainly an update that will give more context to the materials that have been shared with Council Members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=729)|
| 0:12:17| Okay. Well, Mr. Manant, if you could just keep it on the short side because our general practice is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| these are Council Member reports that tend to be a minute or two at most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| So please keep your comments short, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| I kind of prepared something here, but it shouldn't be any longer than a normal public comment if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=754)|
| 0:12:41| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| Well, good evening, Council Members. I'm Kent Manant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| I live at 311 West Glenwood Avenue, and thanks, Councilwoman Parker, for the opportunity to present tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| I have some little experience in this area of having sat on the Los Angeles County Electric Bus Coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| where we successfully got a commitment to electrify those buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| and the Community Benefits Agreement was a hugely important part of that, bringing labor and environmentalists together on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=784)|
| 0:13:11| So Community Benefits Agreement, let's talk a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| First, let's put out a definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| A Community Benefits Agreement is a legally enforceable agreement between a company and community stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=796)|
| 0:13:23| that, one, sets hiring goals for workers who experience barriers to manufacturing jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| namely women, African Americans, veterans, and formerly incarcerated individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| Two, it commits the company to developing a pre-apprenticeship program designed to train these populations for company careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=814)|
| 0:13:43| And three, it requires companies to remain neutral in any union organizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| Now, the Sierra Club and our environmental allies believe we can't build a new clean energy system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| using the same oppressive policies that drove the old dirty system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| We want our city to ensure that our new zero-emission transportation infrastructure lifts up the condition of the people who build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=838)|
| 0:14:06| In particular, the citizens of Anniston, Alabama, who have suffered contamination from cancer-causing chemicals from a Monsanto plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=846)|
| 0:14:14| earning the town the designation Toxic City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| They're an environmental justice community that also suffers from many of the region's general challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| poverty, low employment, low median incomes, racial and gender discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| Now, let's help them step beyond that shameful heritage while they help us move into our cleaner future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=868)|
| 0:14:35| Now, Knoxville is thoroughly justified in insisting that New Flyer guarantee their workers the tools for equity restoration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=875)|
| 0:14:42| just as we are moving to correct our own inequities and disenfranchisements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| This council has already had a presentation about some abuses at the New Flyer plant in Anniston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| and Knoxville sent down a contingent to do an inspection and address those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| Unfortunately, the inspection was not conducted in a professional manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| Particularly, workers were interviewed about working conditions and the presence of their supervisors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| so the conditions necessary for reliable answers were not met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| A CBA with the Anniston plant would effectively handle the situation by giving the workers themselves an effective tool to handle grievances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=911)|
| 0:15:19| And those workers are in need of such a tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| I sent you all the report from Alabama A&M University, which details challenges workers in the area face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=922)|
| 0:15:29| as they try to take advantage of the rapid growth in manufacturing jobs in the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| The Anniston plant is the only one of the New Flyer plants in North America to not have union representation for its workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=935)|
| 0:15:45| New Flyer's two other competitors, BYD and Proterra, both have signed CBAs, so there's ample precedent for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=945)|
| 0:15:53| Bringing a community benefits agreement to bear on bus electrification can also advance several of this administration's goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=953)|
| 0:16:00| namely securing living wage jobs, recruiting for marginalized communities to fill those jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=960)|
| 0:16:06| and establishing contractual requirements for local hires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| Even if those jobs will be in Anniston, the knowledge gained will be useful on our proposed stadium development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| securing the same goals for our own community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| Finally, it's fair to insist that companies receiving billions of public dollars in subsidies, tax credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| and procurement contracts make significant commitments to creating good jobs and community benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| wherever they manufacture their products and deliver their services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| So I asked City Council to create a resolution in favor of a community benefits agreement with New Flyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| The agreement should contain the elements in the example submitted, the resolution language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| which I believe Councilwoman Parker is submitting, and have provisions requiring a percentage of local hires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1007)|
| 0:16:54| Of course, the agreement can't be with a public body, but the Council could strongly urge that it be with the Alabama Coalition for Community Benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1014)|
| 0:17:02| The important point to remember is that workers and community members in Anniston tried to secure a CBA with New Flyer and were rebuffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1022)|
| 0:17:10| Instead of hearing them out and negotiating a real CBA, New Flyer hired a New York-based PR firm called the Transportation Diversity Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1030)|
| 0:17:19| which represents the interests of transportation and construction companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| TDC created a community benefits framework, which is essentially a public relations instrument without any teeth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| and certainly without any resource to boost the power and quality of life of the working people who are building our buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| Let's help those folks get the real community benefits agreement that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| Thanks for your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| Thank you, Kent, and thank you all for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1064)|
| 0:17:53| I know when other Council members have had presentations such as this, there's an opportunity for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1073)|
| 0:18:01| Councilmember Parker, as you may know, there's an item on our agenda tonight about this topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| and that comment would have been perfectly appropriate and timely to listen to as part of that discussion rather than a Council report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1086)|
| 0:18:14| So I think we can save questions on this topic for that agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| Councilmember Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| Well, I just wanted to clarify what Kent was speaking to tonight was not in opposition to the agenda item or in support of the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1100)|
| 0:18:30| This is more in response to our ongoing relationship with New Flyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| Thank you. Councilmember Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| This has been an item what's going on with New Flyer has been on my mind for, you know, since we first started voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| I think our first contract was two years ago, a year and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| And I feel like there are questions that have been raised about New Flyer, and we just continue to not answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1133)|
| 0:19:03| You know, I know that a group of people flew down there and did some communication, but it doesn't seem to be getting any better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1143)|
| 0:19:11| I would like to make a motion to postpone this item two weeks or until we have a workshop that we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| We're not on an agenda item right now, so maybe if 11E comes up and you wish to make that motion, that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| I will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| Any other councilmember reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| Seeing none, let's move on to item 8A, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| 8A is a resolution of the Council of the City of Knoxville electing Debbie Billings to serve as a member of the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1172)|

| 0:22:29| Thank you. I've had a lot of conversations about this item today in the last few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| I am very unhappy about the way we go about allocating the resources to these speed bumps, basically, is what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1356)|
| 0:22:47| This is something that communities or neighborhoods get together and there's a lot of work involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1367)|
| 0:22:54| They submit an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| They have to go door to door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| There's a lot of work and a lot of organization involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| I think the communities that have more resources, time is a resource, and organization skills, those are resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1382)|
| 0:23:11| The third district, we need a lot more help from the Neighborhood Empowerment to empower some of the homeowners associations that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1391)|
| 0:23:22| I know that we're on the list for so many, yet if the groups can't meet together as often due to limitation of resources, we get left behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1402)|
| 0:23:34| When we do the road repaving, we do that by district and we pay attention to almost to the tenth of a mile to make sure that we do it fairly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1414)|
| 0:23:45| yet we're not doing that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| There's certain neighborhoods that within a mile radius have 20 speed bumps and there are a few roads in the third district that I can't get anything on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1427)|
| 0:23:56| The third district has a lot of rural roads, but we are changing into an urban environment and they are dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1436)|
| 0:24:06| We need to get some work done on those and it feels like we just keep getting left behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| I don't want to vote against this item because I'm glad that people are getting what they need, but I am registering a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1452)|
| 0:24:21| Thank you, Councilmember Singh. I share your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| It is a challenging process that does require a lot of work by the neighbors who want it and consensus building, which is not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1466)|
| 0:24:35| I know I've looked into it as well, why this process is the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| Of course, it was to address some issues where traffic calming created a lot of dissent and disharmony in certain neighborhoods that got really acrimonious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1481)|
| 0:24:53| Previous administrations adopted this process that required more consensus building and that has introduced its own set of challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1493)|
| 0:25:03| I see what you are saying and appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| I would encourage you to work with Dr. Lomax and Debbie Sharp and try to help those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1508)|
| 0:25:16| One way to help the process and build consensus is you can have a very small segment where the amount of people you need to build consensus among could be 10 households instead of 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1516)|
| 0:25:29| Anyhow, maybe they can come up with some strategies because we do want to make sure that we get those out to neighborhoods who need it, even if their available time and resources are not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1529)|
| 0:25:40| I've gotten a good response. I talked with Engineering Mr. Cannon. I've talked to Office of Neighborhoods with Debbie Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1540)|
| 0:25:47| We already have a meeting set up in trying to help this along, but still there are a couple roads that are really dangerous that have just been neglected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1547)|
| 0:25:57| I asked for some money in the last budget and I know we don't have money for every single need that we have, but it just it doesn't feel good when the third district was the only one that wasn't on this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1557)|
| 0:26:09| Understood. Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| I just wanted to echo those concerns. It's something that stood out to me and I support having a more equitable process that ensures all of our districts get those investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1572)|
| 0:26:26| Thank you. Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1586)|

| 0:27:45| earlier, we just keep pushing this along. We cannot benefit some people by on the backs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1665)|

| 0:28:32| to, as a follow-up to some of the comments that were made during the previous presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| I was wondering if we could have Mr. Thorn, Isaac Thorn of CAT, come to the podium and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| answer a couple questions. Good evening. So can you elaborate on what the process was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1724)|
| 0:29:00| and what the visit was to the New Flyer factory? Yeah, we were there to do an inspection of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1740)|
| 0:29:08| the plant, look at other vehicles, find out what buses were there from other agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| We did have a chance to talk to employees. When we did ask them questions, we were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| in the presence of a supervisor. We made sure to do that when we asked those questions to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| make sure that supervisor was not around when we asked those questions. I've been to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| the New Flyer plants except from Anderson. I've had buses built there at a previous agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| I have not been to Anderson, but this is a very, very large facility. People are walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| around the plant. Employees are. They're working inside different vehicles. You have plenty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| of opportunities to ask questions to them when a supervisor is not around, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| what we did when we were there. I was not on that trip, but we had two staff members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| from CAT that got to talk to employees. So were you questioning them on the floor? Were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| you questioning them in private consultation? Yeah, we were questioning them on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| We did not pull them aside into a separate room to ask them questions because we didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| feel like that would have been an appropriate response unless we told New Flyer and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| supervisor, hey, we want to take this employee to a separate room and ask them questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| So in the course of just being there, we just stopped and asked questions to these employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| about their working conditions, what they thought about New Flyer, those sort of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1818)|

| 0:30:51| back. We certainly can provide that. I think he has it in writing and I think could provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| that, but again, wanting to make sure that if you do pursue some additional discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| on this, that we would want to make sure that that perspective was very well included in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| that overall dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| Mr. Thorne, is that a report that was shared with counsel? Do you remember when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| I would have been there September, late September last year or early October, and I do believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| that was a Zoom meeting, so it's probably the recording is still available as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| Okay. Can you, the motion on the floor is to postpone until November 2nd. How would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1880)|
| 0:31:28| a postponement affect the implementation of this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| Well, in this case, this is a contract amendment for infrastructure that's actually being installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| at Magnolia Facility. These are subcontractors of New Flyer that are actually installing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1898)|
| 0:31:44| the conduit. That's what this contract amendment is. This has nothing to do with buses being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| built in the plant in Henderson. This is actually work performed at Magnolia Facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1909)|
| 0:31:58| Okay. Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| Yes, I remember the discussion that we had earlier on this. In fact, because I'm very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| sensitive to the way workers are treated and whether they have union representation, et| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| cetera, I actually encouraged that earlier discussion. And I remember we had a fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1933)|
| 0:32:21| extensive and thorough discussion of that, and there was reports of what steps the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1941)|
| 0:32:28| had made to kind of vet this project, how the employees at that particular plant were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1948)|
| 0:32:36| treated, and I came away from that discussion, again, as being someone very sensitive to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1956)|
| 0:32:43| the way employees and trade union people are treated, basically with the conclusion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| it was no benefit to us to delay what we could proceed on with public transportation in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1970)|
| 0:32:59| If there had been tangible evidence otherwise, I would be arguing profusely to delay and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1979)|
| 0:33:08| look at another option. But unless something is presented to me that I haven't seen, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1988)|
| 0:33:18| don't have any reason, I think, to change my conclusion at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| Thank you, Council Member Parker and then Ryder. And remember, the discussion is on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2004)|
| 0:33:31| the postponement, not the contract itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| I did have a question for Director Thorne. I wanted to share the report from Alabama| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2018)|
| 0:33:48| A&M and the update from Kit Minow with my colleagues because we did have a report from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2028)|
| 0:33:58| our own internal investigation, which I just do not feel that you can investigate these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2038)|
| 0:34:06| issues on an open floor like that. That doesn't give the privacy and anonymity that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2046)|
| 0:34:13| workers are going to need to speak freely. In contrast, this is a report that does an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2053)|
| 0:34:21| investigation into the workers, and it involves 100 workers from New Flyer. And so I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2061)|
| 0:34:31| this would give us a more objective look at what is taking place at the plant. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2071)|
| 0:34:39| also included with that is a personal letter from two former employees and two current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| employees at the Aniston plant, just to confirm their details and share some of their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2085)|
| 0:34:51| personal stories and experiences. So, you know, part of what I was hoping to do was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| to bring you more evidence than what we previously presented. My intention, though, and I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2095)|
| 0:35:03| get to the question, was for as we move forward, I viewed what was on our agenda tonight as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2103)|
| 0:35:14| a contract that's currently in place. There have been some overruns. I didn't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| feel that this was the agenda item to try to hold New Flyer accountable on, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2120)|
| 0:35:28| since there's a subcontractor involved. One thing I didn't understand is somehow the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| I read it, it seemed as if the work, this was an emergency work order that has already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| Yeah. And so work has been completed. They're just getting approved for reimbursed for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2140)|
| 0:35:48| funds that they've spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| So that's one reason why I did not bring it up during this agenda item. I didn't feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| like it was necessarily appropriate with this contract that's currently in place, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| there will be future opportunities. There will be more buses. There will be more overhead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| charging stations that we will be investing in. And so I just feel like it's our due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| to continue to monitor this since we've already made such a, it's such a commitment and such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2168)|
| 0:36:15| a financial investment into New Flyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| Thank you. Council Member Parker, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| So to follow up on what Council Member Parker just brought up, the agenda item specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2184)|
| 0:36:31| here is not for buses. Correct, Mr. Thorne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| It is for the work that was needed to install the high voltage utility pole that is already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2196)|
| 0:36:45| in place to service and charge the buses that we already have gotten receipt of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| And so because they uncovered basement walls of an old building at the site, that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| this $47,000 increase is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| The work is done? Everything's exposed? Is it in operation? Are we charging the buses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2223)|
| 0:37:11| We are charging the buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| So this is just a bill we need to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| And by postponing the agenda item, because that's the priority motion that we're discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| we're just delaying paying the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| But we're not impacting any future buses or any past buses. We're just holding up on paying a bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2247)|
| 0:37:38| That is correct. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| Thank you, Council Member Ryder. Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| Thank you. In lieu of all of this information, I'd like to remove the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2264)|
| 0:37:51| But I do want to request more information on this and to look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| I think it's when people are telling us that there's a problem and we don't believe them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| we need to look into this more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| I just don't want to keep on moving forward, but I do want us to pay our bill today. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| Okay. Thank you, Council Member Singh. The motion to postpone has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| Council Member Thomas, do you still want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| Yes. Just in response to the comments that my colleagues Singh and Parker made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| any future contracts or present contracts that impact workers that the city is engaged in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2304)|
| 0:38:34| I would encourage those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| We need to be sensitive to how we spend our money and how it affects people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| And so I'm not at all trying to dampen your enthusiasm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| In fact, I will join you to scrutinize future and present contractual arrangements we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2330)|
| 0:38:57| as far as who we contract with and who the workforce is we're dealing with and how they're treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| So I just wanted to clarify that. It probably doesn't surprise you, but I thought I would add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| Vice Member Kennedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| Thank you, Mayor. Council Member Parker, thank you for providing this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| I've not had an opportunity to look at it, but I do want to ask a question as it relates to contracting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| that we do with entities outside of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| Do we have, is it our standard practice to investigate or to check maybe with the Better Business Bureau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2365)|
| 0:39:32| or with that city or state to see if there have been any types of discrimination charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| filed against that organization? And I don't know if I should direct that to Deputy Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| Director Thorne, do you, or David Brace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| Purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| Oh, okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| Penny Owens is in the back. She's our expert on procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| Ms. Owens, please share with us the due diligence that purchasing does on these kinds of contracts, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2393)|
| 0:40:01| Thanks. Penny Owens, purchasing agent for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| Now, to answer your question, we do not look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| We look at financial responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| We look, we of course look for their capability, their capacity to do the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| but currently we do not get into to look for any like EOC type allegations or violations or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2420)|
| 0:40:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| And so now, thank you, Ms. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| I'd like to now ask one of the law directors, what would it take for us to be able to add that step in the procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2435)|
| 0:40:49| Well, I think that you could inquire into a company's history as a part of the bidding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| There are certain state laws that limit the degree to which we can control the activity of others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2455)|
| 0:41:03| and limit the extent to which we have the capacity to require others to engage in certain activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2463)|
| 0:41:13| or certain degrees of performance to standards that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| The state law has dealt with a number of those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| and so it would depend specifically upon what you're requesting before we could determine whether we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2482)|
| 0:41:30| it would make a difference to ask for that material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| So we could not do independent due diligence to research a company that we are considering doing business with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| You can do whatever due diligence you choose to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| but at the same time, doing due diligence in an area where you're not allowed under state law to have an impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2508)|
| 0:41:56| seems like sort of a waste of time in doing due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| So state law, current Tennessee state law says that let's, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| if there is a company, this company in particular, that has multiple EOC complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2524)|
| 0:42:11| that maybe we cannot take that into consideration or we shouldn't be asking for that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2531)|
| 0:42:18| It doesn't say whether you should ask for that information one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| It does require you, the procurement laws that are adopted by the state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| in many cases do require you to accept bids to the lower bid in order to protect the taxpaying base of the citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2548)|
| 0:42:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| So I think what I hear you saying is that this cannot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| that particular question about whether or not there are some allegations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| even if they are found to be true against a company that we're considering doing business with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| that was discriminatory against employees, we cannot, we could not say no to that contract because of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2579)|
| 0:43:08| I would want to look specifically at what you're requesting and which contract we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| and which types of behaviors you're talking about before I answer that question because it does matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2594)|
| 0:43:21| But there are some that would not make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| We'll follow up with some email on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| Mr. Johnson, was there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| I know there was a postponement and then a withdrawal of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| Was there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| We had a main motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| We had a main motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| So the main motion is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| Is there any further question or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2628)|

| 0:43:53| Council Member Singh, just, you know, you mentioned having a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| Please work with Vice Mayor McKenzie to plan it and we will provide whatever administrative support we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2638)|
| 0:44:08| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| And maybe get some clarification from Mr. Swanson as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| Go ahead, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2655)|

| 0:45:28| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| Council members, just a couple preliminary comments before you begin this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| For those who may be wondering what this is about, a review of this preliminary plan for a planned development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| is a step toward allowing the multi-use stadium to be built at the proposed site in the Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2743)|
| 0:45:49| I support this project, and I support this preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| I would go so far as to say that the stadium concept is the perfect candidate for a planned development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| which is a process designed and intended to accommodate exceptions to land use standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2758)|
| 0:46:04| in order to allow for unique and complex projects that provide a public benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2764)|
| 0:46:11| A unique and complex project that provides a public benefit, that's what this stadium is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| That said, the decision tonight is only about land use at the site of the proposed stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| This is not a vote related to any funding agreements for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| This is not about the money, it's just about the site plan, land use at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| You're going to be asked to vote on those proposed agreements in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| Tonight's vote is independent of that future decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| Okay, so that's just a little bit of parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| We do have some people signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| First is Sandra Korbelik, Ms. Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| Please come to the podium, state your name and address for the record, and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2811)|
| 0:47:06| Sandra Korbelik, 5212 Daphne Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| Hello, and thank you for listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| I will not take five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| I'm going to ask a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| I'm not going to look for answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| I'm going to ask that you ask these questions as we go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| I'm going to refer specifically to Conditions 3 and 4 in the Staff and Planning Commission recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2844)|
| 0:47:34| If you don't have that in front of you, Condition 3 is referring to the sign plan, the lighting, and the landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2854)|
| 0:47:45| and simply says that it comes back for review with the final plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| My question to you is, that's not going to get you anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| because the code states that the Planning Commission can only vote yes or down, approve or disapprove, with the final PUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2876)|
| 0:48:07| That means you have no latitude except to agree with what the applicant and staff presents back to you for the final plan development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2887)|
| 0:48:19| and there is little or no public input at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| My question to you is, why would you want to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| It's taking away the power and the ability of the Public and Planning Commission to work together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2908)|
| 0:48:36| and I'm not even sure what City Council can do with the final plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| I can't find where it says that you can impose conditions or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| I think this is a real kind of bugaboo in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| No reflection on the proposal, no reflection on the abilities of everyone presenting, but a problem with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2930)|
| 0:49:00| I've worked in planning some time, and I've worked with plan developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| and I've really never quite seen this process before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| It's quite new to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| My second question and comment is Condition 4 in the Planning Commission staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2951)|
| 0:49:18| referring to the approval by the Special Events Committee for flickering and animated lights per event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2958)|
| 0:49:27| I looked up their responsibilities in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| I didn't see anything regarding lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| Their function primarily is to coordinate with the city and the applicant on the requirements to hold the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2974)|
| 0:49:43| There's no decision criteria for flickering animated lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| and there's, at this point, no ability for them to regulate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2988)|
| 0:49:55| My two questions are, one, Condition 3 is not going to get you anything, and it's going to put you in a box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=2995)|
| 0:50:03| and Condition 4, please make sure that the Special Events Committee does have that authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| and the public would like to see some decision criteria for that ability that you will give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3009)|
| 0:50:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| The next person signed up to speak to this item is Gary Lowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| Mr. Lowe, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| Thank you, Mayor and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| My name is Gary Lowe, P.O. Box 50444, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37950.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| I like baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| It reminds me of the time decades ago when we used to call it America's pastime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| Those were the good old days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| You know, I would like to see a stadium closer to Knoxville the way it used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| You know, driving 20 minutes away to Kodak is a bit of a drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3054)|
| 0:51:02| But hardworking Tennessee taxpayers ought not to be forced to pay for a ballpark to be used by a multimillionaire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3062)|
| 0:51:10| of a privately owned minor league baseball team, the Tennessee Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| The team owner, with his incredible wealth, could easily afford to build this stadium himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3075)|
| 0:51:21| You may know that that's the model today for building new stadiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| The four most recently built professional stadiums in California for professional NFL and MLS teams were self-funded by the team owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3085)|
| 0:51:37| That's the way we ought to do it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| Tennessee taxpayers have already shelled out money for two baseball stadiums for this very Knoxville AA team franchise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3100)|
| 0:51:48| And now taxpayers may again unwillingly build a third stadium for this team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3108)|
| 0:51:55| We taxpayers built the Knoxville Municipal Stadium for the city's minor league team in the 1950s, known as the municipal part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3115)|
| 0:52:03| And the name was later changed to Bill Meyer Stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| We spent a lot of time there watching baseball, the KJs, and then the Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| Then in the year 2000, taxpayers built a second one, $20 million cost, right up the interstate at exit 407.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3131)|
| 0:52:19| Now in 2021, taxpayers will be on the hook for $70 million plus for a ballpark for this same team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3139)|
| 0:52:27| Three taxpayer-funded stadiums for a minor league ball team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| Is this the function of government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| The cost and risk to local and state taxpayers for the proposed ballpark is too great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| The price tag for Knoxville, Knox County, and Tennessee taxpayers over 30 years with interest would be over $120 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3158)|
| 0:52:45| In the year 2002, how did a sure thing like the downtown Knoxville Convention Center project fail us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3165)|
| 0:52:52| in delivering the projected tourism numbers promised council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| Taxpayers continue to pay off millions in debt just a couple decades later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| So what are we not being told by those who are favoring this proposed stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| Of course, the economic impact study could give you enough cover for re-election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3186)|
| 0:53:13| but Knoxvillians are fed up with public spending on corporate welfare, giving our taxpayers to the ultra-wealthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3193)|
| 0:53:20| In reality, you're the government employees choosing winners and losers with our tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3200)|
| 0:53:26| and if you approve this ballpark resolution, that's exactly what you'll be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3206)|
| 0:53:32| The bond attorney advising you has shared pie-in-the-sky projections that paint a picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| designed to get you to buy into this corporate cronyism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| Check with the Winston-Salem, North Carolina taxpayers or their city government officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| and how their minor league team is working out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| Their team, named the Dash, defaulted on its stadium payments for rent this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| and the city was forced to cut the team's payments in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| It was either that, or they would have to start searching for a new ball club to pay the rent on the mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3236)|
| 0:54:03| Major League Baseball divested itself of 40 minor league baseball teams this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| and it took greater control of the clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| The sport just isn't as popular as it once was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| It's shrinking, and yet you're talking about spending our money on a brand-new stadium in the old city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3255)|
| 0:54:22| I don't think the college soccer players who will play for the soccer team in the proposed ballpark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3262)|
| 0:54:28| could bring in enough revenue to cover the ball team's mortgage or rent payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| This proposal before you for the Tennessee Smokies ought to be voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| It's too costly and risky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| Tennesseans in all 95 counties have already paid out $13.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| with Governor Lee's state grant gift to the team owner via the Sports Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| It's already costing us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| You may be thinking, well, I've not received an overwhelming number of calls or e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| from those who oppose this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| Well, all you have to do is go to the media websites, Channel 6, Channel 8, Channel 10, and see the backlash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3301)|
| 0:55:08| The opposition to this is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| So do a little more checking before you pull this resolution down the track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3314)|
| 0:55:24| You know, it's nice to rub elbows with the very rich in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3324)|
| 0:55:30| but for this time, think of your less wealthy constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| Do what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| Do they want this proposed stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| That concludes your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| I urge you to vote down this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| Next person signed up to speak to this agenda item is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| Ms. Feld, please come to the podium and state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| My name is Joyce Feld, 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3358)|
| 0:56:05| And I'm here as president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| And before I begin, there are two speakers here from Scenic Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| and we would like to request maybe two, possibly three, but I doubt it, extra minutes, if that's okay with council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3371)|
| 0:56:21| Mayor, I'd make a motion to give an extra two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| Okay, who's the other person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| Kevin Murray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| Yeah, well, he signed up too, so that's ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| So we'll see if you need it, and then we'll get going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| Kevin's not going to speak for five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| Oh, okay, you're giving each person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| You each are signed up, you each have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| Yes, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| I'm going to start this evening with some history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| In 2000, Knox County embarked on a novel initiative along with eight surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3409)|
| 0:56:56| Called Nine Counties, One Vision, three-quarters of a million people shared their vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| for the future of the region, and 9,000 ideas were generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| Unhappiness with sign clutter emerged as one of the two top concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| In 2001, a group of citizens with strong community support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| successfully advocated for a ban on new billboards in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3435)|
| 0:57:21| In 2008, another group of citizens, again with strong community support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3441)|
| 0:57:27| successfully advocated for a ban on digital billboards in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| In 2009, city council banned on-premise digital signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| grandfathered signs, of which there are a few left now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| must hold constant for 60 seconds, and flashing, scrolling, and animation is prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3460)|
| 0:57:46| In 2012, county commission banned digital billboards in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| and subjected on-premise digital signs to the same conditions listed above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| And finally, in 2015, after three and a half years of study and many hours of public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3477)|
| 0:58:04| city council enacted a new sign ordinance to reduce sign clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| I relate this history to you tonight because I would like both the applicant and this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| to understand that this community and its legislative bodies to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| have long demonstrated strong support for a beautified city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| free from unattractive and garish signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| None of the legislative actions I've cited here were taken quickly, easily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| or without extensive public feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| Against this backdrop, scenic Knoxville is alarmed by the many exceptions to the sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3518)|
| 0:58:44| that the applicant has requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| This includes, but is not limited to, the ability to use signs that are prohibited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| such as billboards, digital signs, animated signs, roof signs, portable signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3533)|
| 0:59:00| banners, and rotating signs, as well as the ability to exceed the height and size of signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| allowed in the base district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| Article 16.7 of the Knoxville Zoning Ordinance outlines the requirements for granting a planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3548)|
| 0:59:16| Section 16.7.3 states, and I quote from the ordinance here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3556)|
| 0:59:23| the underlying zoning district dimensional design and use regulations apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| unless an exception is granted as part of the planned development approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| To be granted such exceptions, the applicant must demonstrate superior design and enhanced amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3574)|
| 0:59:42| In no case, and this is the main point here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| in no case may an exception to district regulations be granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| unless the applicant demonstrates a substantial benefit to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| We commend the applicant for detailing the many public benefits that will derive from this development as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3596)|
| 1:00:03| However, the applicant has not described any public benefit as required by the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3603)|
| 1:00:11| that will be gained from not following the existing sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| So we ask, how will having billboards and animated digital signs make Knoxville a better place to live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3617)|
| 1:00:26| To be clear, we are only concerned with signage that's visible from the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| We know some of the signs will be used inside the stadium and we have no issue with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| as long as they cannot be seen from the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| We think the exterior stadium signage should recognize and respect the values and vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3640)|
| 1:00:48| the city of Knoxville has adopted over the last 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| We are requesting that there be limitations placed on the type and size of signs that will be visible from the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3652)|
| 1:00:59| We especially oppose billboards, digital signs, and digital animated signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| very large signs, and excessive signage in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| We also oppose revenue generating signs that advertise products or sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| Ms. Phil, that's your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| Oh, my time's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| Can I get just a few more seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Unfortunately, this preliminary plan has not provided any standards for how exceptions to the sign ordinance will be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3683)|
| 1:01:30| The applicant has frequently drawn comparisons with this project and the Parkview Field in Fort Wayne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3690)|
| 1:01:36| and that's the photograph that you have before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| and we're hoping that the applicant intends to use similar tasteful sign standards in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3698)|
| 1:01:44| Our preference is for council to impose restrictions tonight on some types of signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| such as billboards and digital signs visible from the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| At the least, we are asking council to require that the master sign plan come back to this body for review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3713)|
| 1:01:59| and public input before approval is finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| These actions fall under council's authority to approve the plan with conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3723)|
| 1:02:09| And finally, Scenic Knoxville will be happy to collaborate with the applicants on the development of their master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3729)|
| 1:02:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| Next person signed up to speak to this is Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| He's the last person who signed up to speak to this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| Mr. Murphy, if you could start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| I'm here representing Scenic Knoxville and also the Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| I'm not in opposition, just really with a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| Our major concerns are, well, first, I want to acknowledge and express appreciation to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3765)|
| 1:02:51| They've given a really comprehensive package, and that's what we need for the plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3771)|
| 1:02:57| We are excited about the plan development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| This lets us do things that aren't normally possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| Certainly, a stadium is not something that's written into the zoning codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| This is a good process for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| What our concern is for is, you know, KCPA and Scenic Knoxville is around, you know, the exceptions development requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3788)|
| 1:03:17| Joy spoke about signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| There's also a lot of exceptions to lighting standards and landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| And we acknowledge that right now it's, you know, we're early in, and it's impossible to know exactly with the precise exceptions that are needed, you know, at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3804)|
| 1:03:33| So, you know, hence, you know, why you'd request a number of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| But I think a lot of you have heard that old adage of, you know, trust but verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| We have a lot of trust for the designers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| I know many of them, they are really well respected in the community and do wonderful work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| And we have a lot of trust for the staff as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| But given the substantial exceptions requested, we think a verification step is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3830)|
| 1:03:56| And that also allows you as the legislative body to kind of take on the brunt of any, you know, any really tough decisions that may come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3836)|
| 1:04:06| and maybe tougher for staff to handle on the lighting and the landscaping plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| So, you know, we'd suggest that you add a condition for that the lighting and landscaping plans come back to city council for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3851)|
| 1:04:19| You know, it could be something similar to the special use approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| I know there's concern about that slowing things down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| You know, those really could probably come, you know, the same, you know, back through with the final plan application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| But special use approvals give you the ability to make modifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| Mary English wrote a letter on behalf of the League of Women Voters, and she didn't sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| I think she was asking if she could take the balance of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| We don't typically share, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| I'll ask for two minutes for Miss English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| Miss English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| Council members like to hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| Is there any objection to Miss English having two or three minutes to speak about a letter that you received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3901)|
| 1:05:10| We can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| All those in favor of granting her that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| Any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3914)|
| 1:05:15| Please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| Any opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| Miss English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| What I want to do is just cut to the chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| You all have the letter, and I don't know whether you had time to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| But one of the key things in the code, I was part of the recode process, the stakeholder advisory committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3928)|
| 1:05:37| and we went through a lot of stuff on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| So one of the key things here is that according to Article Section 16.7E3E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3941)|
| 1:05:52| there are six approval standards that need to be applied at the preliminary plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3952)|
| 1:06:01| And three of them are not able to be applied at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3961)|
| 1:06:07| Those three are the second one, which is proposed plan development will not be injurious to the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3967)|
| 1:06:15| and enjoyment of other property in the vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| The third one standard is the proposed plan development will not impede the normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3979)|
| 1:06:27| and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3987)|
| 1:06:34| And then the big one is the sixth one, which says that the location and arrangement of structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=3994)|
| 1:06:42| parking areas, walks, landscape, lighting, and other site elements are compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4002)|
| 1:06:50| with the surrounding neighborhood and adjacent uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4010)|
| 1:06:56| So in order to properly say yes to that standard, you need to know what the plans are for the lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4016)|
| 1:07:10| for the signage, for the landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| Otherwise, how can you say yes on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4033)|
| 1:07:19| So I'll leave you with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4039)|
| 1:07:26| Ms. English, if you could just give, for the record, your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4050)|
| 1:07:31| Please, your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4053)|
| 1:07:34| 810 Oak Grove Lane, 37919 in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| Council members, that concludes public forum on Item 11G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| Oh, I didn't see yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| You know, I guess I'll start by saying that Knoxville's made a lot of progress with regard to sign clutter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| and certainly I totally understand why these questions are being brought this evening about this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4083)|
| 1:08:11| I share concerns about what we're going to be seeing from landscape, what we're going to be seeing from lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4091)|
| 1:08:17| and obviously in the master sign proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| So in looking at this, what I wanted to do first was ask Mr. Frost some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4101)|
| 1:08:28| It seemed to me like procedurally there's been a lot of questions tonight about whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| or not council will be able to ultimately review anything regarding these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4113)|
| 1:08:39| And so specifically my question is, if there's a process in place where, if appealed, the landscape plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4119)|
| 1:08:46| the master sign plan, and the lighting plan could be appealed and heard by council at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4126)|
| 1:08:52| Council Member Roberto, yes, that is correct, and I'm happy to go into greater detail if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4132)|
| 1:08:59| If you would, please let us know how this would come to council for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| Well, first, let's, Master Signage Plans for Unified Developments, which this is, is Article 13.7 of RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4144)|
| 1:09:12| A master signage plan is submitted to planning as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| Commission may approve, modify, or deny the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4158)|
| 1:09:25| Sign, depending on what staff does, the master sign plan can be appealed to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4165)|
| 1:09:32| and it can be later appealed to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| The exterior lighting plan would be appealable to the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4176)|
| 1:09:45| and depending on the outcome there, it could be appealed to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4185)|
| 1:09:52| The landscape plan is required because it's a plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4192)|
| 1:09:59| The landscape plan actually must be approved before the building permits for the project can be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4199)|
| 1:10:08| A landscaping plan can be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| and depending on the outcome there, it can be appealed to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4214)|
| 1:10:21| I've reviewed the process that's been put in place in RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4221)|
| 1:10:27| In RECODE, as codified, there's a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| It's a process for review and potential appeal if a party is not happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4232)|
| 1:10:39| As a lawyer, I would caution a client, in this case the members of city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4239)|
| 1:10:46| to condition approval of a plan that is contrary to the law that has already been passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4246)|
| 1:10:56| Some might say, well, I might say that it has the potential issue of changing the rules in the middle of the game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4256)|
| 1:11:03| and people need some certainty when they come and there's a process in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4263)|
| 1:11:12| No one is saying that these matters will not ever get back to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| They may simply be appealed and go through the process that is already in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| and a process that has been familiar with a lot of members of the community for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4283)|
| 1:11:30| So, Mr. Frost, just following up, if council was to approve this agenda item this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4290)|
| 1:11:40| and there was something that was objectionable by community standards here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4300)|
| 1:11:49| with regard to the landscape plan, the sign plan, or the lighting plan, there would be options to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4309)|
| 1:11:57| And those options to appeal would ultimately, if they were appealed all the way, end up with council making a final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4317)|
| 1:12:04| And then if someone was unhappy with the decision made by council, they could be appealed to Knox County Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4324)|
| 1:12:11| That answers my question. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| Thank you, Councilman Roberto. Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4334)|
| 1:12:25| I'm also trying to gain a better understanding of the process involved in a plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4345)|
| 1:12:34| I'm just now starting to get familiar with it, so I'm not an expert on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| But what concerns me about this process is that, and please correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4358)|
| 1:12:51| I don't know who I'm directing that to, perhaps Rob Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4371)|
| 1:12:57| One role that council members often play in these issues involving zoning is to help negotiate on the front end before a final plan comes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4377)|
| 1:13:17| And it seems like from what I'm hearing is that if we approve this tonight, it would not come back before us unless there's an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4397)|
| 1:13:29| There's no opportunity to influence this plan before an appeal would be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4409)|
| 1:13:36| Well, yes and no, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| The developer, I don't know what they're going to submit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| The developer could submit something that is objectionable to the planning commission or the zoning administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4423)|
| 1:13:49| The developer could then have the option to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| But there's also a chance that the developer, you know, they're going to be submitting at least, you know, we're talking three plans tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4433)|
| 1:14:01| that the plans they submit might not be objectionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| And if a plan is not objectionable, I question why would you want to condition they have to come back to city council for something that has been through a process where no objection has been raised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4445)|
| 1:14:25| Well, I don't know if you're opposing that question to me or not, but it helps me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| It's rhetorical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| But I mean, I guess the question about if you would condition, first I have a, there's something in the back of my legal mind triggering you have rules in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4471)|
| 1:14:43| Be careful if you change them midstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| And then even if, you know, I don't vote anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| I was term limited from city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| You all make those decisions yourselves now and you all do a fine job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| But if you do decide to place a condition, you know, thinking about, you know, is potentially delaying something that has sailed through because there is no objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4497)|
| 1:15:11| is that something that you all would want to do as legislators?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4511)|
| 1:15:21| Well, I appreciate that thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| What I'm struggling with is, you know, it makes me think of the discussion we just went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4524)|
| 1:15:34| Because the not so transit authority, transportation authority does not have purchasing power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4534)|
| 1:15:40| So many of those decisions come before city council for us to approve and then we can engage in some really important conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4540)|
| 1:15:49| The sports authority has purchasing power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| And now we are discussing potentially reducing our oversight role in terms of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4554)|
| 1:16:01| Or are you arguing that we are not discussing limiting our role but this is the, we will continue in the oversight role that we've always built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4561)|
| 1:16:12| My belief is that the recode process is the process that this process has begun with, the development has begun with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4572)|
| 1:16:23| So those are the parameters that are given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| You know, if you disagree with the rules, that's your right and you can vote accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4588)|
| 1:16:37| But you can also try to start the process up to say, I don't like how plan developments are going right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4597)|
| 1:16:45| I think city council should have some more oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| We would prepare a resolution assuming it passed city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| It would go to planning to look at, does this process, this element of recode need to be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| And planning would report back to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| And then, you know, perhaps a change in the process would be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| But for this particular project, the ground rules are in place, I'd respectfully submit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4627)|
| 1:17:15| You know, based on your comments, it actually makes me more committed to making the change now before delving further into this plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4635)|
| 1:17:29| You know, obviously we're going to learn a lot following recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| We've learned that with, you know, certain commercial developments, we need better design standards in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4653)|
| 1:17:42| So we put a moratorium there until we could get those design standards in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| If we are learning something through this process, through this proposal, that we need to, you know, perhaps consider some of the recommendations that were made for us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4667)|
| 1:18:01| I think that it's actually a better time for us to do that before we get too far along into what could be argued is the biggest plan development process that we've had to consider thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4681)|
| 1:18:19| Thank you, Councilmember Parker, Councilmember Fugitt, and then Ryder, and then Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4699)|
| 1:18:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| First of all, I'll just go on record that I am absolutely 100% opposed to revisiting, putting a moratorium on planned developments for this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4707)|
| 1:18:40| It is not fair to people who have already begun a project to all of a sudden say everything that you've been talked about, known to be the rules, we're just going to put a moratorium on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4720)|
| 1:18:54| That, in effect, kills the state. Let's just be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| So, Mr. Frost, when the question was asked of Councilwoman Parker, do we have a role to play if not officially, correct me if I'm wrong, but I would say that we have the role that we always have as members of the community and elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4739)|
| 1:19:21| We can attend public meetings. We can listen. We can talk to people involved and share with them our concerns about plans that come before us. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4761)|
| 1:19:36| Yes, that's correct, Councilmember Fugitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| There are some decisions that do get made without the input of City Council. For example, not all decisions of the Board of Zoning Appeals reach City Council. They only get to City Council if and when they are appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4778)|
| 1:19:55| I've seen some decisions at VZA many, many years ago that I personally didn't agree with. Nobody appealed. Never got to City Council while I served on City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4795)|
| 1:20:07| So, the City Council does have oversight in many, many regards. City Council oversight would come into play in this situation if the developer submitted any of these three plans that were objectionable and citizens or organizations who felt they were out of place could appeal them and the appeal process could begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4807)|
| 1:20:37| And reach City Council and potentially reach Box County Chancellery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4837)|
| 1:20:44| May I ask a follow-up on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| Please, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| So, if we were, in theory, to change the rules in the middle of this, at some point, could the developer go to Chancellery Court about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4847)|
| 1:20:59| You can get to the Court on anything, obviously. But, you know, that would be an option. And if there were five or more votes to do that, I'd be down there defending the majority of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4859)|
| 1:21:13| Thank you. I just thought I'd ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| Thank you, Council Member Fugate. Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| Okay. Well, I have a couple of questions. And I'll start with, I think Mr. Johnson might be accommodating the requests I had. Maybe he'll give me a thumbs up. We'll give him a moment and I'll tell you what he's putting up. I'll give some precursor comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4879)|
| 1:21:37| So, the issue that's on the discussion about what we have right now is we have a law on the books of how we receive a plan and how we deliberate that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4897)|
| 1:21:51| And this is the graphic. This is our adopted law. And I think what we're discussing right now is do we decide to ignore the laws that we adopted that we publicly vetted and do something different because we have decided, you know, someone decides they don't like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4911)|
| 1:22:10| And the issue is I don't see how we can do that because, you know, we're just throwing it out and saying to any developer or anybody that wants to apply for something, we decided we didn't like it in the midst of a deliberation, so let's change the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4930)|
| 1:22:27| This flowchart is exactly the process that's going on, whether we like it or not. And if we don't like it, then the process is to work with the Planning Commission to do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4947)|
| 1:22:36| But they've made their, they've had their pre-application conference, which is the top bubble. And then there was the presentation at the Planning Commission where it was voted on, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4956)|
| 1:22:50| Ms. Brooks, is that correct? We're now down at the middle circles in the flowchart. This is 16.7 Section G in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4970)|
| 1:23:00| Yes, that is correct, Councilmember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| So it was voted on at the Planning Commission and it was, there was the public hearing and the three options were to recommend from the Planning Commission staff to recommend denial of approval or recommend approval with conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4984)|
| 1:23:19| It was passed at the Planning Commission and then it came to us. This is now our public hearing where we take an action. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=4999)|
| 1:23:30| We're in the oval circle down below. Yes, there we are. We have our three choices here tonight and those are our three choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5010)|
| 1:23:39| And then it goes on, just to make sure I am understanding this correctly because we have not done very many of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5019)|
| 1:23:46| Then it goes on, if we approve it or we approve it with conditions, then they will submit their final plan to the Planning Commission that will be voted on by the commissioners. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5026)|
| 1:23:58| Is it voted on by the Planning Commission? It is. In a public hearing and process, it's not decided by staff? That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5038)|
| 1:24:05| A Master Sign Plan is also publicly heard and voted on by the Planning Commission commissioners, not by staff? That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5045)|
| 1:24:20| I just thought it was really important that everybody see it visually as an educator. Visual is really important because that was what we were discussing and debating at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5060)|
| 1:24:34| I want to slightly shift gears before I leave the mic to somebody else for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5074)|
| 1:24:41| I will say to the stadium and the designers and everything, I was very fringely and not highly involved when the sign code was decided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5081)|
| 1:24:55| but digital billboards and moving signs were not adopted and were killed a long time ago in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5095)|
| 1:25:06| We don't do those in the city of Knoxville. I have a lot of business constituents that want variances and changes to the sign code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5106)|
| 1:25:15| That is where I have some hesitation and qualms as to why a particular project would get leeway to the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5115)|
| 1:25:25| when some of our small, locally owned businesses are not getting leeway to that code. That's my comment on signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5125)|
| 1:25:33| I just wanted to comment and have this, and I appreciate Mr. Johnson and Ms. Maupin for making it possible to put this flowchart up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5133)|
| 1:25:40| If anybody wants to look it up, it is in. Just Google Knoxville Muni Code 16.7G, and that's the process we're discussing and going through at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5140)|
| 1:25:50| Thank you, Council Member Ryder. Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| Thank you, Mayor. This is a new process for this body, but for anybody, so I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5154)|
| 1:26:01| Plan development was created so that unusual projects can be built that our zoning code doesn't allow for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5161)|
| 1:26:08| so it just so happens this happens to be a special one as our first one, or I should say our second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5168)|
| 1:26:14| I have a few things to say, but before I do, there was an issue brought up by Ms. Korbel a few minutes ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5174)|
| 1:26:20| related to the authority of special events as it relates to processes and approvals for special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5180)|
| 1:26:28| Can somebody weigh in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| Ms. Welch, could you speak to that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| Yes, thanks so much, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| I'm actually going to ask my colleague, Rebecca Jane Justice, to come up to the podium if that's okay, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5196)|
| 1:26:42| She has become the resident expert on our approval process through special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5202)|
| 1:26:53| Can you repeat the specific question that you had, Councilman Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| I must admit I didn't take a very good note, but I do remember I had a similar question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| There was reference to special events having authority or not having sufficient authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5221)|
| 1:27:07| as it relates to maybe lighting or access to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5227)|
| 1:27:13| Right, so I think the concern that was brought up was towards the exceptions for special effect lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5233)|
| 1:27:23| or maybe that includes fireworks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| The Office of Special Events usually does not, not usually, they do not permit special effect lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5247)|
| 1:27:35| They permit events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| So after they permit an event, the event holder will then go through the procurement process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5257)|
| 1:27:45| of hiring a professional that will follow any permitting in the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5265)|
| 1:27:51| that adheres to safety standards for the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5271)|
| 1:27:57| So that being said, this situation with the stadium, we will have, as part of the lease agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5277)|
| 1:28:06| we will agree to allow, I'm trying to say this clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5286)|
| 1:28:12| we will agree to allow that process to go through special events according to the zoning specifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5292)|
| 1:28:21| with hiring a consultant that follows the specific parameters in that zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5301)|
| 1:28:29| Does that make, is that clear, or did I muddy it even more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| We're going to lay out some requirements in the lease around special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| And when, you know, just like with other special events in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| and you may, some of you may attend those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| there are sometimes lighting features or fireworks features to events that happen in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| So we will be addressing that through the lease agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5330)|
| 1:28:54| because we realize that these events will be happening on a more frequent occurrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| So we need to make sure that, just like other special events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5339)|
| 1:29:04| because there will be a lot of them at this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| that they're following that process that we use for our traditional special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5346)|
| 1:29:13| There's just going to be a little bit more volume of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| so we're going to have to address that in the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| Okay, just one follow-on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5358)|
| 1:29:19| For that item and similar ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| who will have ultimate approval authority of the lease agreement associated with this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| That will be the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| The sports authority will approve the lease agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| but just as a reminder, that lease agreement will be available to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5369)|
| 1:29:36| when you approve the interlocal agreement between the city, the county, and the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5376)|
| 1:29:42| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5382)|
| 1:29:43| But the sports authority has the authority to approve that lease agreement at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| That was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| So tonight, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| we requested to consider the tradeoff between deviations from the zoning code that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| in exchange for public benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| That's part of the consideration this body has to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| because this doesn't fit into our zoning code, which is why it was created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| and which is why community benefits are required as part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| So I just wanted to clarify that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| I agree with a lot of the concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| particularly brought up by members of Scenic Knoxville and some of my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5419)|
| 1:30:23| that there's been great pride over decades in a lot of the sign ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| particularly in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| and it's created a wonderful place to be and something that we all kind of hold hard and fast to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5430)|
| 1:30:37| So although these deviations are important to consider as a tradeoff for community benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5437)|
| 1:30:43| those longstanding sign ordinances are extremely critical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5443)|
| 1:30:48| and I would encourage the developer in this situation to honor those as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| Obviously, I don't assume that this was presented willy-nilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| It's already gone through multiple bodies before it got here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| and I also think that there's room for improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| or consideration of the concerns raised not only tonight but at the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| So I would encourage, regardless of the decision tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| that the applicant meet with members of Scenic Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| and I mention them because they spoke tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| but also because they've advocated for these things and understand tradeoffs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| not necessarily with a lot of sports stadiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| but generally speaking, there are ways to get creative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| and particularly related to lighting that faces public right-of-ways I think is extremely important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5487)|
| 1:31:32| at least to me, and I know having lived downtown, that's really important as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5492)|
| 1:31:38| I also think the question of oversight has been brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| but I just want to clarify a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| If this body passes this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| the applicant still has, I think, four types of oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| or bodies to go through in order to get final approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5514)|
| 1:32:00| With the Master Sound Plan, they have to go through planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| and they have to go through Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| and both of those, excuse me, Planning Commission is able to be appealed in different ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5527)|
| 1:32:14| according to Mr. Frost, to either BZA and or to this body here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| So I think it's just important for those at home and those in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| to know that there are multiple levels of scrutiny for this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| regardless of the outcome of tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| I do also, and I'll wrap up soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| I have real caution with all of the land use issues that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| where we have processes and asking folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| I'm of the opinion that if you lay out the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| somebody buys land or wants to use land that they're on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| they get to use it as the code allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| When they ask for a rezoning or some change, the community gets a voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| and so it's important that that voice be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| but it's also important that whatever precedent we set tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| for this really big project will apply to smaller projects down the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5579)|
| 1:33:05| who also want to use the plan development process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| I also have a lot of concerns related to small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| not getting some of these deviations that are proposed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5593)|
| 1:33:18| I'll pause now and let some others weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5601)|
| 1:33:22| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| Who was next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| I'll make it quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| I forgot to bring up this point, and I have to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| I just don't agree that the community benefits outlined here are adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5619)|
| 1:33:45| One thing I wanted to point out that just keeps bothering me tremendously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5625)|
| 1:33:52| and I have heard from many community members who are also bothered by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| but the first item, connecting the Old City and East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| This stadium proposes to close another street connecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| East Knoxville into the Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| I remember growing up, I used to be able to walk down Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| straight into the Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| So I'm very confused how this monstrosity that's going to take up another street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5652)|
| 1:34:19| is a connector from the Old City into East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5659)|
| 1:34:24| That's one thing I wanted to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5664)|
| 1:34:28| The other thing is that at our first workshop on this stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5668)|
| 1:34:33| Randy Boyd with Boyd Sports guaranteed to us that whether this stadium moves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5673)|
| 1:34:40| forward or not, he is going to redevelop this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5680)|
| 1:34:44| So any of the benefits here about revitalizing the area would all move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5684)|
| 1:34:51| without public dollars, would all move forward without zoning changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5691)|
| 1:34:56| and special exceptions that our small business owners don't have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| I just wanted to make that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| Thank you, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| Or Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5709)|
| 1:35:10| I had my light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| You did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| So I just want to encourage my colleagues to go ahead and vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| I was around, I ran Nine Counties, One Vision when we did the sign thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5720)|
| 1:35:26| Ms. Feld is absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| We do care about signs, but I am going on the assumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5728)|
| 1:35:36| because I haven't been shown otherwise, that the process will work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5736)|
| 1:35:42| that we've laid out a process, people can be engaged in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| as it moves through planning and then any appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5747)|
| 1:35:52| and let's trust that this process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| If it doesn't, ultimately it becomes before City Council and we have a say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5755)|
| 1:36:00| I want to respond to the comment that without the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5760)|
| 1:36:06| all the benefits that we think the stadium will bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5766)|
| 1:36:10| will still accrue based on any other development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5770)|
| 1:36:14| I respectfully disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| There is no timeline for that new proposed whatever it is development will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| It may or may not happen within the next two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| but redevelopment may eventually happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| and it will still currently be zoned as industrial mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| So I just respectfully disagree that everything the stadium will bring us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5792)|
| 1:36:39| will come to us regardless of what development occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| Council Member Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| I don't know that I'm going to say anything that's uniquely different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| from several of my colleagues, but, you know, point is for or against recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5813)|
| 1:37:00| The purpose of recode was to elevate our standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| and to create greater consistency with our development across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| And between plans review, between planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| we have an inordinate number of experts, of team members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5834)|
| 1:37:20| who are reviewing these standards and these codes day in and day out, all day, every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5840)|
| 1:37:28| And because of this, we do have the processes in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| There are multiple avenues for checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5852)|
| 1:37:36| You know, I, too, concur with, you know, the concerns with signage or landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5856)|
| 1:37:44| But I feel like we've got to trust these processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| This is far too big of a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| It's far too high profile to, for these changes not to go undetected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5871)|
| 1:37:59| and to also include a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| And, you know, I agree with my colleague, you know, Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5884)|
| 1:38:10| And I think, you know, our lead architect, Mr. Hirschhoffler, would probably agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5890)|
| 1:38:16| that if we go back to commission, if it's denied, if this doesn't happen or it goes home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5896)|
| 1:38:22| then the stadium project is not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| And I just feel like that it's too monumental for the future of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5905)|
| 1:38:32| Thank you, Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| I want to thank the speakers that came and spoke today on this topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| and my colleagues for your input and your comments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| At this point, I think that there were some very valid concerns that were stated today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5926)|
| 1:38:52| that I certainly hope that the developers will take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5932)|
| 1:38:56| as they move forward with this preliminary plan and this process if it's approved by my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5936)|
| 1:39:01| However, we have the process in place, and I think that at this point, as we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5941)|
| 1:39:07| it is incumbent upon all of us to stay close to the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| and make sure that the standards and the designs are such that will be agreeable with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5951)|
| 1:39:18| Scenic Knoxville, Sandra, who came and spoke today as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| it's incumbent upon all of us as a stadium, if the stadium is to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| that it's done in excellence, looking at recode and also taking into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5967)|
| 1:39:33| the concerns and the standards of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| So I think my question is going to be directed to the applicant for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| Mr. Kirchhofer, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| I'm not sure who wants to answer my question or Miss Brooks about the master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5990)|
| 1:39:58| So our option here tonight are to pass this or to pass it with conditions or to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=5998)|
| 1:40:06| And if we pass this, then you guys are going to apply for landscaping plan, lighting plan, master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6006)|
| 1:40:16| And in this preliminary plan, you guys have asked for exceptions to the sign code to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6016)|
| 1:40:24| things that are typically prohibited, banner signs, roof signs, rotating signs, ground surface signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6024)|
| 1:40:29| portable signs, and animated signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| So I guess my question is, I don't know if your designers want to answer the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| what is the plan or what are the thoughts for why these exceptions were asked for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6036)|
| 1:40:44| Because if that goes on through a master sign plan and then it's going to get appealed to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6044)|
| 1:40:51| then it's going to be right back here in that venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| But go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| I'll let you answer what your thoughts were in putting these exceptions in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| Kelly Hedden, 505 Market Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| And could you tell us your role in this application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| I'm one of the principals in one of the architect record firms, Jim Associated Architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6065)|
| 1:41:14| My role is with Barbara McMurray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6074)|
| 1:41:19| In thinking through and working with staff on what this request would include,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6079)|
| 1:41:28| we were very careful to include precedents and examples from other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6088)|
| 1:41:36| Many of you have seen, and we've even had one of the speakers tonight mention Fort Wayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6096)|
| 1:41:42| Our design specialist, Populous, an international sports design firm, designed Fort Wayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6102)|
| 1:41:49| We've looked at Atlanta, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| We've looked at Madison, Alabama, Kannapolis, North Carolina, Atlanta, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6111)|
| 1:41:56| They designed all of those stadiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| and we have shown staff examples of what we might need to ask for once all of our parameters are known,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6118)|
| 1:42:05| when we know the size of all of the potential leases and the vendors that might be in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6125)|
| 1:42:14| the retail establishments, the restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| When we know the numbers of sponsors, is there a lead sponsor for the stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| Who owns naming rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| When we know all of those things, we're going to come back with a final signed package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| and present it through the regular channels that the process prescribes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6148)|
| 1:42:33| But we don't know yet what all of those things include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6153)|
| 1:42:37| We're not expecting to ask for every one of those things that's listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| It's just that we might ask for two or three of those things, given the parameters, once they're all defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6161)|
| 1:42:49| We're asking you, at the conceptual schematic design level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6169)|
| 1:42:53| to approve what we've spent weeks and weeks talking through with staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6173)|
| 1:42:58| and being very specific about, here are the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| very forthcoming about the things we might ask for in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6181)|
| 1:43:06| But we really need to know before all of the real details are developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6186)|
| 1:43:10| and lots of time, effort, and dollars are spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| are you interested in this stadium at a conceptual level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6193)|
| 1:43:17| Yes, no, if it's yes, we hope it's yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| Then we want to come back and go through the traditional process with all of the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6200)|
| 1:43:25| Everybody deserves that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| We want, as an architect that's practiced here for 32 years and one of the principals of our firms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6207)|
| 1:43:34| both Ferris and I, the two firms involved locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6214)|
| 1:43:38| our livelihood depends on this being pleasing and a positive addition to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6218)|
| 1:43:46| So we very much want that, and we'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| With that, I hope I have answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6229)|
| 1:43:53| Ms. Ryder, do you have any follow-up questions for the applicant's rep?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| No, I appreciate the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6237)|
| 1:44:03| So you're basically saying that when you present your master sign plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6243)|
| 1:44:07| you may have all or none of these things in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| We're not anticipating to have all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| We would likely have two or three, and we don't know yet what those might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6253)|
| 1:44:19| I would be shocked if that isn't a possibility at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6259)|
| 1:44:26| We would expect probably to have kickback because we know that those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6266)|
| 1:44:31| at least for the typical project, aren't acceptable now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| and it takes a special use and a special set of conditions to allow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6274)|
| 1:44:44| Thank you, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6284)|
| 1:44:45| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| And this discussion actually addressed some of the questions that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6288)|
| 1:44:54| But I wanted to ask, is the use of these signs currently a part of the negotiations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6294)|
| 1:45:03| Any potential revenue that could come from these signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6303)|
| 1:45:08| Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| Councilmember Parker, that's not the topic of tonight's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6310)|
| 1:45:15| That's more of a discussion about the development agreement and the lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6315)|
| 1:45:21| But I will tell you that revenue sources are part of that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| It stuns me when I get such an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6331)|
| 1:45:39| The reason I bring this up is because we don't even have an idea of what the intended use of these signs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6339)|
| 1:45:47| and whether there's a need to deviate from the sign standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6347)|
| 1:45:53| If we're talking about, you know, I remember discussion around the science museum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6353)|
| 1:45:58| and potential ways that the name would be portrayed on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6358)|
| 1:46:06| And it seems like if the identifying sign for the building were similar to the Parkview Field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6366)|
| 1:46:17| it would be in line with the design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| What I'm imagining is another source of revenue, potentially, for the manager of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6381)|
| 1:46:28| And if that's what we're talking about, that's not truly a community benefit that warrants this exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6388)|
| 1:46:37| And rather, if we're talking about a community benefit from potentially revenue-producing signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6397)|
| 1:46:44| I would like for that revenue to be dedicated to a community good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| It could go towards, you know, there's a program I learned about in St. Louis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| where they established a new tax fund to create savings accounts for folks living below the poverty line in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6415)|
| 1:47:05| There are actual community benefits that could be negotiated if that's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6425)|
| 1:47:11| But deviating from the sign standards to potentially create another revenue source for the person managing the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6431)|
| 1:47:21| just does not seem like a community benefit that would warrant the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| Thank you, Councilmember Parker. Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6451)|

| 1:49:04| Council members, I've gotten a couple questions about this, so I just want to give you a little context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6544)|
| 1:49:09| This agenda item was requested by Chief Thomas and Human Resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| Dr. Kelly Drummond has walked us through this process to reopen this position that did exist in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6553)|
| 1:49:19| I support this step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| We are constantly looking for ways to improve the resources available to KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6561)|
| 1:49:25| and by bringing back the appointed police assistant chief as an available option adds another tool in our toolbox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6565)|
| 1:49:32| as we look to strengthen KPD's ability to address public safety challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6572)|
| 1:49:36| So that's what it's all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| One question that I have, Chief, my understanding, so you currently have three deputy chiefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6582)|
| 1:49:51| I think we're budgeted for potentially four, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| And so this position essentially, and I'll let you speak to this, really wouldn't be necessarily a budget increase at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6595)|
| 1:50:05| Just stay speaking into your mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| It's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6607)|
| 1:50:08| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| So my understanding, though, this wouldn't be necessarily a budget increase at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| Can you speak to that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| When Deputy Chief Gary Holiday retired, I actually changed the department makeup from four divisions to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6619)|
| 1:50:28| We've been running quite well in three divisions, each headed by a deputy chief, and that's their area of responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6628)|
| 1:50:34| So I've had that fourth deputy chief position open, and this is the position that I would use to convert to an assistant chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6634)|
| 1:50:41| So, yes, that would be the pay band that the assistant chief would be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| Question to Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| Chief, do you envision that you would take applications for this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6654)|
| 1:51:00| or would you just pretty much just kind of look at the talent pool and make an appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6660)|
| 1:51:05| Well, I'll leave that to HR to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| I'm assuming I would need to, but if Dr. Drummond could help me out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6668)|
| 1:51:14| Dr. Drummond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6674)|
| 1:51:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6675)|
| 1:51:24| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| You will be able to appoint someone to that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6686)|
| 1:51:30| You will have the ability to open it, or you can make the decision to appoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6690)|
| 1:51:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6702)|
| 1:51:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6703)|
| 1:51:44| Chief, can you tell us a little bit about what, you know, obviously it's in our packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6704)|
| 1:51:51| but just for the folks watching at home, what you envision the assistant chief to be doing and helping out with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6711)|
| 1:51:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| As I have moved through these last little over three years, four months, two days, 24 hours, 23 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6720)|
| 1:52:07| I have learned that there is a lot of responsibility in trying to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6727)|
| 1:52:14| and make sure my vision is understood by the entire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6734)|
| 1:52:20| It is imperative that I'm able to reach out to my employees and talk to my officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6740)|
| 1:52:26| and professional staff and make them understand that vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| And I think this will help me to do that, which will help us to address crime issues, address cultural issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6750)|
| 1:52:39| address any issues that we have more efficiently and effectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| because I will have somebody right there beside me who does not have other responsibilities to a division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6762)|
| 1:52:48| as my other deputy chiefs have, that will be able to help me with my vision and overseeing the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6768)|
| 1:52:54| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| And, you know, I certainly see the need for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| I definitely intend to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| What I was wondering is can somebody address whether or not making any allocations here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6782)|
| 1:53:07| or creating this position would in any way affect if there's a potential for a retention or recruitment bonus at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6787)|
| 1:53:14| or if there'd be anything that we'd have to look at for any interference from making this change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6794)|
| 1:53:20| with addressing competitive pay for our officers who are on the beat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6800)|
| 1:53:27| Well, Council Member Berger, I'd just say that any bonuses that I'm going to propose would have a deadline that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6807)|
| 1:53:35| whoever is filling this position, if they're new to the department, wouldn't be eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6815)|
| 1:53:40| I just want to make sure that we're going to still be able to address competitive pay issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6820)|
| 1:53:47| as well as very well-deserved bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6830)|
| 1:53:51| We're in the process of doing that, you know, compensation study, and Dr. Drummond is leading that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6831)|
| 1:53:57| and it's happening right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| And, yeah, that's moving forward, and this has no bearing or will not detract from that in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6839)|
| 1:54:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6854)|
| 1:54:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6855)|
| 1:54:16| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| 12F is an ordinance to rezone property located at 4849 Chambliss Avenue from RN4 District 2O,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6858)|
| 1:54:26| Joshua Bishop Applicant, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| Council Member Berger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6876)|
| 1:54:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| I just had a couple of clarifying points for Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6878)|
| 1:54:43| There was a very good debate and discussion at Planning Commission on this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6883)|
| 1:54:48| and I certainly respect all the opinions that we've heard from the Planning Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6888)|
| 1:54:52| and I know there was a split vote here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| What was the rationale for staff's approval or staff's recommendation not to make this change to office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6895)|
| 1:55:05| Staff's recommendation for denial was based on the fact that rezoning this to O, office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6905)|
| 1:55:15| would put this property into a situation where it would not meet the dimensional requirements for the office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6915)|
| 1:55:21| And so, you know, I think staff are tasked with reviewing our plans and our zoning ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6921)|
| 1:55:28| and making recommendations according to those documents that we've been charged to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6928)|
| 1:55:35| Director Brooks, the properties or the parcels surrounding this particular property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| they've been transitioning from residential to office over many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6940)|
| 1:55:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6946)|
| 1:55:47| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6947)|
| 1:55:48| When I looked at it over the map, it looks like more than 60% of the parcels around this have already made this transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6948)|
| 1:55:57| There was some discussion of nonconformities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| Do those nonconformities exist in other parcels in this same area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6960)|
| 1:56:06| You know, we haven't looked at each individual one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| There was a rezoning that went through in 2019 prior to the new code being adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6968)|
| 1:56:14| that did result in some nonconformities, so that one I can speak to directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6974)|
| 1:56:19| But yes, I mean, those are typically small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| Block coverage is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6982)|
| 1:56:24| It probably, for many of them, exceeds what's currently allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6984)|
| 1:56:28| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6988)|
| 1:56:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| Thank you, Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| Oh, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| I just have one question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| I'm just curious what your plans are for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| Can you share some of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7003)|
| 1:56:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7004)|
| 1:56:45| Josh Bishop, 4820 Old Kingston Park, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7005)|
| 1:56:49| What we want to do is just rezone the property as office to give us the use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| the ability to kind of hit the target market of office use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7013)|
| 1:56:59| But it still could be residential under the office use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7019)|
| 1:57:03| It's just that we'd like the flexibility that the other property adjacent owners have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7023)|
| 1:57:11| in terms of marketing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7031)|

| 1:58:28| Mr. Posey, if you could come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| You'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7111)|

| 1:58:41| My name is Rob Posey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| 2647 Windjammer Lane, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7123)|
| 1:58:50| Appreciate the opportunity, Mayor, City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7130)|
| 1:58:54| It's really an honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| It's a very humbling experience for someone like myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7136)|
| 1:59:00| It's almost a feeling as I'm here in this meeting where it's the same feeling I have in church almost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7140)|
| 1:59:07| where it's just an honor to see how nice and well-spoken everyone is, to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7147)|
| 1:59:17| I never thought I'd see myself here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| We recently relocated, and I say we, I mean my family and I, from a small town in Missouri.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7160)|
| 1:59:32| Our contracting company, we got a couple jobs in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| We didn't know much about the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| We didn't know much about the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7178)|
| 1:59:41| We've never been to the Smoky Mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| So, you know, not cultured, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7183)|
| 1:59:47| And coming here is a decision, more of a personal decision just to further my career, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7187)|
| 1:59:55| And I thought that would help my family, help my kids, better high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7195)|
| 2:00:00| And it did so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| We've been here about two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| We have fallen, we've absolutely fallen in love with Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7208)|
| 2:00:13| We're sold, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7213)|
| 2:00:15| So the people are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| The community is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| Everything is almost picturesque.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7218)|
| 2:00:23| So once I found out that there was a new stadium potentially being built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7223)|
| 2:00:30| of course I wanted to figure out, you know, what can I do as an individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7230)|
| 2:00:38| Put my company to the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| What can we do to help this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| What we offer through our company is we offer, we're a union contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7243)|
| 2:00:48| We are local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| We do hire skilled tradespeople.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| We do pay them a good wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7254)|
| 2:00:59| I know typically for the area, it's not a union town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| We do feel like we can be competitive in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| We encourage the council, the mayor, everybody here, to look into local contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7267)|
| 2:01:18| I encourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| My dad being a superintendent growing up, I can remember driving down the road, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7280)|
| 2:01:25| through mid-Missouri, St. Louis, and he would point out buildings and structures that he would build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7285)|
| 2:01:32| And I could just see the pride with that, you know, push 18 years forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7292)|
| 2:01:39| And, you know, I graduated high school and really didn't have much ambition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7299)|
| 2:01:48| My uncle got me into the carpenter's union at 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| At that point, I didn't realize how blessed I was to have a good wage, to have insurance, these kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7312)|
| 2:02:01| And then 15 years later, I'm driving through those same roads with my three children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7321)|
| 2:02:06| pointing out other structures that I've built that I've helped with the Missouri skyline and things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7326)|
| 2:02:12| I've had that opportunity now in Knoxville for the last two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7332)|
| 2:02:16| I'm hoping that my sons and my daughters' kids will have that same opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7336)|
| 2:02:23| where they can drive through and they can show their kids and their grandkids what they've built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7343)|
| 2:02:29| And, you know, I'm very passionate about keeping construction local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7349)|
| 2:02:36| and not bringing out-of-town contractors, whether it be union or not union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7356)|
| 2:02:41| Of course, I'm going to advocate for the unions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7361)|
| 2:02:44| I feel like they are well-trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7364)|
| 2:02:46| They go through the apprenticeship program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| They are well-paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7368)|
| 2:02:51| They put the money back into the community, going to the gang, going to the other retail in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7371)|
| 2:02:59| I know all of our folks are from the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7379)|
| 2:03:03| We are hiring from the local community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| And we take a lot of pride in that because we, and I say we, and I'm talking about my family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7387)|
| 2:03:13| relocated from Missouri intentionally to start an operation here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7393)|
| 2:03:19| where we can build up a contractor that hires local and gives back to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7399)|
| 2:03:25| In doing so, I know I have 15 seconds left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7405)|
| 2:03:28| we have started an outreach with the unions, with our company and other companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7408)|
| 2:03:33| to partner up to do volunteer projects in the local community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7413)|
| 2:03:40| Thank you. Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| Thank you, Mr. President.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| Next person who signed up to speak is Julie Prill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7426)|
| 2:03:50| Ms. Prill, if you could start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7430)|
| 2:03:54| and you can have up to five minutes to talk to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7434)|
| 2:03:58| My name is Julie Prill, 104 Hill Drive, 37748.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7438)|
| 2:04:06| I'm the business representative for the International Union of Painters and Allied Trade, District Council 77.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| I represent residential, commercial, and industrial painters, drywall finishers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7451)|
| 2:04:16| and glazers in Knoxville and East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7456)|
| 2:04:20| But I'm not speaking to you just as a second-generation proud member of the painters tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7460)|
| 2:04:24| or the representative, but I'm speaking on behalf of the building trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7464)|
| 2:04:29| We're excited to be following Nashville's lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7469)|
| 2:04:33| and the others in the country establishing community benefits agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7473)|
| 2:04:37| And I wanted to speak to you all tonight about our Department of Labor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| registered apprenticeship programs that the building trades have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| Our apprenticeships combine paid on-the-job training with classroom and hands-on instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7484)|
| 2:04:49| for skilled careers for highly demanded workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7489)|
| 2:04:53| This means that our workers earn while they learn without student debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7493)|
| 2:04:59| Workers benefit from apprenticeships by receiving a skilled trade through apprenticeships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7499)|
| 2:05:05| and that prepares them for good-paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7505)|
| 2:05:08| Our apprenticeship programs help employees recruit, build, and retain local, highly skilled workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7508)|
| 2:05:14| They also receive health care benefits and a guaranteed pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7514)|
| 2:05:18| Our training creates long-term, well-paying local careers for folks who may not choose to go to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7518)|
| 2:05:26| Our apprenticeships are the perfect opportunity for young people to gain local jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7526)|
| 2:05:32| and encourage them and their families to live and thrive in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7532)|
| 2:05:36| We are equipped and ready to train organized labor trades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7536)|
| 2:05:41| but our biggest barrier is still the need for more local work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7541)|
| 2:05:45| If there isn't local work for our members, they have to work in other cities or states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7545)|
| 2:05:52| Anyone looking for a career, especially young people, you can get paid to learn as a carpenter, painter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7552)|
| 2:05:58| iron worker, teamster, electrician, or many of the other trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7558)|
| 2:06:03| Our Knoxville Oak Ridge Central Labor Council and the Knoxville Building Trades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| have a meeting with Boyd Sports tomorrow, and we are reaching out to the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7567)|
| 2:06:12| We are excited about the prospect of working with Boyd Sports, the Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7572)|
| 2:06:17| and other community partners to help ensure this is a great development for Knoxville workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7577)|
| 2:06:22| and a greater community. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211005?start=7582)|
