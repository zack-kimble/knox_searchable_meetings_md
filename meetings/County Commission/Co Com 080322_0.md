| 0:00:15| I'm Bob Ramphrey. I'm the appointed commissioner for the 6th District, and I'm sure y'all, by virtue of you being here, y'all are all interested in political goings-on in Knox County, and some of them going further than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=15)|
| 0:00:29| My co-commissioner in the 6th District is Mr. Greg Lambert, and I'd like to recognize some of the other commissioners that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=29)|

| 0:01:12| I'd also like to recognize, oh, Victoria DeVries is here from District 9. You just slipped in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=72)|
| 0:01:19| And also, I'd like to recognize State Senator Bill Dunn. Bill's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=79)|
| 0:01:28| And I'd also like to recognize Senator Dunn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=88)|
| 0:01:40| Hey, no, wait, that's Senator Fitzpatrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=100)|
| 0:01:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=103)|
| 0:01:50| We have to make Senator Birch at the governor, and I'm fine with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| Most of y'all can tell by my introduction I'm new to this game, but thank you. I'm sorry, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=116)|
| 0:02:02| And I'd also like to recognize another individual from the Powell community that's been a friend of mine for a long time, and it's Willard Scarborough there in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=122)|
| 0:02:11| Snooks, raise your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=131)|
| 0:02:21| We have Brad Hill here. He's a candidate. Brad is the Republican candidate for the seat that I currently occupy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=141)|
| 0:02:38| and he'll be running against the Democratic candidate Kathy Brown in August to fill the seat on September 1 that I'm currently temporarily occupying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=158)|
| 0:02:49| So we also have with us Ms. Kathleen Hamilton and Gary Green from the Charter Petition Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| They're going to speak on their behalf, and we're going to have a discussion of the charter amendments that have been proposed at the last commission meeting by the Charter Petition Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=175)|
| 0:03:05| So we know y'all have a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| It's Saturday afternoon, so we want to do the best job that we can in informing y'all of where we are with these proposed charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=189)|
| 0:03:17| So we're going to let the Charter Petition Group tell us where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| I've asked Dr. Briggs to represent the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| He recently suggested a resolution that we convene a charter committee to take a look at these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=206)|
| 0:03:33| So we hope when you leave here today, you have a better understanding of where we are with these charter amendment recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=213)|
| 0:03:42| And be sure if you have any questions, don't leave here with those unanswered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=227)|
| 0:03:57| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| First of all, I want to say that Pam and I appreciate getting to come out and meet in such a beautiful facility like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| I've talked to several folks from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| This is the first time I've been out in the Cal Library, and I'm really jealous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| I mean, this is a beautiful library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| It's really an amazing facility, so it's nice to get to be out here and see the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| I'm going to talk a little bit about the history and the timeline of kind of how all of this evolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| and then we'll hear you talk about some of the proposed ordinances that are out there, and then I'll finish with those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=263)|
| 0:04:30| and then I guess we can go on and take questions from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| And this really goes back, I think, to several of the folks that have worked with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| Their interest in government came originally from the nine-counties-one-vision effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| in which there were several task forces that were kind of organized and things that people really wanted to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=286)|
| 0:04:52| And one of the ones was a government task force that came out of nine-counties-one-vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| and their conclusion was that they wanted to have a region that ended up with a citizen-driven and responsive local government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=297)|
| 0:05:06| that provided a wide range of coordinated and efficient services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| So you had originally with nine-counties-one-vision a task force that had looked at some things that they wanted out of their government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| But then it was really driven by the Jordan decision that came out in January of 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| that basically came out and was the rule of long-term limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| but also said that because we were a charter form of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| that there were some structure changes that could be made in their government that nobody ever thought was possible before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| So out of that, there came a group that was called Knox County Requestion that organized in April of 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=336)|
| 0:05:43| and went out and held meetings in various parts of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| and asked people to come out and participate and to talk about the one question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| which was what changes, if any, do you as a citizen want to make to the form or structure of government in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=352)|
| 0:06:00| And we had meetings over the month of May in various places around the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| Halls, Bearden, Carter, Southwell, and Fulton High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| we had meetings to get folks to come out and inform their, throw out what their suggestions were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| We organized, divided into smaller groups and went into various rooms in the high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=378)|
| 0:06:26| and basically threw out that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| And then people recorded the responses of what people's suggestions were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| took those out, and then voted on what their top three suggestions were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| Those got posted on a website, on the Knox County One Question website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| and then also we provided a form on the website for other citizens to leave comments on the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=404)|
| 0:06:51| if they weren't able to come to those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| What happened after that is that the Baker Center, well actually as soon as that process was over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=415)|
| 0:07:01| the Baker Center was at those meetings because if there were questions that were raised about their involvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=421)|
| 0:07:09| we had a little meeting in the first before we went into the rooms for folks to give their comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| And the Baker Center talked about what was going to happen afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=434)|
| 0:07:17| the fact that they were going to take these comments, see what the citizens of the community were interested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| and they were going to go out and do some research with other governments and come back with a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| on what was being done in other places and what they felt like some best practices were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| that would address the concerns that the citizens in the community had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| So in August, August the 1st, the Baker Center released that report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| and they talked about the fact that some of the findings were that structure did matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| that professionalism and accountability in a local government is much more difficult with a very long ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=468)|
| 0:07:56| and then Knox County did have a very long ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| We elected 55 total officials between the executive, legislative, provincial, and school board positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=479)|
| 0:08:06| They said that Knox County elected substantially more officials to the legislative branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=486)|
| 0:08:15| and executive branch, 26 to an average of 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| And then when you look at the commission, that we're substantially larger, 19 is compared to 9 being the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| Now, one of the things that's been pointed out, they did say that also in the type of government that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=505)|
| 0:08:32| even though the average is 9, the type of government that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| with an elected executive and an elected commission, that the average there was 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| but overall it was 9 versus the 19 that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| They said that the best practices in the county commission structure was a mixed district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=524)|
| 0:08:50| and at large representatives had staggered terms and had nonpartisan elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| and that we weren't organized like that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| They also talked about the fact that the executive branch has several different divisions in our government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| where in the Pierce, there's generally only one elected executive branch leader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| and compared that to the form of most other governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| In the state, in the federal government, you typically have a legislative chief executive officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| and then you have the legislative branch, and you have the judicial branch for government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| We really work form like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| We've got a number of people who are elected executive branch officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| They said that the charter and ethical provisions to decrease vandritism, nepotism, and conflicts of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=572)|
| 0:09:42| make a difference in local government performance, and that was kind of the summary of their finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=582)|
| 0:09:49| Then on September the 9th, the steering committee, I'm not going to get into more questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| took the Baker Center report and took the feedback of the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| and we kind of laid it side by side to see what was on the lap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| where one of the citizens said that they were concerned about that the Baker Center had come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| and had given us the best practice language about that we felt like we could put together and put out some recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| and that was put out in the form of a report to the citizens, to the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=615)|
| 0:10:23| published in the newspaper also that the citizens and the government officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| both could see what the recommendations and what the report was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| and it started having discussions and things started happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| And then in January, the group built charter petition was formed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=636)|
| 0:10:45| because we really hadn't had a lot of action taken on the report or on its suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=645)|
| 0:10:51| so the charter petition group formed and came out with a series of ordinances as proposed changes to the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=651)|
| 0:10:58| that they wanted to get put on the ballot so that the citizens could vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| The way that they were put together was as two different petitions rather than nine individual petitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=663)|
| 0:11:12| for the reason that you had about 40,000 signatures that would have to be gathered for each petition to have it put on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=672)|
| 0:11:22| and the group really didn't think it was feasible to try and go out and get nine separate petitions organized and circulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=682)|
| 0:11:30| and to try and get the election commission to certify 300-and-some-odd-thousand signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=690)|
| 0:11:37| So they felt like the best means to do it was to put them into two separate things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| but then also to go back and ask commission to take a look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| see if they would consider putting them on the ballot for vote because of the fact that they could, by vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=707)|
| 0:11:54| put them on there as nine separate ordinances, giving the citizens the right to choose on each of the nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=714)|
| 0:12:01| instead of having to group them together, and we really felt like that was a better means of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| Plus, we would avoid the cost to the election commission of having to certify all those signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| They were filed with the election commission, and we went before county commission and had an initial reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=731)|
| 0:12:18| At that point in time, some things have changed since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| At that point in time, we thought that really we would have to move forward fairly quickly to try and get it on the August ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=742)|
| 0:12:29| and also felt like because of the fact that we filed those petitions with the election commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| that we were really going to have to go forward with them and not go forward with anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| And then after the first reading of that, we started talking about timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| We started talking about whether or not it was possible to make any changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| and the group found that we were able to file some alternate petitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| that we probably had a little bit longer timeframe that we could, in fact, by petition, get it out on the November ballots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=770)|
| 0:12:57| to the August ballot, which is good news for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| I mean, there's been a lot of conversation about the short timeframe after we went forward to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=780)|
| 0:13:07| but what I want to tell you all about that is that this is, again, this is a process that started back in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=787)|
| 0:13:13| and that has been going on with the public meetings since May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| We've been talking about government in this community from last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| and we really wanted to make sure that we were able to bring this to the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| while we really had the attention and had the focus of the citizens on Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| and on what they really wanted to happen in Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| So that's what was driving the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| We really felt like we made a commitment to give the citizens the right to hear this and to have it put on the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| and we felt like that needed to happen in this series of elections instead of waiting until 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| So that's it. I'm going to let Gary Drennan talk about some of the changes or some of the differences that we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| Actually, I guess if it's okay in the interest of bringing out even more new information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| Dr. Brooks, if you could just talk about real quick the motion you made last week in the committee meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| and this brings you up to speed with where we were on February 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| How have things changed since then? If that's okay with Commissioner Lambert and Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| Yeah, my name is Richard Briggs, and I'm one of the commissioners from the 5th District out west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| In February, when the commission met, there were nine amendments that were brought forward to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| and that evening—let me back up just a little bit so you know what the different processes are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| on how you can put an amendment on the ballot to be voted either on, to be added to the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=876)|
| 0:14:43| or to be eliminated, of course, if the amendment fails. There's three ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| You can bring an amendment to the county commission, and there'll be two readings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| and if it passes on two readings, it will go on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| The other way to do it is through the petition process, where the way it stands right now—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| some of this is a little controversial, but really you have to have 15% of the registered voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| and as I mentioned, it's somewhere between 36 and 40,000 signatures that you would need in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| That's another way you can put an amendment on the ballot to be voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| to see if it's going to be added to our county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| And then the third way is for the mayor to appoint a charter review committee that can review the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=919)|
| 0:15:27| They can add amendments to the charter, it's an open meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| and what happens with that is there has to be one commissioner from each of the nine commission districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=930)|
| 0:15:37| and then the mayor can appoint a minimum of 10 citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| so the citizens always have a majority, a minimum of 10, and he can't appoint more citizens than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| So those are really the three, and then when the citizens in the charter review committee has this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| this is a combination of commissioners and citizens, the meetings all fall under the Sunshine Law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| so they're conducted in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| Other county officers or holders can come before the committee to make suggestions and recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| Citizens can come before the committee to make suggestions and recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| And then at some point 60 days before the next general election, but not less than 45 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=974)|
| 0:16:22| the committee, charter review committee, has several options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| One, they can recommend that the amendments be passed to the election committee, election commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=986)|
| 0:16:33| to be put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| It does not go back to the county commission to be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| Or two, they send a message back to the mayor that amendments have been rejected or there are no amendments to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| So those are really the three ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| And so where we stood at the commission meeting in February is that on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1005)|
| 0:16:52| seven of the nine amendments that were proposed by the charter petition group were passed on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1012)|
| 0:17:00| Two were rejected, the one that reorganizes the executive branch of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| We'll talk about those in just a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| And then the other one is one which they call the consistency amendment that said all new amendments supersede the old ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1026)|
| 0:17:14| Now that's what has subsequently been dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| So really we're dealing right now with eight amendments of those that have been proposed by the charter petition group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| Many of the commissioners, and I think many citizens, have some concerns about ambiguities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1041)|
| 0:17:30| and wording in the amendments that we have passed on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| And it also seemed that things were moving very fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| But really to get these things straightened out, we had up until this meeting that's coming up on Monday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| when the commission meets again where we're going to have the second reading on those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| to try to get that worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| And it seemed like a very short time frame to work some of those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| Now the charter petition group has met again and they've changed some of the wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| and they'll talk about what's been changed here in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| And I've been pleased with some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| One of the amendments just had too much clutched together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| so I think people could be confused about what they're really voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| And many of us had concerns that there would be unintended consequences of having ambiguities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| In other words, there could be a series of lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| There was one that was stuck on reducing the county commission from 19 to 11 members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| and we'll talk about that, about reorganizing the school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| And we may or may not want to do that since the school board did not have any input into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| But that's been dropped also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| But as a consequence is the commission voted to ask the mayor to appoint a charter review commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1115)|
| 0:18:43| And I just mentioned how that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| The mayor will appoint one commissioner from each of the commission districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| and there will be a minimum of ten citizens and there can be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| And then what will happen, this committee will meet, everything's public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| everyone can come forward to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| We would suggest that it's publicized and broadcast on the community television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| And they would have, if you count back to when the election is in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| they would have 90 days to make their suggestions on either to accept amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1151)|
| 0:19:18| to modify the amendments that come up, the final recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| And if it passes that committee, it goes straight to the election committee to be on the office ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| And I think that's where we stand right now with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| Mr. Griggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| I believe you're wrong about the commission voting for this charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| I believe that was just in the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| We haven't voted on that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| He's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| What we voted for, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| What we voted for on Monday, and this was at the Intergovernmental and Finance Committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| we voted for the law director to draw up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| and this is my recollection, to draw up a resolution to send to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| asking him to appoint a charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| I think that's right, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| I believe you meant that recommendation in the Intergovernmental, if I'm correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| I thought we just put it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| So we haven't voted on anything yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| I think it's also fair to say that the mayor, we don't have to ask the mayor to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1218)|
| 0:20:28| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| The mayor can do that because that's the third pathway to the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| We ask that to be considered at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| Let's put it on the agenda on Monday's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| But the mayor doesn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| No, he doesn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| And the other thing in our charter, it does say that the commission is able to ratify the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| Now, not each individual member that the mayor appoints, but the whole committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1253)|
| 0:21:00| We can say yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| When the mayor appoints these people, it then comes to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| and they have to approve all of them or disapprove of the whole committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| They can't go through and say, I like this person, I don't like this person, I like this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| They have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| The list that the mayor submits has to be approved or disapproved as a block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| Why would the mayor submit a list, period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| Why don't we just go and vote for those individuals the way we always have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| Because the county charter doesn't allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| We'd have to change the county charter to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| Can you imagine, can you just imagine Mayor Ragsdale appointing the governor of the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| You're right, we still can elect them so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1302)|
| 0:21:57| We need to elect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| We're getting off the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1319)|
| 0:22:13| What we're talking about right now, we're not talking about the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| We're talking about the charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| Ultimately, the charter review committee is going to decide which amendments go on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1337)|
| 0:22:25| how they're worded, and ultimately the charter review committee is going to be appointed by the county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| So basically, you might as well say that the mayor will have a significant amount of control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| over what kind of folks wind up on this committee, what their philosophies are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| whether they're for these amendments, whether they're against these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| The county mayor will have a tremendous amount of power when deciding who's going to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| I think when we look at the mayor's picks, when we see folks on this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| if we see folks that are from the one question group, when we see people like that on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1375)|
| 0:23:08| I think when we see special interest on the committee, we'll be seeing what the mayor's intention is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1388)|
| 0:23:15| The mayor will have a tremendous amount of control over what this committee does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| Also, the mayor is not bound by any sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| The mayor can call any member of this committee at any time and discuss what's going to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1403)|
| 0:23:31| So the mayor appoints the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| The mayor can communicate with folks on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| So the mayor ultimately, if this goes to have a charter review committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| the mayor ultimately will have a tremendous amount of power in how this is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| I think Victoria had her hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| Yes. Another thing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| I was wondering, is this committee going to be privy to legal counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| That's my question number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| My second question is the way that Dr. Briggs described about getting an item on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1439)|
| 0:24:09| One was by getting 15% of the registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| However, that's not what appears in our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| That's a Tennessee state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| In our charter, it says it's 15% of those who voted in the last gubernatorial race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| So, you know, there again, I think the people who put this petition charter together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1463)|
| 0:24:29| did not really review our current charter because we do operate by home rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| There are going to be some legalities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| And I'm wondering, we have not had really a clear answer, have we, by our legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1475)|
| 0:24:42| And the not charter petition legal counsel are in disagreement continually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| So I think that this committee, if it's so appointed and if it continues and proceeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| is going to have a very difficult time agreeing on what should appear on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| I think they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| Let me ask Roger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| Roger was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| Oh, the lady, what is your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| You spoke about the constitution of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| What is your name, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| What's your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| My name is Maggie Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| You made a very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| The notion that we're facing a problem here because any incumbent mayor appointing this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| has all power to appoint the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| And he can take people he likes and he don't like, unbalance, unbalance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| And we must either reject the entire thing or accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| It seems to me that if Mayor Ragsdale intends to limit his charge to the committee to only these eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1541)|
| 0:25:48| don't we lack the opportunity to look at that very question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| We should allow an amendment to be brought forth that the commission can be allowed to accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| or reject every member or a tabor amendment or a right to referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| Let's open this up and let all the people speak here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| Let's not just keep it at the eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Let's make this more of a better government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| Let's open it up, let everyone come forward, and let's try to reform it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| and make this a really productive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| Do you agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| This won't be a committee chosen by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| And so we'll see if that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| I'm not holding my breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| With all due respect to some of the elected officials here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| it's my understanding that this was supposed to be a citizens' meeting for the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| Isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| I would respectfully—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| Roger, it's not necessarily just for the people of the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| It's a meeting for citizens to express their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| I attended several of these in different parts of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| and if someone lives in South Knoxville, for instance, and they didn't make that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| or they want to come out here because maybe there's commissioners present here to hear their thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| that were not present at the one in their district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1621)|
| 0:27:08| everybody has a right to speak here, and we represent all of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| regardless of where we're elected from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| And I'm interested in hearing what folks have to say, regardless of where they're from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| Well, with all due respect, I would like for the citizens to be given an opportunity to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| So far, I'm hearing commissioners talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| This is for the citizens. This should be a citizens' forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| And I would respectfully ask that the commissioners from other districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| they're welcome to listen, but it's the time for the citizens to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| Roger, he wanted to speak, and a commissioner from another district is also a citizen from another district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1660)|
| 0:27:47| And they are welcome to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| You have the commission meetings every month, and the committee meetings for the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| You have ample opportunity to speak. This is an opportunity for us to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| The time is for the citizens to speak now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| And these folks are citizens, too. I don't care what district they're from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| I don't care what job they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| If somebody wants to say something here today, raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| You will be recognized, and you will be allowed to talk for as long as you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| We are not going to have a meeting that shuts down debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1693)|
| 0:28:19| Lest we appear to be poor hosts, I understand what Roger is saying about this being a citizens' opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| but I personally very much appreciate all our commissioners being here to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| I just had a point for Commissioner DeFries concerning the legal counsel that might be available to a Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1709)|
| 0:28:39| I think that the law director oversees those meetings, does he not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1719)|
| 0:28:46| I recall that Mike Reuters used to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| This is just a one person's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| I cannot imagine how you can draw up all that you have to do without an attorney for the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| It's the law director's responsibility to understand who begins those ballot issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| No, I would have to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| Tamara, I think I may have answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| I had a meeting with the law director the other day just to ask him about that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| The Charter Review Committee will act almost as a committee of county commission in some ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| The county clerk will take the minutes of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| The law director will be present to provide legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| It's a very official meeting that will have the clerk and the law director's office there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| At least that's my understanding, which I think is, in my personal opinion, good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| Personally, so far, these issues are so convoluted, the decisions have been hard to put in that sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1774)|
| 0:29:46| I think one thing that would be important, Commissioner Smith, one concern I have, and thanks to people who brought it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1786)|
| 0:29:54| is we're going to get this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| I called yesterday at 430 to ask who was on that list, who would give it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| So we're going to see it Monday at our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| I need some time to, like you say, do a little research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| Who's who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| I mean, I know quite a few people, but in fairness, I'd like to know who's who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| Well, the Charter, I think what the Charter says about that, and I think that's an excellent point you brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| and I was a little surprised that we hadn't seen it yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| but the Charter says that when the mayor makes the list available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| the commission has to act on it within five business days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| I was told this morning, again, in administration, they would get it at the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| Well, that's probably correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| Well, that's exactly what I was told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| It didn't surprise me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| But when the list comes out, the only point I make is that when the list comes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| you have five business days to act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| I think one thing that might be helpful here is if we could take a look at the amendments that have changed or have been modified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1853)|
| 0:31:08| Some of you all may have read these amendments from four weeks ago at the last commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| and since that time, there has been a lot of constructive review of all these Charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1874)|
| 0:31:23| There have been several changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Now, Paul, you respect the group that has asked us to put these amendments on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1885)|
| 0:31:35| They have changed their mind about some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| These amendments have not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| They went on for first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| They will exist as they were with first reading until the Knox County Commission amends it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| If I bring something before to a commissioner and I say, I'd like you to bring, or we'll just say on the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| if I take something to Mr. Dunn and say, I'd like for you to take this to the state house for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| and he takes a piece of legislation up there, and then I change my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| it has not changed until it's changed in a committee in the state house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| As far as Knox County is concerned, these amendments are as they were put on the agenda the last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1930)|
| 0:32:18| until we change them through an amendment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| Now, what we have is the group that has been saying that if what we pass is not palatable to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1942)|
| 0:32:29| that they will go forward with a petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| What we actually have is they have said these following changes would be palatable to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1952)|
| 0:32:39| but they are still as they were written until we amend them in the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| This has not changed a bit because when a legislative body leaves, everything is carved in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| It's a part of the public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| Then we go back and we legislate it, we amend it, we change these things as they move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| That's kind of what's gotten us all frazzled here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| There's a real push to hurry up and do this, and I don't see why there's the demand that we do it by a certain time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1984)|
| 0:33:12| My suspicion is that because of the instability and the chaos in Knox County government right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=1992)|
| 0:33:21| there is a small, well-funded group of people that want to change Knox County government forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| Let me tell you what state of instability that we are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| When Brad Anders, and I'm a Republican and I can't wait to vote for Mr. Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| when Brad Anders is elected to the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| within a two-year period we will have had five separate legislative bodies in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2018)|
| 0:33:45| If these charter amendments go forward on the next ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| in a two-year period we will have essentially had three charters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| A charter is the local version of a constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| Guys, right now we are less stable than Iraq.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| And we have a small, well-funded group of people, well-meaning folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| They believe in these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| They believe that this is the way government should be ran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| But in this period of chaos, again, two-year period, five separate legislative bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| two-year period, three separate charters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| They're trying to take advantage of this, and I don't see why we're in such a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| Why can't we wait until 2010?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| Why can't we wait and take a breather?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| Greg, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| In the name of God, y'all have got a ballot that y'all are going to have to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| how we're going to pay our taxes in this county, and you've got to balance this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| And how are nine of you going to come off of this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| and give the work that's going to have to go into this budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| How are you going to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| It's going to be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| All I'll say is that if I'm chosen to be on this committee, that I will work hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| I will do my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| Well, we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| I think I can make a very good case for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| Bob, you know it, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| I would like for somebody to try to tell me or to try to defend number two and three here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2119)|
| 0:35:27| reduce the number of commission seats from the current 19 to 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| and the next one is restructure the executive branch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| so the county trustee, clerk, registrar, chiefs, and law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| are all now elected, are appointed by the county mayor and approved by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| Such appointees can be removed without cause from the mayor or for a cause by conservative commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| That's a power grab if I've ever seen one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| We have heard that across the entire Dodge County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| And I think there's no two more contentious issues than what you just raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| This gentleman back here has his hand up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| Thank you for bringing that up. It gives me the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| I was at the last meeting at Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| I spoke of the people that I've talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| I alone have a hundred signatures that says I don't want my right to vote taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| I've got 2,500 or more circulating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| So if you see me at the next meeting, my bookcase will be a little thicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| Don't take a right to vote away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| That's how this country was formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| The gentleman in the camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| The very first thing that says you're on the shuttle bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| I had a limited number of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| And I had no idea we were going to have such a large response from Dodge County to come today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| Some of y'all don't have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| But I'm going to go out here and have a library and talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| I'm sorry. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| But what it says across the top is let the people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| And yet they're willing to take our right to vote away when we have worked hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| And the turmoil this county has been through over term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| And yet these people, if they're appointed, will not have term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| They can serve this mayor and the next mayor and the next mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| And we've done away with our term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| And yet their motto is let the people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| I don't quite understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| Sorry, I don't want to jump in front of anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| Sorry, you're up in my way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Let me tell you something. This sounds like a switcher baby thing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| These guys proposing all these exotic proposals, which doesn't mean a bunch of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| It's a baloney is what it is, most of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| Worst thing we ever did was start appointing a school superintendent in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| We started appointing these other officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| We've lost our right to vote. We've lost our freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| And they were smart enough to pull off the non-partisan thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| which, of course, it has to be ratified by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| But they know that you cannot have representative government without partisan voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| Because that's a check and balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| And then another thing that they're talking about doing is reducing the size of county commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| I don't want my representation to cut in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| I want more representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| And I think if we're going to have people out here, we need to vote for everybody we can vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| This group's trying to push a charter that is going to be a consolidated government, metro government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| and that's what we're going to end up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| So, you know, that's my opinion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| Who was next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Pat was next, then him, then her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| Did everybody vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| Tamara?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| My name's Tamara Shepard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| I'm someone who dares participate last summer in the Knox County One Question process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| And I have a curiosity because we had so many locations and so many group sessions going on last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2351)|
| 0:39:18| Could you show me if you participated in that process last summer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| So some of us did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| I'm curious because I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| I went down to Carter and Fulton and didn't have my hearing help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| I would say to you that I'm someone, having participated in that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2369)|
| 0:39:35| understood what goals were agreed upon last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| I've more recently been involved working with a Knox charter petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| I am now working in a Knox charter petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| But I would say to you that I appreciate some of the goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| and yet there's more than one way to skin a cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| I'm optimistic about a charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| The reason I'm optimistic about a charter review committee is, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| it allows a continuation of this opinion-gathering process that some folks are objecting that they didn't get to participate in last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2407)|
| 0:40:16| That's a valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| Everybody needs to be heard from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| And, two, it seems it would give all the stakeholders an opportunity to sit down around the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2419)|
| 0:40:27| and really back it up a little bit and have a discussion all over again about what may be broken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2427)|
| 0:40:34| and what may not be broken before presuming to say how to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| You can't say how to fix it if you don't agree on whether or not it's broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| So that's the process that I'm looking forward to through a charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2444)|
| 0:40:50| With regard to these two really contentious ones, the two you mentioned, ma'am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| everybody knows they're the most contentious ones on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| I'm looking at the goals of those two charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| And it would seem with regard to appointing these fee offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| the goals are to establish oversight of those offices where it doesn't exist now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| And hopefully to raise the qualification of those office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2473)|
| 0:41:20| And we have the opportunity to raise that qualification otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| We wouldn't necessarily have to appoint them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| But we would have to say, okay, we want this person in this office to be an accountant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| We want him to have a college degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| You know, anybody aged 18 and registered to vote can run for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| And so I'm thinking about the proposals in terms of those particular proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| in terms of what they have accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| But, again, I would hope that everybody would agree that a charter review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| is an opportunity to talk about the many ways we might go about accomplishing these goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2513)|
| 0:42:00| And that's why I, for one, am very optimistic to see that process begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| They're presently accountable to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2525)|
| 0:42:23| I just wanted to ask the question where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| You know, the first thing that caught my interest was when it was suggested that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| four and five combined together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| Are we still in that posture where you're going to combine several subjects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| or are you going to make it all down to each of these nine issues or seven issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| that are going to be voted on one after the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| I think this is a great opportunity for me to explain how I got involved in this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| I was not a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| I was kind of one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| I went to one of the meetings and had to leave early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| I got involved because I saw some ideas that I really liked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| and I saw some ideas that I wasn't really sure about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| And so I called up and I said, you know, I'd like to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| But some of these things I'm not really sure about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| Some of them I really like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| Is there a way that these can go on other than the clump of five and the clump of four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| And the discussion was that if the county commission puts them on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| they could go as nine separate questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| And I thought, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| For my personal interest, there are some of these ideas that I think are really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| Some of them, again, I'm not really sure about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| So I'd like to see county commission put them on as nine separate questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| I can go to the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| I can vote yes on the ones that I think are great ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| And I vote no on the ones that I think I'm not sure about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| So that's how I got involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| To this point, I think we're in the process of county commissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| that have approved to put seven on the ballot separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| I think we've got a lot of commissioners in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| They can answer this better than I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| But it sounds like we're probably not going to get a second reading on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| There's a decent chance there won't be a second reading on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| And a Charter Review Committee would be formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| I believe that group will then be the ones that put whatever ends up on the ballot on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| At least that's my reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| And I think of everything that we're discussing here today, that's the most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| I know it was mentioned earlier that our charter is our constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| And we can't change the state constitution except with the resolution that deals with only one subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| And obviously the reason for that is because you want yes or no on that subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| When you combine four or five, it's very hard to campaign for or against something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| So whatever comes out of here, I would appreciate if you keep it to a single subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| so that people can have their say in the ballot box and campaign for or against the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| And to that end, unless there's a lot of disagreement, what I'd like to do is just go through the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| I think we can agree that there are some amendments that are very controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| They deal with restructuring county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| There are some amendments that may not be quite as controversial as we can go through these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| I think it's okay. It might be beneficial to everybody if we just go through the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| Let's see a show of hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| Is there anybody here who doesn't know what all of these amendments say and what they mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| Is there anybody that doesn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| I think it would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| We've had some questions to clarify the rationale behind some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| For example, I may be in favor of some of these and may be not in favor of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| But I'm open-minded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| That's why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| And I'd like an explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| For example, the one of most interest to me is the one about reducing the number of commission seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| I'd like to know a rationale for that and whether that's constitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| You had a point surrounding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2727)|
| 0:45:34| You indicated that the average was 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| But you also indicated that for a government this high besides, it's 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2738)|
| 0:45:48| So I'm trying to figure out how you get from 19 to 17 to 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2748)|
| 0:45:57| And what are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| Are we looking at Sunder County, Davidson County, Hamilton County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| What are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| What the Baker Center said was that when they looked at and they started out with a number of counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2768)|
| 0:46:16| and I'm trying to see if I've got my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| Let me take a shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| I don't know that I have a list of the counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| Yeah, I'm not sure I can tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| They started out with looking at about 100 some-odd counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| And I think you need to have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| When you come to a project like this, you need to have that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| and rationale as to why you did certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| And is that in other states?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| Just let me clarify this and then we'll talk about it because here it's getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| I think we've got the ones that they talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| What they said was that on the average for counties that were organized like us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| that had a county commission and an elected county top executive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| that the average there was 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| but that overall when you compare counties of about our size, the average was 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2827)|
| 0:47:14| And then the second thing that they said was that they felt like that you got a little bit better overall view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2834)|
| 0:47:23| More, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| You said you got a little bit, they said that they felt like you got a little bit better overall view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| of the county as a whole when you had a mixture of people who were elected by district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| compared with some who were elected at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| And the way that we came up with the 9 on ours is that there were citizens in our meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2861)|
| 0:47:51| that said that they would like to see a smaller commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| And the only citizens, I don't think we got any comment from citizens that said they'd like to see a larger commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2874)|
| 0:48:01| but the first of them said that they would like to see a smaller commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| Most of them didn't throw out a number, but the ones that did threw out the number 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| And so we looked at the way that we were organized with 9 separate districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2890)|
| 0:48:16| and to try and get a little bit smaller commissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| instead of if you elected one from each district and you added two at large, you would be at 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2898)|
| 0:48:24| That wasn't the 9 that the citizens threw out a number throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| It was the 9 that we averaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| But that was where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| That question was posed at the halls meeting, and you were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2911)|
| 0:48:39| You heard my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| These districts are, this district right here goes from 975, the walk road at Loudoun County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2922)|
| 0:48:50| to Soloway in Anderson County at the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| And if you get in your car, you drive the boundaries of this district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| and this is not the largest district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| David, right now, you're living in District 8, and it's larger than District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2940)|
| 0:49:07| But I don't know how many people we represent here, Greg, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| But I can tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| There is, I had no idea when I offered my name for service that this was a full-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2956)|
| 0:49:24| This is a full-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| If you do, if you respond to your constituents, if you contact your people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| if you hold meetings like this, if you go to the meetings at the courthouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| this is a full-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| And I don't see how, right now, people like R. Larry Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| and some of the other commissioners that work a full-time job do this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| Paul, I'm sorry, Paul. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| All I was going to say is, you know, our commission, I've asked this before here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| I asked it not too long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| you have not checked to see what any of these offices do compared to other counties that you checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| You just say they've got these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| Our commission does a lot more work than some of these other districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| and these other counties that have commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| because they have people like they have their own Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| Here, it falls on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| I asked about the Office of the Trustee, the Register of Deeds and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| If you check to see if they did more, you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| We're comparing apples with oranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| For instance, our clerks here, we make titles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| So we have to have more people now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| These other counties don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| They come in from these other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| The trustee, I believe you can talk to Mr. Ballard there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| He's running for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| I believe our trustee here in Knoxville does a little bit more work than the trustees in the other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| Is that not correct, Field?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| Well, I'm not running for trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| I mean, I'm sorry, you're property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Property assessor, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| I'm sorry, but you were right in talking about a lot of what the trustee was doing before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| But you know that they do do more work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| We do more work, and you haven't compared these things with any of these other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| Now, I don't understand how you got from 19 past the 17 to the 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3064)|
| 0:51:12| The only thing that I can see in this is that the fewer people that you people can elect, the more power a few people in Knox County can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3072)|
| 0:51:23| I've got a question, and then we're going to call on Mr. Davis and then this young lady and then back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| If more counties throughout the state or whatever had not had smaller legislative bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3090)|
| 0:51:40| but the counties that were like us, that had an elected county executive, county mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3100)|
| 0:51:47| as opposed to a hired county business manager or a hired county executive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| where basically the county commission hires the county mayor like the school board hires the school superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| then would that also stand to reason that there's an awful lot of counties out there that have small legislative bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3119)|
| 0:52:08| that actually hire the county mayor as opposed to folks that have an elected county mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| And the point I'm trying to make is that a county that's put together like that is going to be a very small county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3134)|
| 0:52:21| where zoning isn't going to exist at all. It's going to be just you build it, it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| They're not going to have the same kind of codes, if that's the kind of governance we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| Is that what we're talking about when we're talking about these small legislative bodies and hired executives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3151)|
| 0:52:38| What the Baker Center tried to do is find counties that were similar to us in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| And that's what they gave us as a comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| But the other thing that I would say is I think as a group, the reason that I came into this group and that I work for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3167)|
| 0:52:56| is because this is something that we have the right to review, as I said earlier, as a result of this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3176)|
| 0:53:03| I don't think this community ever realized that we had the right to review before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| And what I think is appropriate is that it be put out there for discussion and for consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| and that people are going to disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| I've had people that have come up to me and said, well, you know, I'm totally against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| Great. That's what we're talking about. That's why we're talking about it, to see what people think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| For the first time in this community, in a long time, we're talking about how we're organized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| what everybody does, and how we want to be organized in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| And what I wanted to say is for everybody to go out there, think about it, think about what they want, and for them to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3218)|
| 0:53:45| The first time that Commissioner Pinkston asked me a question about anything, and I hope he backed me up on this, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| he said, well, why would we want to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| And I said, I don't think everybody will want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| I think if they hear the reasons that we're behind bringing it forward, some people will agree with those reasons and they'll vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3236)|
| 0:54:04| And there are other people who are going to say, for example, with the fee offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| if you feel like the fact that you want the oversight of having that in the appointed office, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3248)|
| 0:54:16| but also the commission to be able to approve it, the commission to be able to approve the number of employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3256)|
| 0:54:23| and the salaries of those employees because they don't do that right now, then you might vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3263)|
| 0:54:29| If you say, no, I don't want to do this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| I want to be able to vote for that person myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| That's the most important thing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| Then you'll vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| But we put it out there for the people to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| You all have had a right to think about it and talk about it and decide which way you follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| And then you're going to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| Nothing will change unless the citizens of this community want to vote for it and want to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3287)|
| 0:54:53| Mr. Davis will stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| I'm going to stand up for this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| My name is Doug Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| My father is Rex Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| He served on the city council in the 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| At that time, the city council made $300 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| There's a big difference in public service and making public income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3308)|
| 0:55:15| It's a sacrifice to be an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| You've got to dedicate time and effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| But you've got to be prepared to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| If you're not prepared to do that, don't run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| It's a tough job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| It's a tough job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| We have death threats for some of the legislation my father did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| And I'm prepared for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3337)|
| 0:55:49| But let's get it down to where we don't keep doubling the size of our government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| because all of a sudden we've got more people up in the city county building than we have in our subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| I think you were next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| I just want to simplify it for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| Just down to earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| And I've got to say this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| This lady, I don't know who you are, and I'm not being disrespectful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| but you can talk longer without saying anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3376)|
| 0:56:34| And I have another statement I would like to make to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| Earlier you were talking about our taxes and how we're going to afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| I've got a simple suggestion for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| And it bothers me that people don't just come right out and just say it like plain English,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| that you and you and you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| And you can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| They want to take away your right to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| And can you imagine Mayor Ragsdale – oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| Back to the tax part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| Just take away Ragsdale's car rent, food allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| Our tax is $11,000 and we'll be just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| But as far as everything else goes, they just – I mean, can you imagine him appointing the Register of Deeds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3434)|
| 0:57:23| Can you just imagine in your wildest nightmare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| imagine Mike Ragsdale appointing anybody else for anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3447)|
| 0:57:37| And everybody here – I hope that everybody here that's concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| we're where we are now because people don't get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| They don't have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| I made the statement once that you couldn't shoot them out of the recliner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| That's about true, and I'm not being – I'm not trying to be rude or smart or cute or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3471)|
| 0:57:59| I'm just being honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| I really am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| People don't get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| They don't want to do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| Everybody says somebody else will do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| Back when Victoria and I and B and several people was trying to stop Ragsdale from taking over the public library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3487)|
| 0:58:15| which we don't have public – this is not a public library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| It's Ragsdale's library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| And see, and when we try to get people interested, Howard Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| there was even a young girl, I don't know her name, I called every news media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| I called every radio station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| I called – I left messages for Dave's phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| I called everybody that I could think of, and nobody would even call me back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| This was when we were trying – we was trying to get people to come to the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| Ragsdale said – and this goes back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| Ragsdale points to Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| Ragsdale's not going to point to you or you or you or me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| He does not want us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| He wants a Ragsdale person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| He wants somebody that he can take to clubs with him, and they'll do exactly what he tells them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3544)|
| 0:59:12| And I honestly can't believe that people that look like they're halfway intelligent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3552)|
| 0:59:22| I can't believe that you can just stand up and say all these things and mean it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3562)|
| 0:59:28| I mean, don't you realize they want to take away your right to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| Anytime you take anything out of the hands of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| and put it into one person's hands, most especially the county mayor, have we not been through enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3577)|
| 0:59:44| I mean, don't you understand that all that these huge, money people want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| they just want the right to appoint all these officers to take away your rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| And I hope that you'll call somebody and tell somebody, no matter who it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| and just say it in plain English, forget the runaround and all the clouding of the issue and muddy waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| Just simply say they want to take your right to vote, so just say no and stand together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| And if we don't, that's what they're going to do, and they'll do it any way they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| Victoria was next, and then you and then Roger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| Okay, I thought that Representative Dunn brought up a great point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| and I don't know if it was directly answered, his concern about these amendments appearing five and four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| Have they been removed from the Election Commission yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| There's an Election Commission meeting that's scheduled for Tuesday to ratify those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| and we've asked them to cancel that meeting in order for the Charter Review Committee process to play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| Okay, and I was going to follow up with that, because our charter does provide in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| it says that no ordinance or resolution shall become effective which embraces more than one subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3648)|
| 1:00:55| the subject to be expressed in its caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| And so that goes along with what they do at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| And so I just really question whether this review, this petition drive, if they even read our own charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3661)|
| 1:01:09| Okay, and then, you know, we do live in a republic, and I know and I'm really glad to hear all of you speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3669)|
| 1:01:18| and, you know, we do live in a democracy, but it's also a republic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| If you elect people, then we want to hear you, and I thank you for letting me speak, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| because I can't call these other commissioners on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| And so this helps us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| I'm not ready to touch that ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| And so I'm really, I'm serious, and I'm very grateful that we have opportunities like this to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| If you put us in a public office to restrict our freedom of speech, sir, we'd be devastated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| And you have a forum, and you have exercised your right at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| I live in this district, not in the district that you were appointed to represent, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3710)|
| 1:01:57| Now, what I would like, as far as the specific issue you were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| as far as the number of commissioners, I'm personally opposed to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| because I think the more commissioners, the more representative the commission would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| I don't think we live in a county that has the same population as it did 30 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| Obviously, we have grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| The Congress has grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| The Congress has grown because there's more states, there's more people who live in the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| And we don't want to have two or three people representing us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| if there's 100 of us as opposed to 20 of us, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| But I think it's important to have all of these things available to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3756)|
| 1:02:43| I think they need to be separated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| I think Bill's absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| They need to be addressed individually because I might be in favor of seven of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| but opposed strongly to one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| And I think that's probably true for a lot of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| And with all due respect to this issue of, well, you know, we don't want people to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| I want to be able to vote for these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| You're taking away my right to vote if you're saying, no, we're denying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080322?start=3791)|
