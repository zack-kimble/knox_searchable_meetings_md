| 0:05:27| emergency vehicles because right now we have an issue getting emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| vehicles into the park due to the congestion at that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=330)|

| 0:08:13| I'll make a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| There have been a number of public comments on this, many related to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| zoning of the property, many related to the sale of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=500)|

| 0:08:36| and I appreciate that as this commission has no, again, no purview over the sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| or disposal of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=522)|

| 0:11:56| I will go ahead and make the presentation with that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| First, I want to talk a little bit about the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| We're dealing with three lots on Fifth Avenue adjacent to Caswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| The public park became Caswell, was created in 1916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| It was updated with ball fields in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| At that time, the three-lot parcel was purchased for drainage and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| construction of an outfield fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| This intruded into a small portion along the north side of the parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| If this is approved subsequently, we will separate the outfield portion that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| within those parcels and put them within the confines of Caswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| Since that purchase, the city has mowed the lots as the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=753)|
| 0:12:40| responsible property owner, and a number of years ago, this was placed in open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| space zoning, so we are dealing with a present open space situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| Let's talk a minute about the project that drives this rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| for a bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| The Community Development Department was approached by VMC as a potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| site for permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| These supportive housing projects serve the neediest among us, as the name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| implies, provide services as well as housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| These are as challenging to fund and site, both because of cost and both in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| federal constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| Mayor O'Hara has placed a high priority on both affordable housing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| the challenge of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| This project is the intersection of both of those challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| These major challenges remain for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| This site has very well suited for the eventual use of permanent supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| housing, why it has a history of residential use and other use prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| structures being removed at the time of the purchase and the fence construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| It's within a block of a major bus line, and it's perfectly well suited, as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| as being in city ownership, the cost of land doesn't become part of the pro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| forma, which is awful challenging in the financing of such projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| Upon receiving that request, we immediately checked with the one-year and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| sector plans and found them to be suitable for multifamily designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| We also found that the city's Parks and Recreation Department, upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| consultation, had no plans for programming any park use here and did not consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| this to be part of a city park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| VMC, in fact, gave notice to the president of the Park Ridge Community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=864)|

| 0:14:35| September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| City Council was notified at its public meeting on May 7th of the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| intentions with regard to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| Timing here is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| The property must be in control of VMC by January 1st, 2020, to be eligible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| the tax credits necessary to make the project possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| Concern from some in the neighborhood about this is certainly understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| The city has mowed the lots next to the park and created a visual connection to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| The land is open space and, in fact, does serve as open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| The city has offered other locations for use to provide other open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| opportunities with the fact in mind that this would remove that open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| Also, concern from those who raise the issue that parkland is at stake is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| However, this is open space and it has not and has not been part of a city park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| This is a distinction with a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| Mayor Rajero, in her September letter to PCO President Lynn Rondazzo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| acknowledged that this was a choice that put two desirable outcomes in conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=940)|
| 0:15:47| In this case, the clear public interest is in rezoning the property to mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| for allow for the permanent supportive housing project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| Not only that, it is good planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| The uses are consistent with the publicly vetted sector and one-year plans, both in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=957)|
| 0:16:04| 2003, right after the park was remodeled and reopened, and more recently in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=964)|
| 0:16:12| The desired use is badly needed multifamily housing to serve the neediest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| among us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| Similar projects, which not only have been lifesavers for this vulnerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| population with no adverse impacts whatsoever on the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| We respectfully ask you to vote affirmatively in support of the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| So, I will stop here and yield any time for further response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| I do understand others want to speak in favor of this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=995)|

| 0:20:44| those elected to represent us and to the community at large is to find places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| throughout our community for the residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| Some have suggested concentration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| We believe that is not the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| Neighborhoods in the core of the city, Forth and Gill, Old North, Mechanicsville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| and Park Ridge have carried a disproportionate amount of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1262)|

| 0:21:18| Lyons, that concentrating poverty in East Knoxville is poor policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| The application before you today is so riddled with errors and the process to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1283)|

| 0:22:01| If you go to that filter on your map up there, you will see that the same MUCC4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1321)|

| 0:24:41| Becky Wade made an appalling point that it is just grass and not park because it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1481)|

| 0:24:52| If an argument is to be made that it's not as nice as other city parks, this speaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1492)|

| 0:28:08| fit what we could in the five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| I will say, like you, I have served at the request of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| I served on the City Greenways Commission for two terms, and my time on the Greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| Commission predates the current Parks and Recreation Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| It also predates the current Parks Coordinator, Tim Hester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| So I've studied greenways a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| I was part of the process where we actually came up with the comprehensive greenway plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| And I'll tell you something about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| That parcel, going back to 1998, the Caswell Park study done by the MPC, they said, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| we should put a greenway linkage between Caswell Park and Park Ridge Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| So putting in this development precludes the opportunity to have that greenway plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| The mayor's own First Creek example said they would put a greenway plan through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| And Director Green, I asked you a question that there is a standard of minimum parkland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| a national standard of minimum parkland per residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| And that question hasn't been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| Is the minimum standard of residential parkland being met if we're taking away parkland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| in a lower income neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| So when I hear that this isn't used as a park, it never was meant to be developed as a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| that's not true because we have plans that say that there should be, going back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| MPC's own studies in 1998, saying there should be a greenway linkage through this open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| linking Caswell Park to Park Ridge Park, the little neighborhood park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| Thank you for your service and thank you for considering our opposition today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1776)|

| 0:29:44| I'd just like to state, we urge you to just delay, we would ask you to just delay your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| decision on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| There's no need, reason to approve or reject this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| There is a lot of work that can be done to help everybody and get everybody on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1795)|
| 0:30:02| with this and move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| This is a not in my backyard, this is not a not in my backyard issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| We are not against supportive housing for the homeless by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| We just think that what is proposed here and in that space are too many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:19| And we think that there's better solutions for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1823)|
| 0:30:23| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| Lyons, would you like to be moved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| You have what, 30 seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1830)|
| 0:30:30| A minute and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| I'd like to address a few issues that were raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| First, I mean, we can quarrel about whether or not this is or is not part of Caswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| The city has never had it programmed or considered or portrayed or on its city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| map as part of Caswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| This was, these lots were in fact, as was pointed out by Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| Moyer, purchased with the intent of providing the outfield fence and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| drainage necessary for Caswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| But they, in fact, were a rezoned open space following the council designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| of that for all vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| And that's how that OS2 got applied there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| Second, we feel the process was perfectly adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| The neighborhood, the main neighborhood and the neighborhood represented here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| today was contacted in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| And Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Spangler did offer to meet with the board and with the entirety of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1888)|
| 0:31:35| community, if they so wished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| And there was a meeting, I believe, with the board in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| And we assume that board members and the leadership did inform all of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| members just as they did about the public meeting in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| So this is a very important decision that we think pits two interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| In this case, the open space, we think not part of the park versus the need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| comply with the one-year plan and comply as we've amended our request, it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| comply with the one-year plan and the sector plan, both the 2003 and 2014, both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| of whom were vetted through a thorough public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| So we're requesting that you vote in affirmative to keep this use, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| consistent with the long range zoning plans of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| I'm going to recognize Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| I see his light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| Hi, I'd like to use our other 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| Yeah, I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1955)|
| 0:32:35| I'm giving you your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| My name's Lynn Rondasso, 1800 Jefferson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| I'm the president of the Park Ridge Community Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| We were contacted by Bruce Spangler in March, April, met with him in May, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| then we informed our community what was going on in May, and that same month at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| a city council meeting, these changes were removed from the recode plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| In June, I followed up with Mayor O'Hara and asked, what are the plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| I did not hear back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| I followed up a week later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| I did not hear back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| I followed up in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| I did not hear back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| So at that time I contacted Becky Wade, who I did not hear back from, but a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| later finally did hear from Mayor O'Hara on September 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| This did not give us time to give our community notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| And why would we give them notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| As far as we understood, nothing was moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| Just wanted to correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Thank you for your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| Thank you, Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| And boy, these are never, never easy decisions for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| And I realize we have an opportunity to be very popular or very unpopular, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| please respect the fact that we take these cases very seriously and we basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2033)|
| 0:34:01| make our decisions on the information before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| And I have looked at this quite diligently and it appears to me, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2043)|
| 0:34:10| quite frankly, I would not have supported RP3 because I don't think we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| the authority to support RP3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| However, I don't see anywhere that RP1 is inconsistent with our one-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2056)|
| 0:34:24| plan or our general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| And for that reason, I would make a motion that we approve RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| Chair recognizes Commissioner Canty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| Yes, I heard the motion, but again, to Bill, I was going to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| most of these people want a postponement for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| Are you, I guess, is the, I know it's supposed, you want it to be done by a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2090)|
| 0:34:57| certain date, so what's the date again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| And what's the, I guess, is there any huge opposition from the city to, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2099)|
| 0:35:06| know, allow a postponement for more conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| Thank you, Commissioner Canty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| Oh, the date for the necessity of the VMCs having clear control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2112)|
| 0:35:19| of the land is January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| And for that, this needing two council votes, if this is delayed today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| we won't be able to meet that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| That's why we would strongly request that there is not the delay that all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| information needed is before you and has been publicly available as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| I second Commissioner Hill's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| And again, to reiterate, this is, it's not an easy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| I don't, I drove by the piece of property three times last week looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| I played football at Evan Collins Fields all my adult life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| I probably couldn't have supported RP3, but RP1 is well within the limits of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:11| it's, what it's supposed to be based on the plans that have been set out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2171)|
| 0:36:18| I think we've been really blessed with a city and a county leadership that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2178)|
| 0:36:26| recognize open, the need for open space and recognize the needs for parks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| recreations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| I'm think that we're getting close to having too much that we can't maintain it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| all and maintaining those fields and maintaining the parks is a huge expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| for the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| And we're getting to the point where the legacy costs of keeping those up, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| there's nothing better than a park and nothing worse than a deserted park full of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| trash and unkept playground equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| So those things have to be considered as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| There are expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| I think that the Park Ridge community is, based on the list of parks that I've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2227)|
| 0:37:14| I think is well served with parks and open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| Some places in Knoxville and Knox County are more, have more open space and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2237)|
| 0:37:24| park space, but I think Castle Park was a huge addition, positive addition to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| And I live close to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| I live in North Hills, so I'm close to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| And we, I think Park Ridge bears a lot of the responsibility for our underserved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2255)|
| 0:37:46| population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| I think they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2267)|
| 0:37:47| But also the people in Park Ridge are some of the most acutely aware of people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2267)|
| 0:37:56| need housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2276)|
| 0:37:56| They're some of the most generous people and genuine people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| The people in Park Ridge, we did, I think we tried to do a historic overlay and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| everybody was like, no, we want an interdispersed community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| If you do an overlay, people won't be able to afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| I'm not sure that that was right, but I heard a huge outcry from the people of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| So I think you bear your share and then some of our problem with homelessness and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| underserved people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| But if it continues to be a problem, your neighborhood will probably be the one most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| impacted as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| I think we ought to push it out to other places as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| Nine years ago, there was a case that came before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| It was called Flinnican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| It was an old school in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| And I voted against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| I listened to the, back when we could go and talk to neighbors and neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| without being conflicted with our job, I talked to several of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| And they convinced me that it wasn't a good thing to have homeless people and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| this alternate housing in that building in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| And I voted against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| It got passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| City Council passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| And I was invited to the finished product from, I think it's Legacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2346)|
| 0:39:12| Foundation, one of the foundations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| And it's a huge success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| It took a building that was so blighted that it should have been torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2356)|
| 0:39:23| They took it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2363)|
| 0:39:23| They renovated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| The neighborhood has meeting space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| They have, the people there are actually getting a second chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| And their success rate in Flinnican is unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| So it's not a negative thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| I don't think you're losing a lot of park space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| I think Castle Park, it's a beautiful facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| My son plays softball there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| I think we're in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| And I hate to go against the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| I know the people in Park Ridge are passionate about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| But we do have to look at what's best for everybody and how that all pans out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| And that's all I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| Chair recognizes Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| Thank you, Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| First of all, I just want to say a big thank you to all of you that have come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| probably missed work, and you've come here to support your neighborhood and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| support this issue and speak out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| And like the other two commissioners, I honestly didn't sleep much last night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2422)|
| 0:40:29| because of this case, because I know it is so important to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| However, I am happy that it's going to go to RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2433)|
| 0:40:42| I was struggling a little bit with the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| I do have a question for Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| In relation to this neighborhood and surrounding neighborhoods, I know this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| is probably, you know, you might not have that information right at your fingertips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| but could you kind of tell us how many parks there are, or at least give us some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2460)|
| 0:41:09| sort of idea, the amount of parks that is already supporting this neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| I'm going to ask Ms. Albertson, or whoever's in control of the computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| to pull out on Mr. Reynolds, now, whoever, Ms. Portia, Taryn, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2480)|
| 0:41:27| We passed this around to zoom out and show the existing land uses so that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2493)|
| 0:41:33| I don't have the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| Early in my career, I did some recreation parks planning and knew the ratio of so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| many acres of park land to population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| I don't know that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| I do know that there was a survey done by a national organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| I don't think it was National Recreation Parks Administration that I received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| that showed the well-served and the level of service of provision of parks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| open space by neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| East Knoxville was well-served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| What struck me was that East Knoxville was well-served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| West Knoxville was well-served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| South Knoxville was medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| North Knoxville, north of North Hills, was underserved, the most underserved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| portion of the city in terms of having parks and open space is North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| You're saying this area is well-served?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| Well-served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:24| If you look at the map up there now, the green shows parks and open space in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:30| East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| I do have a more direct answer than Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| We actually have everything on the north side of Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| Could you state your name, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2561)|
| 0:42:41| I'm James Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| Just real quick because we've already gone beyond the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2565)|
| 0:42:45| I just want to point out that we've already calculated that in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| and we have approximately six usable acres that you don't have to cross| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| Magnolia to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| And your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| James Waldrop, 1710 East 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| Thank you for your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| I think this is a tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| I think we need both homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| Housing is so important, but open parks are important, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| And I just wanted to add that I think it's important for us to have unprogrammed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| parks and parks that aren't fenced and aren't ball fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| And so that's why I hate to see the loss of this particular park because it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| just, it is accessible all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| But I understand at the same time the need for the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| Commissioner Camp, do you have any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| Your light is on, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| Yes, just one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| So this is probably for Bill again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| I get the importance of the area given that it's within the bus line and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| Has there been any other areas considered for this or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| I'm trying to see if there's, I get what people are saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2633)|
| 0:43:59| widened area, but also it's so close to so many resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| I was trying to get, well, one widened area and has there been any other areas considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2644)|
| 0:44:12| Well, the way this entire program works, you can think of both Flanagan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| Minn Villa, is we are approached by folks like BMC with the capacity to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| together a proposal and they saw this as very suitable land for their proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| So at the meeting that our folks here were in attendance that we had a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2667)|
| 0:44:34| of weeks ago, a number of places, one in Caswell Park at what's now the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| lay down yard was suggested, another at what's in the 500-year flood plain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| which is now occupied by the pension office brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| We did take a look at those and those could never surpass the bar that's set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| by the federal government for both noise, distance from railroad tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| flood plain, and others, and distance from public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| But this land is very suitable partially because the city does own it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| which means the cost is negligible, which means the project is actually possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| It's still a very expensive project to conduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| So this isn't something that the city goes looking for a place and then puts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| out an RFP for a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2716)|

| 0:45:27| appreciate Bruce Spangler and people at BMC and others who have taken on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| projects to identify a site that they know, in conjunction with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2731)|

| 0:45:45| for making it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| So that's why this location is being at the heart of this request because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2746)|
| 0:45:53| the request from the developer is a place they can actually make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| project work and there are very few of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2756)|

| 0:46:17| Commissioner Hill, I would ask that we modify your motion to include the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2777)|
| 0:46:25| This is RP1 and we need to put a maximum density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2785)|
| 0:46:29| I'll make a motion for RP1 up to 24 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2789)|
| 0:46:37| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2797)|

| 0:46:43| The motion on the floor is by Commissioner Hill, seconded by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| Commissioner Clancy, to approve RP1 to a density of not to exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2806)|

| 0:46:55| For the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2817)|

| 0:47:13| The subdivision is Dorchester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2833)|

| 0:47:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2869)|
| 0:48:13| Again, this is item number 38 and the subdivision is Dorchester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| The applicant is Masana Investments, LLC, located on the west side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2898)|

| 0:48:41| Number of lots is 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| There are four variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| Staff recommendation, and there's two motions, approve variances one through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| four, because the existing access strip and site conditions restrict compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| with the subdivision regulations and the proposed variances will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| The other motion is to approve the concept plan subject to 11 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2951)|
| 0:49:11| Brachko, would you like to make a comment on this question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| Just briefly, this staff recommendation has not changed since last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| This was postponed at the request of the adjoining neighborhoods, given an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| opportunity for them to meet with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| My understanding is they have had a meeting and you have actually a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| in the blue sheets, a summary from the neighborhood, from Alicia's Vineyard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| that meeting, but staff, again, recommendation is unchanged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| Brachko.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2988)|
| 0:49:48| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| Applicant, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| Would you like the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| Opposition, you have five minutes to speak, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| If there's someone else interested in speaking, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| You said five minutes, but there's another group here that has nothing to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| the Carpenter Road residents' concerns and it's the Alicia Vineyard's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| I have four minutes, 15 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3011)|

| 0:50:19| Can we please extend the two minutes, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| There's a total of seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3023)|
| 0:50:24| There's a total of seven minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3024)|

| 0:50:37| As such, we are seriously concerned about Knox County's willingness to grant the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| variances and the waivers, which in our opinion will further create unsafe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| conditions on a rural road with already existing safety issues, specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3047)|
| 0:50:53| reducing the corner radius for the right-of-way at the intersection of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| Carpenter and the proposed subdivision entrance and exit from the required 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| feet to zero and the corner radii directly impact vehicles turning into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3062)|
| 0:51:09| and out of the proposed subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3069)|

| 0:51:15| They're recommending variances or waivers in variances in three places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3075)|
| 0:51:21| on the road, one by 40% and two by 30% each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| Now this is when you have the transition in roads that allows a vehicle to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| negotiate a turn at a gradual rate rather than a sharp cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| And they also some waivers as requiring that the entrance exit road into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| subdivision be reduced from 26 feet to 20 and also the street pavement for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3100)|

| 0:52:09| reduced, especially when you take into account the pedestrians who actually use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3129)|

| 0:52:30| made more hazardous by these variances and waivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| None of the statutes for safe road travel seem to matter when it comes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3154)|

| 0:53:17| Traffic has increased in the surrounding area due to the number of subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3197)|

| 0:54:02| The statistics will not get better on Carpenter when Knox County keeps granting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| variances and waivers for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| I have always viewed Knox MPC as basically a caretaker of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| However, by your process of granting waivers and variances, safety is reduced in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3259)|

| 0:55:09| You make the variance knowing they've made these waivers, so they go together in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| safety on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| Before we hear the next comment, I want to point out that I failed to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| There were three motions on this particular item, and the third is to approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| development plan for up to 70 detached dwellings on the individual lots and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| requested reduction of the peripheral setback to 20 feet as identified on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| concept plan subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| So I just want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3341)|
| 0:55:41| Give me your name and your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| John Jahowski.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| I'm from 7545 Napa Valley Way, which is one of the roads on the north perimeter of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3345)|
| 0:55:51| the Alicia Vineyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| So I'll be directly impacted by the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| I have had some conversations with, or at least messages with, Scott Davis, and he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3358)|
| 0:56:09| been very forthwith and very helpful in addressing our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| We have not come to an agreement yet, but I think we've gotten the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3374)|
| 0:56:21| We sent out a flyer to all of our residents and got 58 of nearly 70 of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3381)|
| 0:56:28| residents to reply, all of them which indicated we needed to have a barrier on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| our north perimeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| There is a history here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| Our construction developer and Scott Davis's company had another subdivision on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3398)|
| 0:56:49| the east northeast side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| During the period of construction, there was some transfer of people and materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3412)|
| 0:56:58| between the two where things were stolen, and so they erected a fence and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| controlled that at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| That fence did not extend to the north because we were told at the time that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| not going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| I think there's a statement in your premises that say that this would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3432)|
| 0:57:21| adversely affect the value of the properties, and I object to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| I think our properties will be devalued if these were constructed, especially if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| setback was reduced to 20 feet because there is a steep slope behind the houses on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3451)|
| 0:57:37| the Napa Valley way that lead up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| So at 20 feet, those houses will be built right at the edge of that slope, and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3460)|
| 0:57:47| they put a deck on it, they would actually extend into the slope above those houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| So even if we constructed a fence, it would have to be abnormally high in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| to actually be effective as far as for site and privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3478)|
| 0:58:05| The homes in Alicia Vineyard are end homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| These are where people have worked their entire lives, have built their families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3488)|
| 0:58:15| and have moved there looking to have a safe and settled place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| They've invested their savings into these houses, and I think putting a much lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3500)|
| 0:58:30| valued homes adjacent to us is going to adversely affect our values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| And we were, again, I do think that Mr. Davis and Mr. Disney have replied, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3515)|
| 0:58:45| they gave us a reply yesterday, which gave us no time to actually look at that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| So we're asking for an additional 30-day extension so that we can continue and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| hopefully come to a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| We would like to see the neighborhoods coexist if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| Thank you, Mr. Gnatsky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| The applicant, you have seven minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3546)|
| 0:59:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| Drew Statton, Masana Investments, P.O. Box 11315, Knoxville, Tennessee 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| Again, we want to thank the opposition for their willingness and cooperativeness in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| helping kind of try to come to a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| I know sometimes that can be hard to come by, so we do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| And I'll try to address the opposition points the best I can here, so bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| As far as the Carpenter Road residents, we've agreed to the requested improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3574)|
| 0:59:39| on Carpenter Road itself, and we also did get our site surveyor out to confirm that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| we will have, be able to achieve the adequate site distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| And so we believe those two can go hand in hand with mitigating the traffic and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| risk concerns there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| And then kind of switching over, again, Mr. Davis did meet with the homeowners and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3594)|
| 1:00:01| was very pleased with the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| And he also spoke with Mr. Disney, who is the developer of Alicia's Vineyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| directly south of this property, as they mentioned, and are very agreeable to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| putting up a barrier, especially a fence, because that was the consensus of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| And they, again, like he said, Mr. Davis replied, and so we can come to a solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| I guess, farther outside of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| And another small tidbit I'd like to mention regarding the 20-foot setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| peripheral setback, Alicia's Vineyard is a 15-foot setback, and those are attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3631)|
| 1:00:38| homes, and we are seeking a 20-foot, so five foot longer or more, for single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:45| family detached homes, so much less cluster and much less noise in that, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| guess, in the end of those yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| Appreciate your time and service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Thank you, Mr. Hatton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| Mr. Brachko.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| Just responding on a couple items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| On the variance issues, the only variance that kind of possibly impacts the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3663)|
| 1:01:10| external portion of the property is that one on the reduction from 25 foot to zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| on the corner radiuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| However, that is only for right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| The property owner does not own the adjoining property, so they're not able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| provide the 25-foot right-of-way radiuses, but the design of the road includes a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| 25-foot curb radius, so they will be meeting that requirement for vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3690)|
| 1:01:37| access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| The horizontal curb variances, the three that are listed, are internal to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3698)|
| 1:01:44| subdivision, and based on the loop layout within the subdivision, they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| providing whatever slight distance easements through the curbs there, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| also helps to, that and the design of being a narrow road, slow down traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3713)|
| 1:01:59| internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| But the conditions of part of the approval include, again, paving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| Carpenter Road to 18-foot width from the entrance south to the Carpenter Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| subdivision where improvement was made from Emory to that entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| They will be widening that road to 18 feet as far as additional pavement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| width there, and also the slight distance was the other safety issue that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| addressed by the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| And on the issue of the peripheral setback, that is a setback that the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| Commission has the authority to approve or deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| The requirement is 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| I've asked for a reduction to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| As the comment was made, Alicia Vineyards on their approved plan had a 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| I believe the units are probably closer to 30, 35 feet that they do have enclosed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| porches or that extend back probably closer to the 15-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3775)|
| 1:03:01| Mr. Breschke, what was the reasoning for reducing the setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| Is there a justification for from 35 to 20, or just is it the preference of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| Well, it's the preference of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| They had actually, this is the third time that this concept has been before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3792)|
| 1:03:18| Planning Commission, and they had requested it in the previous and was approved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| previous approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| The depth of the lots that back up to Alicia Vineyards is about 115 feet, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3804)|
| 1:03:31| requested to, it's probably better for them to address the reason for that, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| gives them a little more flexibility in unit placement on those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| Commissioner Cathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| I think I'm fine, but to the lady in opposition earlier, did you need more time, or are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3824)|
| 1:03:51| okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| No, I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| Commissioner Boston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| Mr. Breschke, thank you, thank you, Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| There was an issue about which, where the sidewalks were going to be placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| I think, has that been resolved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| I got an email, I can't find it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| That's probably the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| There are sidewalks proposed within this development, within the loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| And Mr. Davis is fine with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| Well, we had actually recommended sidewalks, and they gave us a revised plan that included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| them in the Dorchester plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| We were told by the developer that there would be no sidewalks when we had a meeting with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3866)|
| 1:04:37| Mr. Davis on the 24th of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3878)|

| 1:04:47| The fact that they're going to widen the road from here down to the next, anything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| widens Carpenter Road, it's skinny, tiny, and scares me to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3892)|

| 1:05:06| And I don't, you know, this was kind of the home place, and I don't like seeing it go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| to a development, but it's a matter of property owners' rights and land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3911)|

| 1:05:44| You've got to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| So I'm going to make a motion that we approve variances one through four, the existing access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=3948)|

| 1:08:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| Again, Drew Statton, PO Box 11385, Knoxville, Tennessee 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4119)|
| 1:08:45| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| I know it's been a long one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| It's just to condition number three, so I guess line item three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| If there was a disconnect during this developer review meeting, we apologize on our end, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| it was our understanding following the meeting that the sidewalks, either internal or on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| the Hitchin Post Road frontage, was more of a one or the other situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4142)|
| 1:09:07| We're agreeable to one or the other, not both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| We believe that, as well as I believe the Knox County Engineering felt it would probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| be more beneficial to this proposed subdivision, the adjacent subdivision, to have the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4154)|
| 1:09:20| along the Hitchin Post frontage, especially given the vicinity to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| So I just wanted to clarify that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| And I'll try to add to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| The approval as recorded by the Planning Commission for the rezoning of this did not have a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4171)|
| 1:09:37| for sidewalks attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| The rezoning approval by the County Commission had the condition attached of sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4179)|
| 1:09:45| It's not clear where that sidewalk is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| We would defer to the recommendation or the request from Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4188)|
| 1:09:57| that it be on Hitchin Post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| That would allow connectivity to sidewalks on Shod Road and probably better serve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| And I believe, if I understood Mr. Stanton, you wanted one or the other, not both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| And I think that would not only address your concern, but also provide better service to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| the community and meet the intent of the County Commission that they just said a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4216)|
| 1:10:22| They weren't real clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| And I think that was a long evening also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| And I can't remember which commissioner at the County Commission made that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| I think it was Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| I think this would meet the intent of the County Commission also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| Is there a motion, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| There's no opposition, I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the concept plan subject to the nine conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4242)|

| 1:12:51| Very briefly on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4371)|

| 1:13:55| This is the Planning Commission's annual report and I'll turn it over to Gerald for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4435)|

| 1:14:09| Counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| It's been a long afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| I'll be fairly quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| I do have talking points here from the annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| So I'll go over those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| The major takeaway in the annual report is that we've tried to increase the outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4459)|
| 1:14:26| to the community through a number of methods, improved website, our story maps, we've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4466)|
| 1:14:36| a greater outreach with public meetings trying to go to different places, different times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| and we've succeeded in that both with the update of the zoning code, our Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4481)|
| 1:14:49| mobility plan, the Chapman Highway implementation study, the John Zavier Scenic Highway border| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4489)|
| 1:14:56| plan where we found that ice cream, free ice cream was a great incentive to get people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| to come out on Sunday afternoons to public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| We also have some additions to staff over the past years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| Laura Edmonds who works with you quite a bit, Kelly Byard who helps with our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4509)|
| 1:15:16| Savannah Robertson who does the smart traps and a number of other items in the transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| planning division, Michelle who's added greatly to the success of our meetings or maybe the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4521)|
| 1:15:28| length of them, and Lindsey Crockett who's our historic preservation planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4528)|
| 1:15:37| We also, you met Aubrey, she's actually in, will be reported in the next annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4537)|
| 1:15:44| We've done better signs, you notice our signs, we think they're a great deal better at providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4544)|
| 1:15:51| information to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| We've reconfigured it with our new office space, we have an emphasis on customer service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| and that's worked well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| We've created ground breakers, I don't know how many of you have looked at the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| breakers app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| You need, we'll send that to you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| It tracks all the development activity in the county and we actually received a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4567)|
| 1:16:13| yesterday from a marketing firm in Atlanta telling us what a great job our staff does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4573)|
| 1:16:19| that and the information we provide is better than any other agency or organization they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| It made us feel real good about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| We've had a number of major projects this year, you've approved, recommended approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| of two of them today, the Heart Valley Mobility Plan and the Chapman Highway Implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4593)|
| 1:16:40| Strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| The new zoning ordinance was a significant undertaking and who knows where that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| I hope we just continue to see it as our new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4607)|
| 1:16:52| I will state that we're trying to keep track of the activity with the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4612)|
| 1:16:58| So far it's been positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| I think today you did do one comparable zone where it went from Rn4 to Rn5, Rn4 was comparable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4619)|
| 1:17:08| to the existing zoning but we were kind to the new owner of the property and decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| on Rn4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| We have another one coming up where city council recommended Rn4 for a piece of property that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4634)|
| 1:17:19| had been industrial and the owners want IMU and we may talk them into another thing they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| want to do craft industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| Something that is attached to the annual report and came in a bit late is our annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| financial statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| We did well again this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| There were some items, federal, now be quiet over there you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4654)|
| 1:17:43| We handle a lot of federal grants and there was some duration in those but our fees and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4663)|
| 1:17:49| charges which we rely on for an important part of our funding is actually above our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4669)|
| 1:17:56| budgets, about $16,000 above the budgeted amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| We didn't spend as much as we took in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| We had our fund balance increases and it reminds me of when I had my own business, unlike most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4684)|
| 1:18:11| city departments, if you have a fund balance it just disappears and goes back to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4691)|
| 1:18:16| or the county at the end of the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| We get to keep hours to do things like our office renovations, new equipment, tablets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| for the computers for the planning commissioners, maybe some additional training and activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| for you in the coming years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| We try to use that money efficiently and we have to keep a certain amount in our fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| balance because we do work with federal grants and we have to be able to pay money before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4715)|
| 1:18:42| we get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4722)|
| 1:18:43| Often these are reimbursement grants and we have to be able to pay that money before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| Raises for the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| We mentioned that and I think Commissioner Crowder brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| I thought the extra desserts was the payback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| That is the pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| That is the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| I ate my share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4742)|

| 1:19:08| I sure have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| It was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| That was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| That was passed in the first 15 minutes of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| That was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| The C beside it on the agenda means it's a consent item, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4753)|
| 1:19:27| Smart Hospitality LLC, Number 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4767)|
| 1:19:38| Yes, sir, and that was read as one of the items on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| And that was approved with that discussion as part of the overall consent agenda at the beginning of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| It was approved when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| At the beginning of the meeting as part of the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| I've been here all the time. I never heard it came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| It was read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4797)|
| 1:20:03| It was number 45 when they did the consent, that big long list of things that went on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4803)|
| 1:20:10| They read a lot of the numbers about most, about three-fourths of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4810)|
| 1:20:16| It was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| And they said before they read it, they said, listen carefully because once these are passed, they won't be discussed again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4818)|
| 1:20:24| They'll be passed as a group lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| And they were passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| And 1215 Everett Road, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4828)|

| 1:20:39| And I guess I have got education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| But I was up here 25 years ago for this same piece of property when it was put up for a mulching company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4842)|
| 1:20:53| And they agreed that they would give them a six-month trial period because it was on agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4853)|
| 1:21:03| And they would notify me when the six-month was up if they were going to approve it for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4863)|
| 1:21:15| Well, it's been over 25 years, and I haven't heard from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part2?start=4875)|
