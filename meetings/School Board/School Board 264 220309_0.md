| 0:09:24| So, Commissioner Jay, I believe you are up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=564)|
| 0:09:32| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| My name is Larson Jay, and I'm an at-large Knox County Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| Thank you all on the Board for the opportunity to address you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| I've come before you today to ask you to change a long-held practice by the Knox County school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| and to consider a new way to support the children and teachers that you represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| that you represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| For a little over a year, I have been helping several of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| our community schools raise money to replace their aged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| and dilapidated playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| Recently, I visited Sunnyview Primary School, where I met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| principal Upton and PTA champion Brandi Pressley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| And what I saw absolutely shocked me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| The playground was extremely old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| Several parts had already been condemned and removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| Other areas were soon to fall apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| And the surrounding path and blacktop was cracked and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| deteriorating quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Quite frankly, I left feeling very pitiful and thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| boy, is this school neglected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| I've seen this before when helping Mount Olive Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| replace their playground, and again, when raising money for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| new Hopeville Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| More disturbing than the condition of the playgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| was the response each principal received when asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| Knox County Schools for a new playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| They were essentially told, it's on you and the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| to replace it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| You see, there's been a longstanding practice that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| Knox County Schools doesn't replace old playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| Knox County Schools doesn't even pay for and install new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| playgrounds at their brand new schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| It's on the PTA and on the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| Knox County School places this burden on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=662)|
| 0:11:02| We tax the citizenry to provide for services, one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| the most important being in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| And then when an element of that education fails, we tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| them again and place the burden of playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| replacement on communities who have already given so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| We would never adopt the same practice with a gymnasium or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| cafeteria, so why should Knox County Schools neglect their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| outdoor playgrounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| I know some might say that playgrounds are an option and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| not an institutional requirement, that they aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| an essential function of education, but I disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| Having the outdoor playground, a play space, and programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| time for children to be outside supports unstructured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| imaginative play without a screen to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| The sharing of space where children learn how to share,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| an environment to play with other kids who don't look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| them or have different abilities, areas to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| cognitive capacity, problem solving and decision making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| and activities that help curb childhood obesity and tamper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| behavioral anxiety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| I could go on and on, but most of you are parents or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| grandparents, and you know what it means for a child to run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| and play, what it means for a parent or teacher to see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| joy and to have just a little break in their day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| Not only does this practice of requiring the community to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| replace playgrounds financially impact thousands of families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| struggling to keep up with the rising costs and family bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| but it adversely impacts some of our most impoverished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| communities where even raising a modest amount of extra funds is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| an extraordinary burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| I dug more into this practice with the help of many of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| several, several of your KCS administration members, and so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| naturally started at the beginning, and I asked to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| the policy outlining where Knox County Schools doesn't replace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| However, there isn't one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| There never was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| While there's been a long-held practice, it predates all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| your administrative team, and it's been going on for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| To ensure a safe environment, Knox County Schools does have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| playground inspector, and this person checks each playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| two times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| If a playground gets really bad, then they write up a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| suggesting repairs, and they can also condemn or remove broken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| sections or parts of an old playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| This is a necessary function that I think should continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| but it needs another element to complement the safety of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| children, proper equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| Back to fundraising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| I've also asked for more information about how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| community groups have raised money to replace their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| playgrounds, and the numbers were absolutely staggering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been raised by communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=805)|

| 0:13:42| When replacement was the only option, they were informed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=822)|

| 0:15:08| initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| Right now, they're in the planning stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| And then because of where we are in our world, Chilhowee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| Intermediate raised $50,000 to put their playground together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| But then given the time it took to complete that fundraising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| goal, prices went up from the vendor and they had to raise an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| additional $15,000 and are still $3,000 short of their current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=924)|

| 0:15:38| The Knox County Schools Finance Department representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| have researched this issue for me and determined that each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| individuals supporting schools with playgrounds raise and spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| in excess of $300,000 each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| Imagine what those funds could do to help our teachers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| their classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=953)|

| 0:16:00| are several in immediate need of replacement and several others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| that need to be repaired or enhanced with more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=963)|

| 0:16:20| Knox County Schools, here's my very specific ask of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| Direct your operations team to quickly do an assessment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| every playground and find a logical way to prioritize them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| according to need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Focus on the worst playgrounds first, then work your way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| through the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Allocate real, substantial, and immediate ESSER III funding to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| make a decision today to fix the playgrounds as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| I've researched and verified this and checked with your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| finance department, and indeed, you can file an amended plan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| use federal ESSER III funds for playground replacements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| What a great way to use these funds for one-time playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| replacement or upgrade projects and help children get outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| more and play and engage with each other in a safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1023)|

| 0:17:07| elements they want to fit within their playground space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| And for those communities that have already raised funds or are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| in the process of raising funds now, tell them Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| Schools will replace or upgrade their playgrounds for them and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| that they should use those community dollars, those donated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| funds, to support their teachers who definitely need more wind in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| their sails right now after a hard couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| Or book field trips or find other ways to make their schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| Now, I know by Knox County Schools taking on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| initiative, it will mean standardizing playgrounds and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| offering more of a standard Chevrolet model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| And if communities want to upgrade that to a Tesla, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| can certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| But it will at least put everybody at the same starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| line, and it will catch up with 30 or 40 years of neglect all in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| a short amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Then, after every playground is replaced or upgraded to a level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| that you would be proud of, adjust your capital budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| immediately to maintain outdoor playgrounds and replace the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| mulch, keep them up to a standard worthy of our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| and don't put that burden on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Right now, you have the opportunity to change a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| longstanding practice of double-taxing our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| endorse the idea that outdoor play is important to childhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| development, support our teachers, and so much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| Show the community that outdoor play spaces are important to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| school board, and please show this community that a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| culture is forming within Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| Thank you for your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| Thank you, Mr. O'Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| Ms. Baird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Yeah, Mr. O'Day, I mean, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| I mean, I'd like your suggestion about the ESSER funding, but as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| you know, that's a one-time funding, and playgrounds are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| a one-time fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| So you are on county commission, and, you know, when we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| funding, we do have to look at long-term when we do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| either our budget goes up or we reallocate money from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| classroom to playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| I mean, do you have any thoughts on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| Yeah, first and foremost, I think that you have 30 or 40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| years to catch up on, and we know that we have two school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| systems that have been merged into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| A lot of these playgrounds are kind of the old city schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| that have really gone downhill, but there's others across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| You have an opportunity with ESSER to catch up on day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| That is one-time funding, one-time investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| It'll last for 20 or 30 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| Now, a playground will last for 20 or 30 years, depending on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| what type of installation you get, but that will catch you up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| to today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Going forward with maintenance, I do think it should be part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| I do think it should be part of using your reserve funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| putting it into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| I mean, the idea that we're asking the community to buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| mulch and to go and spread it, sometimes it's just dropped off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| and they have to do it themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| It just seems a little absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Will it become a part of the budget eventually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| You bet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Do I think that the benefits outweigh the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| And do I think that you could catch up with a lot of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| costs using federal funds that are at your disposal today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| You bet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| This is a topic that I have addressed with staff quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| and I think there may be some information that needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| Mr. Oaks, can you talk to us about when we're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| building a school, what we put in for playgrounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| If I remember correctly, the only thing we've done with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1216)|
| 0:20:29| playgrounds is and we haven't built that many new elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| We have built some replacement elementary schools and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| been equipment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| schools and there's been equipment there. What we do when we are at a school or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| we're building a school, if we have to move a playground or destroy a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| playground, we cover the cost of that and we're going to have to do some of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| coming up. If it's an entirely new school, we have not funded playgrounds. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1256)|
| 0:21:03| about ten years ago, I think when we did North Shore, the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| might have directed, it seems like I want to say $10,000 or something to go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| the account. I think the term he used was seed money to help the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| community get started on doing those playgrounds. Thank you. So to clarify, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| we have a building, let's say like Enskip, where our addition took over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| playground, then in that situation we would cover the playground. But if it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1293)|

| 0:21:42| recent years, yes ma'am. Thank you. Can I ask a quick question? Is there money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| budgeted? We have a new Northwest Elementary School that is brand new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| without an existing footprint. Is there a school, is there a playground budgeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| for that school? That's not in the scope of that project at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1314)|
| 0:22:03| Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Commissioner Jay. I appreciate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| bringing the issue. As I was touring some schools across different districts, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| was a common theme. It wasn't asked, it's just something as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| asked administrators in different districts, what are some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| challenges, that was something that was consistently brought up. And I'll tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| you, being a parent in Knox County Schools for the last 17 years, I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| know of that practice until I came on school board. So my guess is the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1345)|
| 0:22:32| public probably is not, unless they happen to be at a school who's trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| raise money for a playground, right? So I appreciate you bringing that issue. Also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| too, as we have worked on our strategic plan, especially around increasing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| health of school culture, and we've tried to become more trauma-informed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| trauma-responsive in our practice, if anybody has studied that issue very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| you know how important movement is, especially for kids who have experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| trauma. And so again, I appreciate you raising the issue, and I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| the challenge to the board to get creative about it. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1382)|
| 0:23:09| Any more questions? All right, thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1389)|

| 0:27:52| Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Cox, I'm wondering if you could speak to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| part of this. I know last year when the board approved the contract with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| Talking Point software and I've heard some feedback in the community since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| then about how important and valuable that has been to certain communities. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| just want to make sure that people understand that by doing this we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1689)|

| 0:28:20| language translation was really important when we approached this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| contract, so we wanted to make sure that we called out in the RFP the specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| languages in our communities that we wanted to ensure were covered and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| also learned from the Talking Points how valuable that tool can be to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| teachers, so we wanted that to reach all the way down into the classroom with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| high-quality translation. Looking at Parent Squared and looking at Talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1720)|

| 0:28:57| additional, you know, features that they feel are proprietary, but we do feel that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| this is a high-quality tool for our families and our teachers. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1742)|

| 0:31:35| criminal order to mask them, it's humiliating, it's bad for them socially, psychologically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1895)|
| 0:31:44| emotionally, and I frankly I don't have a lot of confidence in the new superintendent who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1904)|
| 0:31:53| elected for him saying, you know, yes it's for people having choice with the mask, but at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1913)|

| 0:32:07| I don't have any confidence in the new upcoming superintendent when he says that after six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1927)|
| 0:32:14| seven months of languishing here with this mask mandate. 60,000 students, 60,000 students with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1934)|
| 0:32:22| no voice, no voice. I'm speaking for them and coercion is not consent. When we had the mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1942)|
| 0:32:31| option, over 95% from what I saw in the schools chose not to wear a mask. So to tell me that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1951)|
| 0:32:38| isn't coercion is a lie. These people are held hostage, 60,000 students, 60,000 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=1958)|

| 0:33:51| it is an important tool in our toolbox and something that can hopefully save us funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| from being spent on additional frivolous lawsuits. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| All right. And next we have Kaitlyn Jones. State your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2040)|
| 0:34:13| Same thing for you. Would you like to use your whole time or split your time? I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| Use your whole time. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| I had little of no intentions of coming here today to speak about the masks, but here I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| I've spoken before to this board on numerous occasions and you are aware of the regression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| in Alec's speech and education since the mask mandate. When Alec was in Cedar Bluff preschool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| his teachers wore face shields or clear masks because they agreed it was needed for him to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| communicate. This is my six year old's face on February 24th. I picked him up from the daycare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2079)|
| 0:34:46| with a black eye. He did not have it when I dropped him off at school and somehow no one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| knows where he got it from. This happened just days after I spoke with his teacher and he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| informed that he was sewing toys. I asked for his teachers to wear face shields so that Alec could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| see their facial expressions. Today we had an IEP meeting to talk about his teachers getting an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| exemption. In this meeting, they clearly already made up their minds on the outcome because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| asked if I was going to record the meeting in which I responded no, which was clearly my mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| and I won't make that again. One of his teachers agreed that there are times that he has to pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| his face mask down and give Alec directions in order for Alec to look at him and understand him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| His other teacher also admitted that this was happening and that she uses body language and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| hand gestures to get him to do what she's asked. His speech therapist also said that she has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| pull her face mask down in order for Alec to see her mouth and articulation during therapy. So why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| if they all agree with everything that I have said, was Alec denied a reasonable accommodation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| today when I asked his teachers to wear face shields? I was told it was because of the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| Then I was told it was because they have no data showing his learning or safety had been impacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| although I don't know how they would know that because they've practically been in masks since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| the beginning of the school year and they have been in masks since Alec has been at Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| Since his teachers were able to wear clear masks in preschool, what possible data could they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| to show that it's not being impacted right now? Then I was told his behavior was not any worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2166)|
| 0:36:13| However, both the daycare, myself, my mom, my grandmother, anyone around him can clearly see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| that since he transferred from ALLots, his behavior has declined. So if the only place that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| he is a behaved child is at school, then I would love to know what magical potion they are using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| to make him behave. I told the IEP team that Alec's pediatrician and specialists at the Down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| Syndrome Clinic in Vanderbilt could verify the regression and that he has suffered due to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| fact that we are wearing face masks and was still denied the exemption. Alec has the right to safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| and productive education and the disgusting discrimination that the school system has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| to him is enough to drive anyone crazy. I have tried to be appropriate. I have tried to be nice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| but my son comes home with a black eye because he threw a toy and couldn't understand the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| parameters from his teacher because he couldn't see her face, his face, wherever it happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| because no one knows. Alec has the right to an education. He has the right to understand and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2227)|
| 0:37:14| safety. Why did the plaintiffs in this case get to be the only kids with disabilities who matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2234)|
| 0:37:21| Because my kid has a disability and he's got a black eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| Thank you. Next we have Kevin Hill. Kevin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| Please state your name, county, or residence and you have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| Kevin Hill, Knox County. So I want to agree with the support that's been given to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2255)|
| 0:37:43| and for the same reasons for encouraging hiring outside counsel. Skillsets are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| We've heard a lot about the expertise from the law department about ADA and education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2269)|
| 0:37:58| being combined. That's my red flag concern. We all understand the argument. There's two sides of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2278)|
| 0:38:05| We're disagreeing with their claim that they're the best. I mean, to put it very bluntly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| I've never known anyone who's the best at anything that works in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| Plain and simple. But that aside, the big concern I have is the argument is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2294)|
| 0:38:24| I keep hearing this statement about they need to be an ADA expert and education expert. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| the resolution that was passed said and or. An ADA specialist and or an education. So I'm concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2309)|
| 0:38:39| if the law department is the one that's controlling the vetting process for candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| that they're putting this double criteria on it that eliminates extremely effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2325)|
| 0:38:53| potential candidates that could be an extremely effective source of advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| I think the ADA requirement is an obvious no-brainer, but I don't know that this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| needs to necessarily, because if we do take the law department's argument for face value that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| they're the best or they have some of the best in the country, then we don't need to repeat those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| exact same skills and the value of an outside counsel would be creative thinking from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| different perspective. Now, you don't want a lawyer who does transactional work to be that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2362)|
| 0:39:29| outside perspective. You want relevance. An ADA expert would carry that relevance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| but to put a boundary that says they have to have worked in both fields as a criteria to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2374)|
| 0:39:41| be considered is deeply concerning to me and feels like it's an intentional hurdle put there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| to just obfuscate the process. So my advocacy is drop the education expert criteria entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2388)|
| 0:39:56| and focus on national quality ADA specialists. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2396)|
| 0:40:06| Thank you, and that concludes public forum on that item, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2406)|
| 0:40:17| Thank you, Madam Chair. I have some questions for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2417)|
| 0:40:27| David Boock, Knox County Law Director, 400 Main Street, Suite 612. Good evening, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2427)|
| 0:40:43| Thank you for being here, Mr. Boock. My first question would be if we are looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2443)|
| 0:40:50| an individual who is either an ADA expert or an education expert and we are looking nationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2450)|
| 0:40:56| for that person, how long, what kind of time frame would you expect that kind of search to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2456)|
| 0:41:06| We think we can get something very quickly for you, a name to submit to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| They're very limited. I mean, this whole case is ADA. The judge has expanded the ADA in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2471)|
| 0:41:19| education realm farther, farther than it has ever been done before. This is the first case of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2479)|
| 0:41:27| kind in this country, and that's what the fight is on. Can you use the ADA to stop gum chewing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2487)|
| 0:41:36| to make 60,000 students wear masks? As I have said to county commission and this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| I do not believe in it. I am dead set against what the judge has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| I am dead set against mandatory masks. We have taken that position for two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| in front of commission, in front of this body, and that's what we'll continue to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| Thank you. So, when you say that it would be fairly quick, we would not be able to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| a person before next month, is my assumption? Unless you called a special call meeting, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2524)|
| 0:42:11| could do that. Do you feel like there would be any advantage to having additional counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2531)|
| 0:42:19| on top of all of the multitude of attorneys you already have in your office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| No, I don't, because what happens in law when you're arguing is you look at all the cases. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| have looked at every education case in every federal district and circuit in this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2549)|
| 0:42:37| and we cited those to the court. We're now in front of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| raising all of those issues, constitutional, educational, and ADA. We also now, as you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2562)|
| 0:42:49| know, we're under an order to mediate, and there's been a joint motion put down by both the plaintiffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2569)|
| 0:42:57| and us to unmask, immediately unmask, these children while we go through this federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2577)|
| 0:43:04| mediation that the court has ordered that we do within a 60-day period. So, I don't think it adds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| anything other than takes money out of the school budget that could be used for playgrounds or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| students. And this resolution came to us prior to that mediation, is that correct? That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2596)|
| 0:43:22| Right. So, this proposed resolution had no knowledge of the mediation? That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2602)|
| 0:43:32| That mediation just came down Monday. Yeah, we got that mediation order Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2612)|
| 0:43:41| Assuming worst-case scenario that we did hire an additional counsel and that that additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2621)|
| 0:43:49| person were with us for some time, what could be the potential cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| Oh, my gosh. It would be- I'm thinking more than a couple of playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2635)|
| 0:44:02| You know, you're looking right now at attorneys in this state would be running a minimum of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2642)|
| 0:44:11| probably $500 an hour, and then there's travel time and putting up in a motel to meet with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2651)|
| 0:44:19| and or you. But, and believe me, they know how to keep track of hours. So, it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2659)|
| 0:44:26| very substantial. I can't give you a number. And that would all come out of school budget, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| That's correct. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| Thank you, Madam Chair. Director Book, I have a few more questions. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2684)|
| 0:44:55| So, given the- we just came out of executive session not too long ago. Given where the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| is in terms of process, purely process, is there anything that would change, let's say, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| instance, in what's before the Sixth Circuit District of Appeals at this point with outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| counsel helping advise? Or is what's already been submitted- does that question make sense? Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2713)|
| 0:45:20| there anything that we could add at this point given where the case is until the judge makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| his next move? In my opinion, no. I think we've raised every issue on the Sixth Circuit. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| locked in on the briefs that we filed in the Sixth Circuit. And the judge in- Judge Greer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2730)|
| 0:45:38| Green- excuse me- in Greenville has put a stay on filing anything else. So, we couldn't file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| anything else in the present case, either in the Sixth Circuit or in his court, because he's put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2744)|
| 0:45:50| a stay down pending this arbitration. So, I just want to make sure I'm clear in understanding this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| and the public is. You're saying at this point, until the mediation commences and we run through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2755)|
| 0:46:02| that, there's nothing else that we can currently submit to the courts in this case. Is that what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| you're saying? That's correct. And even then, if the judge were to lift the stay, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| pending, which he's not going to rule on, our separate motion to lift the stay based on the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2772)|
| 0:46:19| Because you've got to remember, if you get this case down to- there was two things that he had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| that he ruled on. That we had kids, the doctor said that they were more susceptible because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| their immune system or whatever. And the other one was that the CDC said match. Those are the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| things that he relied on. Now, the CDC is gone, but he's put down a stay. So, we will not be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2795)|
| 0:46:43| to argue that in front of him as long as this arbitration or mediation is going on. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| And then my second question is, at this point, I think this is correct, at this point, the plaintiffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| in this current case, it has asked and will ask for us to pay their attorney's fees, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| Absolutely. That's covered under the statute. And I think I'm right in this too. My understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| is also in the new case from Unmask Our Kids, there's an expectation that we would pay those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| attorney fees. Is that correct? They have asked for attorney's fees in that case also. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2830)|
| 0:47:17| And I just want to make sure I'm understanding this correctly. The school board does not pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| the law department for cases, for attorney's time, correct? Correct. Right. So, at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2840)|
| 0:47:28| we're looking at possibly paying the current plaintiff's fees, the new case attorney's fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| and then if we take this action, the fees of an outside attorney, possibly. Correct. And at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2854)|
| 0:47:41| point, the plaintiff's fees in the current case is already up to around $250,000, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| I would say they might be more. We won't really know until we get into arbitration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| I think that was the last number I heard, but that was a few weeks ago. That was a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| Yeah, it was a few weeks ago. Yeah. And obviously, the other case has just gotten started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| but I'm sure they're already generating fees. They have. But interesting in the Unmask case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| it's in front of the same judge. They're asking that judge to do what we've already asked him to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| do, and that's do away with this ADA extension, putting the masks on. Is the other case in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2889)|
| 0:48:18| of that same judge by happenstance, or is that just the what would happen because they're joining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| the cases? What happened was what the court does is the first thing that when a case comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2903)|
| 0:48:30| they look to see if there is a related case. If there's a related case, then the judge that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| the first case has the option to say, put that one on my docket. And that's what he did, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| it is clearly a related case. So he asked for this case to be, the other case to be put on his docket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2922)|
| 0:48:48| because of the relationship with the original case. Well, it was determined by him to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| So once it was, it just automatically, yeah, I don't know. Sure. I got you. Yeah, that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| effect. Yes, correct. Okay. Thank you. Ms. Bam. Sorry. I guess I just want to clarify too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2939)|
| 0:49:07| when we're talking about legal counsel coming up, we are going to be having to mediate. So we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| need legal expertise on that. And then also my understanding is we are going to be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| oral arguments in front of the appeals court too. And I'm assuming there's preparation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| things to be done for that. Is that correct? The main thing, they allow you, you go up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2962)|
| 0:49:29| Cincinnati and they allow you 15 minutes for oral argument, 15 minutes. They go by the briefs that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2969)|
| 0:49:36| we've already filed, which both sides have filed. That's what happens. But the oral argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| and I've been up there many a time in the oral arguments, really, they might ask you a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| of hard questions that they have that very seldom is there a, you don't get to go up like you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| arguing in front of a jury and give your whole case. They've already got it on the briefs. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| the oral argument is only 15 minutes and that's it. I guess we're hoping that 15 minutes is pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=2999)|
| 0:50:06| impactful though. So simultaneously we do have two things going on dealing with this case that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3006)|
| 0:50:14| we're needing legal expertise on. I just wanted to clarify that. It's not just the mediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3014)|
| 0:50:19| it's kind of both things at the same time. Right, the mediation in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| the appeal is going on. That's correct. There's two tracks and we've got, we just got word from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3023)|
| 0:50:30| the Sixth Circuit that our arguments will be on May 4th, but we don't know our panel yet until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3030)|
| 0:50:37| two weeks before they will tell us our panel. And that becomes interesting too because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| different panels may have different, you've got liberals and you've got conservatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3043)|
| 0:50:49| and so we don't know what kind of panel we're going to have or what they might have ruled on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| in similar kind of cases until two weeks before. Ms. Satterfield. Thank you Madam Chair. So knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3053)|
| 0:51:02| that we're unsure of the cost, this is for you Mr. McPherson, do, where will, if this does pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| how, what does the finance look like from our budget and where does it come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3068)|
| 0:51:17| I guess I would answer that is it would kind of depend on how much we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| which we don't know. I can tell you that we do have very healthy reserves, so my, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3081)|
| 0:51:29| are tracking very positively with surplus revenue collections, so I think again we don't have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3089)|
| 0:51:37| idea what the cost would be. I think my initial response or initial recommendation would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3097)|
| 0:51:43| that that would be funded from excess revenue collections from this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3103)|
| 0:51:52| Okay, so any other discussion? Mr. Watson. Thank you Madam Chair. Just a clarifying point Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3112)|
| 0:51:59| McPherson, is that also where, so if and when we pay the current attorneys for the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3119)|
| 0:52:07| case in the plaintiffs, is that also where those funds would come through? Yes sir, that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| my recommendation. Okay, thank you. Okay, so we have a motion by Ms. Babb, a second by Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3130)|
| 0:52:21| Any more discussion? Ms. Coatney, do we want to do a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3141)|
| 0:52:28| Ms. Satterfield. No. Ms. Owen. No. Mr. Watson. No. Ms. Babb. Yes. Ms. Horn. Yes. Ms. Henderson. Yes. Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3148)|
| 0:52:41| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| Ms. Christie. That's four yes votes, three no votes, and two pass votes. Ms. Bounds, did you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3164)|
| 0:52:50| want to change your pass vote? This is such a difficult decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3170)|
| 0:53:01| I'll change it to yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| Mr. McMillan. That's five yes votes, three no votes, and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3185)|
| 0:53:13| So motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3195)|
| 0:53:23| Item 12E, approve resolution reaffirming support for parents' choice for masking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3203)|
| 0:53:30| And we do have public forum on that, Madam Chair. Okay. Helena Rogge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| Ray Go. Oh no, I'm butchering, I'm sorry. Two minutes and 15 seconds on the clock you have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| I've gotten used to answering to whatever. Please, what is it? No, I want to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| What's your name? Helena. Helena. Ray Go. Ray Go. Two minutes, 15 seconds. I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3225)|
| 0:53:52| On the topic of getting our kids back to normal, schools across the board are extremely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3232)|
| 0:53:58| No offense, but at the super board attendance public forum, we had adults in the schools without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3238)|
| 0:54:04| masks on. And that really pissed me off because every day my daughter comes home with a headache,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| her stomach hurts, she can't hear her teacher, her teachers are yelling at her, she can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| have her parents come eat lunch with her like we used to do at least weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| She hasn't been on a field trip in years. It's time to remind the schools that we're moving on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3257)|
| 0:54:24| and that we're going to let our kids be kids. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3264)|
| 0:54:31| And that concludes public forum on that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| Okay, so do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| It's a motion by Ms. Henderson, a second by Ms. Horn. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3279)|
| 0:54:47| Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Henderson, I appreciate what you're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3287)|
| 0:54:54| in this resolution. I don't completely understand the need for the resolution. I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3294)|
| 0:55:04| we spend every, I mean, every other week, it seems like an executive session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3304)|
| 0:55:10| Director Book has been forced twice in the last two days. The board just approved hiring an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3310)|
| 0:55:17| additional attorney to help support. I think the law department knows. And you even state in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3317)|
| 0:55:23| resolution, this board has voted multiple times to allow parents the right. And I don't, I'm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3323)|
| 0:55:34| it feels like this is trying to send a message to a certain group of people. And I'm not sure if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3334)|
| 0:55:42| the board is the place to do that. I mean, the next resolution is a different matter to me, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3342)|
| 0:55:50| I don't know. I just don't see the point of it. And it's not that I am not supporting the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| in its efforts, because clearly the board has continued to make these statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3355)|
| 0:56:01| But I can't support it for that reason, because I honestly cannot find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| a purpose in stating it when the law department clearly knows the position of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3365)|
| 0:56:11| So, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3371)|
| 0:56:23| We have a motion by Ms. Henderson and a second by Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3383)|
| 0:56:30| Ms. Satterfield? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| Ms. Owen? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| Mr. Watson? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| Ms. Babb? Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| Ms. Henderson? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| Ms. Bounds? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| Mr. McMillan? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| Ms. Christie? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| That's four yes votes, three no votes, and two pass votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| Mr. Watson, did you want to change your pass vote? Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3412)|
| 0:57:01| So, motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| Ms. Coving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| Ms. Coving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| Item 12F, approved resolution requiring that all school activities return to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| Madam Chair, we do have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| Helena Rago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| State your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| You have a minute and 35 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| Helena Rago, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| I screwed up what I was talking about last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| That's what I get for not having notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| But one other point of returning to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| My daughter came home today and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| Jim, the PE teacher, asked me to pull up my mask while we were playing basketball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| while her mask was down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| She said, but we're six feet apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| I thought that was okay now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| This is why we need to remind the schools, just as a blanket statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| that we're returning to normal and maybe stop with the hypocrisy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| That concludes public forum, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| So, do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| So, a motion by Ms. Henderson, a second by Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| I just wanted to ask Ms. Thompson to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| Did you say, Ms. Thompson, that as of March 1st, was that the date that you gave us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| Is she here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| Oh, I thought she was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| Can you tell us what date that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| Is that the date that you gave us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| Is she here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| Oh, I thought she was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| Can you answer for me then, Dr. Eiswick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| I can, Ms. Bounds, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| And Ms. Thompson's actually traveling to a conference this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| So, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| We had a discussion sometime in early spring about when that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| so we could give principals some lead time on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| And so, both Mr. Trent and Ms. Thompson talked to principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| probably sometime in early February, that March 1st would be the date that that would start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| So, that was communicated to the principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3535)|
| 0:58:55| So, we've had it communicated to the principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| but we're not sure yet how that looks on the other side of March 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| I mean, we heard somebody say today, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| and there's a difference between pulling your mask up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| but I just haven't seen a real difference since March 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3551)|
| 0:59:17| From my feedback of what I'm hearing in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| So, I think this is a necessary resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3560)|
| 0:59:28| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| Mr. McMillan, is your mic, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3572)|
| 0:59:41| I'm not over there to turn it off for you is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3585)|
| 0:59:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| I'm supporting this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| but I also just want to lift up that just the wording in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| the past three school years have taken too many of these events away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| I know we know this, but I think we've been in a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| So, there's things that you have to modify when you're in a global pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| And so, I can see why things have been taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| But as we move forward, I do agree that for us to get back to those activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3609)|
| 1:00:16| but I do like the caveat of to the greatest extent possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| because some of our schools are still struggling with staffing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| Some of our schools just don't have the capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| And so, I want to make sure that we're not putting unnecessary pressure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| like you all discussed last week, on schools who just cannot do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| But if it is, yes, just schools who cannot do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| And so, I would like the administration to be considerate of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| but I will support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| Ms. Babin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| Well, and I'd kind of like to reiterate with that, that I think that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| and I'm in support of this too, I will not pass on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| I will vote in support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| But also, like in during the pandemic, we've had different principles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| changes and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| And with that, they change things at schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| they change activities, they change our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| So, supporting this does not mean everything that's going to happen this spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| is exactly what happened at a school pre-pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| because schools have changed, administration has changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| and their priorities might have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| So, I think, I don't want this to become a mass tattletaling of, you know, my school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| Like, let's work through this if you feel like there's a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| try to talk to the proper people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| I think what we're wanting is to, I think the intent of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| is to try to get our parents participating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| trying to get our kids to have normal activities, and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| But I just hope that this doesn't cause more problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| than what I think the objective is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| I'm pretty sure I said this last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| but I wanted to reiterate that I believe this is an administrative task,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| and that we are really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| we're sort of stepping on toes of the administration with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| They've had less than 10 days to make sure all principals have gotten that word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| and that that has been passed on to teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| and for things to actually change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| And when we're talking about things like field trips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| and redoing visitation for lunch, and all of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3734)|
| 1:02:20| I think having less than 10 days from the point of communication from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| all the way to the classroom level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| it's a little unreasonable to expect that to have already happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| And I feel like this is something that we should allow administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| to at least attempt to do before we push that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| Next, Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| I see this a little bit differently than Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| I see this more as a position statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| I don't know that this is asking for any specific action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| other than making a statement to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| this is what the board would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| This is the movement we would like to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| I'll be supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| I also want to make a statement too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| that in the board supporting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| I don't think the intent of the board, if we choose to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| I don't think the intent of the board is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| cause any consternation, or shame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| or anything like that within our administrators and our school staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| The reality is this last three years has been hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| And not just hard on students, but hard on educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| hard on us as a board, hard on our leaders in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| And so I think if this passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| I don't think it's an indictment to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| hey, we really messed up these last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| You all didn't do this well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| I think it's more to say, hey, we're here for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| And we want to continue to see things move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| I mean, that's the way I'm reading it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| And that's the way I would support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| Because again, I don't think this is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| saying somebody's done something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| It's more about this is what we hope for for the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| and what we expect as a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| I just wanted to address some of the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| And I appreciate the comments that I heard tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| And yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| I didn't write it as a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| I wrote it as a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| So it is a statement of here's what we would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| You know, the past couple years have been hard for teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| students, parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| So it is just a statement of we just want to get back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| And that's why I also wrote it to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| you know, to the greatest extent possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| Because Ms. Satterfield, to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| as you heard last Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| if schools don't have the capacity or the staffing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| that's definitely a totally separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| And, you know, shouldn't be considered in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| So it is just a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| I know last year I came with a policy that was more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| as Mr. Watson put it, had more teeth in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| And so again, just a statement of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| because we have heard from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| and parents of some inconsistencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| So just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| Thank you for this discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| I tend to agree with Ms. Owen and Mr. Watson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3906)|
| 1:05:14| to a certain extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3914)|
| 1:05:15| Don't give me too much credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| Ah, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| But having said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3919)|
| 1:05:27| I don't think it really does anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| And I think it's unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| I think what would be, we would be better served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| if over the next few days the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3937)|
| 1:05:44| I don't care how they do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| whether they do it, you know, by email or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3945)|
| 1:05:52| that they clarify with each and every principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| in Knox County what the expectations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| And we have some uniformity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| We can't have one doing this, one doing something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| And I'm afraid that we might get off on something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| And that's why I really can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| If we could just take a vote around the table here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3982)|
| 1:06:28| uh, to return to normalcy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| It passed 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| Everybody would vote for it, I would think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| if we didn't have that order and all that other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| So sometimes you're better to just leave things alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| We've, we voted as a board to support the masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4005)|
| 1:06:53| and all, all that sort of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| And return to normalcy as, as much as possible sometime back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4015)|
| 1:07:02| But anyway, that's, that's where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| I'm, I think it, it's, it's absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4027)|
| 1:07:17| necessary for the administration, however they want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| But to communicate that with each and every principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4041)|
| 1:07:27| over the next few days and make sure that there's uniformity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4047)|
| 1:07:34| whether it's lower level, high school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| Mr. Chien.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| Um, so really to this, I would just say, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| I think most students, you know, this has been a long two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| And I definitely think that most students want things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| to return to normal as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| And as Ms. Henderson's resolution says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| to the greatest extent possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| Now, I don't understand, I don't fully understand intricacies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| of if the board votes on this, what occurs with administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| But I do think whichever the board believes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| is the most effective way of trying to get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| so that students can return to that sense of normality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| especially given the current global situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| and the situation around COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| that I think that would be good for the board to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| I was just going to say that leaving the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| the other night, I began to get texts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| from teachers in my district that fully support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| And I think having been a teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| they're the ones on the ground that see this up close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| And so I was really surprised to get immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| some of their affirmations that we needed this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| And I don't think it has to be either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| I think we can pass this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| and we can also direct the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| and elementary, and he can direct elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| and secondary supervisors to more strongly state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| and make sure there is compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| So I think it can be both, to Mr. McMillan's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| I don't think it has to be either or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| but I think there has to be oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| at the secondary and primarily the elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| I think that's where we see the greatest disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| I agree with Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| I think that if we weren't hearing of instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| that perpetuate the circumstances of the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| that this wouldn't be needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| But we do continue to hear issues in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| And so I think that, and I think Ms. Bounds is right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| it can be that the superintendent reiterates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| to principals what the expectation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| But I think that this is, as I said Monday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| this is a position statement to our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| and to the community on where we stand on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| I've heard loud and clear from my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| And so I think this is a reflection of what I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| And so for those reasons, I'll be supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| Ms. Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| If Ms. Anderson would consider, I could change to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4221)|
| 1:10:27| if the word insists were changed to asks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4227)|
| 1:10:34| I feel that that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4234)|
| 1:10:40| that would feel less punitive toward our principals for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| in the resolution, be it resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| the Knox County Board of Education asks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| to the greatest extent possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4247)|
| 1:11:05| I'm fine with that because I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| that word really changes much in there, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4272)|
| 1:11:12| So is that a friendly amendment to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| I don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4279)|
| 1:11:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| So any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4280)|
| 1:11:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4297)|
| 1:11:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| Do we need a roll call vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| Ask, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4305)|
| 1:11:45| Let's do one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4305)|

| 1:12:38| This is probably the most I've gotten in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| in the shortest amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| But I wanted to be here tonight in support of the board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| that are the first ones up on the docket for complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| We've heard discussion last week about how things came about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| which were misunderstood from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| And I want to remind the board that last week and today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| other members of government have been sitting out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| in the audience and invited up by the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| to speak to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| That's very much what I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| I don't know the ins and the outs and the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| but that's very much what I saw watching that city council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| That second city, or I'm sorry, county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| That second county commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| I was at personally and most of the board walked in at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4401)|
| 1:13:27| What would happen if they were called up to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| Is that an ethics violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| Is that a policy violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| So it's something that I would like you to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| and something that we feel very strongly about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| is supporting our board members fighting for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| Next, we have Angel Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| Angel Jones, state your name, county, or residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| and you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4428)|
| 1:13:55| My name is Angel Jones, Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| I have two children in our public school system that I speak for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4438)|
| 1:14:04| Ms. Jones, can you pull your mic down just a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4447)|
| 1:14:07| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| Can I get a little, since you couldn't hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| Do I need to start over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| Well, I have two children in our public school system that I speak for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| Nobody else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| They're not a part of the 60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| I'm a sitting board member for Atheist Society of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| and the Satanic Ministry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| My comments do not reflect on the views of these organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| I filed an ethics complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| though I suppose it speaks more to their integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| On February 16, 2022, against three school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| in regards to Knox County School Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| policy B-112.4-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| Unlike a post made by one of those named in the complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| also in Knox County, a self-proclaimed satanic children's minister| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| has filed an ethics complaint against three school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| for exercising their first amendment right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| But that's a whole other story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| My complaint isn't about their first amendment right to free speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| It is about their actions as three board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| who went to the county commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| and posed at the entire school board when they requested this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4518)|
| 1:15:23| This is a resolution of the commission in Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| directing and Knox County law director to hire expert outside counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| to represent the Knox County Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| and all litigation regarding mask mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| When asked...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4536)|
| 1:15:43| Hold on, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| The whole school board, or what if one person just asked us to do something, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4544)|
| 1:15:50| I think we're looking to, as a school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| to have the power to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4555)|
| 1:15:55| So that we have the authorization to have outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| So if this body were to approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| you would all still go back and vote on it within your governing body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| whether to take action on that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4567)|
| 1:16:07| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| So along with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| to which the school board had already stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| and it was stated by you during that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| In fact, at the last meeting on February 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| a motion was made to allow the department to continue the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| Now they have heard all the board's thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| to do everything they feel is possible as quickly as they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| that does not violate rules or jeopardize the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| That's the official act of the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| not the request of the two board members that are making here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| To which that violates number four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| to work harmoniously with other board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| without trying to either dominate the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| Five, to vote or act impartially on the good of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| Six, to accept the will of the majority vote in all cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| and give support in the resulting action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| Three, board members of education are trying to dominate the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| by posing as the school board at the County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| They are acting in their will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| and not impartially for the good of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| They didn't accept the Board of Education's vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| to continue to use the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| So they went to the County Commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| to get a different answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| Next, we have Christina Gehrman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| Please state your name and county of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| and you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| You said it right, it's Gehrman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| Christina Gehrman, Knox County, District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| So I wanna say first how grateful I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| for the mask mandate that's been in place this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| which allowed my child to safely attend school in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| But I would also like to observe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| that had this board followed its own stated policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| with regard to COVID protocols| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| at the start of the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| the beautiful children of my neighbors who spoke earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| might have been more lovingly, more flexibly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| more appropriately, more lovingly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| more flexibly, more appropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| and much less expensively accommodated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| A version of the following complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4679)|
| 1:18:00| was submitted to the Board's Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| by Samantha Howell-Singh, who could not be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| Since her complaint was dismissed by the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| along with many others, I will state it briefly now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| to make it a matter of public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| The Knox County Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| Code of Ethics Section B220 states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| that no public officer shall corruptly use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| or attempt to use his or her official position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| to secure a special privilege, benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| or exemption for himself, herself, or others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| In Samantha's words, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| when Betsy Henderson, Christy Christie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| and Susan Horn attended county commission meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| as school board members and sent a resolution forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| to the county commission to seek outside counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| after the board voted against that motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| they were in violation, end quote, of B220.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| As an illustration, consider the following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| from the February 14th commission meeting transcript.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| Larson J., why didn't the board vote unilaterally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| for us to do the action that is before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| Betsy Henderson, I did make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| at the last school board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| I did have a letter that did not make it around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| to all of the school board members that evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| and according to the county charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| the action is up to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| They don't need a vote from school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| So I said I was going to take this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| to county commission either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| J., are you all acting on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| of the whole school board or just one person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| Henderson, we're looking as a school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| to have the power to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| Now the concern is that it appears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| that board member Henderson is representing the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| when she takes an action that the school board itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| explicitly voted not to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4771)|
| 1:19:32| at the immediately prior meeting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4772)|
| 1:19:37| Thus, there is the appearance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| that board member Henderson is using her position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| to, quote, secure a special privilege or benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| for herself or others, the benefit namely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| of the commission's approval to spend school board funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| on a project or priority that is hers or her friend's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4788)|
| 1:19:51| and not, by majority vote again, that of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| Whenever there is the appearance of unethical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| or unprofessional conduct on the part of any members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| of the board, it must be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| Not to do so jeopardizes the whole board's reputation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| and the public's trust in the whole board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| It also denies the named individuals the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| they deserve to respond to allegations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| of unprofessional and unethical conduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| Therefore, I would like to suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| that you the board yourself refer these matters for review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| either to the Tennessee School Board Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| or to the Tennessee State Department of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| or to some other institution with the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| and integrity to consider the many concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| that have been raised on their merits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| and to advise the board how to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| Madam Chair, that concludes public forum on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| Yes, as I stated Monday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| I would be bringing a motion forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| and I would like to read this motion at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| A motion to dismiss pending complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| against all board members on the grounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| of the strained political status of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| and officials, particularly around masking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| and on the grounds that the board policies B-171| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| and B-220 need revision and specification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| on procedure and forms for filing complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4869)|
| 1:21:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| So we have a motion by Ms. Bounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| second by Ms. Spav.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| Yes, I will be supporting this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| I just want to state that we are in leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| and there is an expectation that we follow policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| policy of our own, especially if we have that expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| of our schools and our principals and administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| So while I do support the removal of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| mostly because the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| that we really can't do anything when it comes to ethics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| I think it's our responsibility as public leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| to follow board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| Before we go any further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| I believe that it would be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| for Mr. Dupler to define| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4926)|
| 1:22:14| what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| consists here of ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| Now, he was there and after he explained it to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4940)|
| 1:22:26| when I say us, the ethic committee of whom I'm the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4946)|
| 1:22:32| uh, we voted unanimously, the three of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| to send it on to the entire board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4957)|
| 1:22:43| Mr. Dupler, would you, would you comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| on what you told us at that meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4966)|
| 1:22:53| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| I was feeling a little neglected with Law Director Book here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| so I appreciate you getting me involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| I'm kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| But so as far as the ethics complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4981)|
| 1:23:08| you know, what was discussed at the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| was that, you know, these are complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4991)|
| 1:23:15| they were termed ethics complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| but to be an ethics complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| it has to comply with board policy B220,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| which talks about ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| And specifically what that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| I mean, there's a lot of language in that policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| don't get me wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| but if you boil it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| I mean, it talks about conflicts of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| and very specifically conflicts of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| with financial stakes or financial gain for board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5018)|
| 1:23:44| So when one looks at the complaints on their face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| and again, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| all this was discussed at the ethics committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| was that, you know, they really weren't ethics complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| but since they were complaints of some type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| that's why we looked at policy B171| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| under the board's policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| And really, is that a great fit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| No, but it's really the only other policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| that the board has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| with regard to complaints coming before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| So that's what was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| Mr. Dupla, I appreciate the clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| and you and I have discussed that many times as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| So I've thought a lot about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| and specifically the motion that Ms. Bounds brought forth too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| And it's been very conflicting for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| as someone who has had a complaint filed against them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| I'm conflicted regarding the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| I don't know how I can vote for a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| to dismiss complaints that were filed against myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| I mean, it would seem odd to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| It seems to me to do so would be grounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| to call further calling to question my integrity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| which is something I value deeply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| So I don't think I can, I'm not looking for claps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5103)|
| 1:25:09| It's something that I value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5109)|
| 1:25:10| and I don't think I can vote for it for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| That being said, I do believe that this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| and pockets of the community, as the motion states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| at large have been strained due to political and culture wars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| throughout this pandemic due to mass mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| and a whole list of other very tenuous issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| in our community over that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| Unless we as a board decide that to the degree possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| we're going to set aside politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| and work together on behalf of all of our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| not much is going to change in this moment or the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| I also agree with Ms. Babb's sentiments on Monday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| that we as individuals do not really have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| nor likely the inclination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| to hold one another accountable publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| We just don't have the process for such a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| I mean, which Ms. Babb's motion also speaks to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| we know that policy B-171 is not really designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| to hold the board accountable to itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| We are really ultimately accountable to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| That being said, I'm confident that the public does expect us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| to be able to work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| and have a level of decorum, professionalism, trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| and focus in our work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| on behalf of all of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| And the other side of the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| that I think would be troubling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| I think, for the public if it passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5187)|
| 1:26:28| is it says to dismiss all pending complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5188)|
| 1:26:32| So we're saying that we are accountable to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| The public is trying to hold us accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| and then we're possibly putting a motion forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| to dismiss their complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| And Ms. Bounds, all I'm saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| I think we're in a catch-22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5206)|
| 1:26:47| I don't think there's any easy way out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| We don't have a policy to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| We don't, you know, the five people on this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| have ethics complaints filed against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| So for any of us individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| to vote in favor of dismissing them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| it's a hot mess of a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| And I hate that we're in this as a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| Many of us who have traveled to TSBA events together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| we have board members at those who say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| from across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5235)|
| 1:27:15| we love watching your board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| And it's not a compliment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| It's like, man, that is messed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| some of the things that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| And that's not an indictment on any one board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| All I'm trying to do is call us to something better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| And I think as we move toward the end of hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| all the issues related to this pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| that we can rescind ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| because I think that's needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| for the benefit of our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| and for the public and our educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| Ms. Sullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| I agree with Mr. Watson's assertion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| that it would be problematic for me to vote in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5272)|
| 1:27:57| of dismissing complaints against myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| So I definitely will not be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| We have several ways that the community can come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5284)|
| 1:28:09| and ask to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| They can come to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| They can follow policy B-171,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| which has the last section is appeals to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| And it says that certain matters relating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| to the operation of the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| may be appealed to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| However, the board desires that all matters be settled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5305)|
| 1:28:28| at the lowest level of responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| And we'll not hear complaints or concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| which have not advanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| through the proper administrative procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| from the point of origin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| Well, we are our own lowest point in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5317)|
| 1:28:42| So there's really no one else that can hear this but us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5322)|
| 1:28:47| If all administrative channels have been exhausted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| and there is still a desire to appeal to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| the matter shall be referred in writing to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| and the board shall determine whether to hear the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| And that is where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| As a member of the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| it was my understanding that having determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| that these complaints did not fit neatly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| into the category of ethics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| that they fit more in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| It was my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| not that we were just throwing them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| And I think there are some board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| who feel that because they are not in the ethics category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5360)|
| 1:29:26| we shouldn't be hearing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| I believe our point from my viewpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| on the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| was not that they just be dismissed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| because they're not ethics complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| but that they be moved forward as policy complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5377)|
| 1:29:43| There's been some discussion about the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| that we don't have a clear way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| for people to make complaints to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| and that we need that before we have this kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| I don't think our failure to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| that should be an adequate reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| to not allow people to address this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| regarding their complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| We also, in addition to 171,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| we also have B170,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| which is specific to public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| And being specific to public hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| it says that any individual requesting a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| before the board must make such request in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| stating the purpose of the hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| the action desired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| Then there's some stuff about school assignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| All requests for hearings must be received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| by the board or director of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| within the time limit prescribed by law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| for that category of hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| And I don't see where it is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5438)|
| 1:30:42| but I believe somewhere in policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| we ask that hearings and appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| be sent to the director seven days prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| to the meeting where they would be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| We definitely received these well past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| We have plenty of time for consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| and following the ethics committee recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5459)|
| 1:31:04| all of the complainants were asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| whether they wanted to continue forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| So we have followed our policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| for bringing them here for a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| And that is, that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| we've seriously need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| The fact that we have followed the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| that we have regarding bringing them for a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| At what point do we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| well, we didn't have this other policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| so we're not going to follow these either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| I think that kind of consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| needed to be made before we got to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| and it couldn't have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| So here we are, we've told people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| they will come here for a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| and now we are saying, no, we're not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| The only way I could, well, I can't vote for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| but the only way I could feel support for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| would be if we created some kind of mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5521)|
| 1:32:07| for a committee to hear the complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| and to hear them publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| so that a recommendation could be made back to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| Well, I just want to take a minute to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| since some of these were against me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| and those of you that were on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| in February of 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| might remember a policy review meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| where I brought policy B-171 up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5552)|
| 1:32:37| and about following the will of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| I think Mr. Dupour, you were there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| and we discussed that and then COVID hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| and we kind of got off track a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| But, you know, and it was said then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| that, you know, each individual board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| still had their right to free speech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| and pretty much to say what they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| So we did have, this is a policy problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| and we probably should have addressed the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| back at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| But like I said, that was in February of 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| and I think we all know what happened shortly after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| and there was a lot more pressing issues going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| So first, I will say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| Secondly, I will say that most people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| when they file or complain about board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| they typically don't recruit a bunch of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| to file complaints against single board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| and they certainly don't typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| send out a press release when they send an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| to the board complaining about people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| But I think the biggest problem is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| it's a policy problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| and it needs to go back to policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| and there needs to be, we need to address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| we need to change policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| or maybe have a clear path forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| a procedure for complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| because we can't just have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| I mean, how many people have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| complaints filed against them now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| I mean, most of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| And we can't just hijack our board meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| every month, every time somebody gets mad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| or disagrees with a board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| I mean, we have to have a better policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| and we have to have a better path forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| Ms. Vann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| Yeah, I mean, I guess where I'm really confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| is I don't see what Ms. Owen wants us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| I mean, right now, out of the nine of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| five people have complaints against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| I personally wouldn't have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5678)|
| 1:34:39| at the county commission meeting speaking also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| if I hadn't been in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| So I'll just say I probably should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| an ethics complaint against myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| And also someone who did an ethics complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| then complained that board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| who gave money to someone's campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| who had an ethics complaint against them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| also had problems doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| So we've got five people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| that have got complaints against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| At least two of us have given money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| to people with complaints against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| I just don't even know where we're supposed to go with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| And so that's where I'm asking Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| I mean, I know we've brought it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5722)|
| 1:35:23| but what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| I mean, what do you want us to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| It sounds like you want us to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5730)|
| 1:35:31| but I can't figure out what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| We've come here and we've told the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| they will be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5737)|
| 1:35:38| And we've heard them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| We have not had it, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| We've heard them in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| We have heard them in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| That's not a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| They should have never had to address this in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| They should have had an appropriate-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| I want you to detail out for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| how you think this is supposed to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| I'm totally lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| You have to tell me about the letter that they sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| Tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| Well, I'll pull it all out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| We have a hearing procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5766)|
| 1:36:13| We have a hearing policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| We have told people that they will have time to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5775)|
| 1:36:19| And public forum is not the length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| It's three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5781)|
| 1:36:22| It's not the 10-minute length of a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| that they would have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| and address all of the issues that they have brought to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| We told people they would come here and have a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| I want us to keep our word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| I want us to act with integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| And then when we hear from these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| what do we as a board do then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| Because there's probably-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| We will have to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| We would have to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| I would assume that whatever complaint is up at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| that the people or persons who are named in that complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| would not be able to take any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| I would certainly recuse myself from mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5822)|
| 1:37:07| I don't think we can say what we would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| when we haven't heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| We haven't heard the complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| That's the whole point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| Without a hearing-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| We've read them, haven't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| I mean, we've all read them, haven't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| Have we seen everything that the people would bring to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| Are we getting everybody to have attorneys in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| Or what is your thought?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| I'm going to say it one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| I expect the people who brought complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| to have the opportunity to have the hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| that we told them they would have, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5860)|
| 1:37:47| I don't know who was next over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| Based on what you were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| Ms. Owen, you kept talking about the resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5875)|
| 1:38:03| I mean, the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| Not resolutions, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| The policies, policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5887)|
| 1:38:13| It would appear to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| and based on what Ms. Christie said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| that we should send them to policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5898)|
| 1:38:23| and let them have their say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| before the policy review people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5907)|
| 1:38:32| Now, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| it doesn't necessarily need to be a special committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| but that would be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| that you could discuss, policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| and then bring whatever comes out of policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5928)|
| 1:38:55| One person there could bring it before the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5935)|
| 1:39:00| to see how they wanted to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| They would get an opportunity to air their concerns there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5942)|
| 1:39:08| much better along the lines of what you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| If we vote, if we go around here and vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| we won't have enough to pass anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| That's just a simple fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| because there's only about three people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5963)|
| 1:39:28| that don't have a complaint filed against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5968)|
| 1:39:39| Three and possibly one more that should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5979)|
| 1:39:45| But those are my thoughts on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5985)|
| 1:39:50| I don't think we could actually do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| What would you think about that, Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| I think that would be an acceptable solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=5997)|
| 1:40:04| as long as all complainants have an opportunity to be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6004)|
| 1:40:09| and as long as they have adequate time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| to be able to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| My concern would be that policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| is normally in the middle of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| and would be much more difficult than at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6019)|
| 1:40:23| but I'm not sure whether that would be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| If it's that important to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| they'll find a way to show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| get off at lunchtime or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| you know, take a couple hours, come up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6034)|
| 1:40:40| Maybe not even that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| That would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6044)|
| 1:40:45| We may have a few dozen more by the end of the break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| We're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6048)|
| 1:40:48| Ms. Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| As Ms. Owen stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| we do have multiple avenues for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| to communicate with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| We have public forum monthly on any topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| We have public forum on issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| that are on our agenda for work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| So we have multiple opportunities for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| to come and give us their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| We are ultimately, as we discussed the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| we are ultimately accountable to our voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| and those are the people that we represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| and the people that I've heard from my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6082)|
| 1:41:26| have been supportive of me attending a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| and speaking when called upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| So that's, you know, I'm accountable to my voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6093)|
| 1:41:39| Secondly, I'm not sure that providing another stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| for people to complain against about our policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| or the decisions that we've made is going to be productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| I would like to see this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| not deal with complaints such as these on and on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6113)|
| 1:41:59| but deal with the things that will help kids in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| And this is a distraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| This distracts from what we need to be focusing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| And it's been a huge distraction over the past two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6131)|
| 1:42:15| whatever it's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| And I just think that it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| I believe that people need to be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| but I think we provide a forum for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| And these are not ethics violations as we've discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| I think that if we have a true ethics violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| then that's another story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| and that needs to be taken extremely seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| There may be some tweak to policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| that we need to discuss in policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| but I don't feel like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| I feel like that we've had people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| that came and spoke this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| and we provide a public forum for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6167)|
| 1:42:53| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6173)|
| 1:42:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6175)|
| 1:42:55| Just quickly, I know it was discussed Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| but I want to lift it up again today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| I think this situation has just exposed some gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| that we need to close within our policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| but also in the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| we talked about getting a forum on our website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| to have a more formal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| And so I look forward to seeing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| To be able to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| make sure that it's vetted completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| before it actually goes to the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| But I think that that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| like again, the situation exposed a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| And so I guess that's the silver lining in all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| I just want to say a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| I agree with Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| This was nothing more than an orchestrated attack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| on a couple of board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| We didn't go prepared to speak to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| We were asked at the meeting to answer questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| and asked to be there by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| And, you know, we need to focus these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| This has been a huge distraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| One staff member I spoke to last week alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| spent 40 hours dealing with this issue in these complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6243)|
| 1:44:08| 40 hours that were not spent on our children's education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6248)|
| 1:44:14| And that's unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| And I think just because you don't agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| with the board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| you can't have a hearing every time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| you just don't like what they have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| And I said it from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6263)|
| 1:44:24| I will continue to fight for children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| and I will continue to fight for their freedoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| This is nothing more than a political distraction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| when we're trying to make a difference for 60,000 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| I agree that this was political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| And that is where the problem was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6286)|
| 1:44:52| At the last meeting, Ms. Baird,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| the board member, Ms. Baird,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| was the one who said that we need to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6299)|
| 1:44:59| We need to do something about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| We need to do something about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| We need to do something about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| We need to do something about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| At the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| Ms. Bounds noted that she and Mr. McMillan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| are the longest serving board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| And I know that during their time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| they have seen this board do a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| But what I don't recall ever seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6319)|
| 1:45:23| in my time on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6323)|
| 1:45:24| or any of the decade before that I was watching the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| I don't recall a time when any board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| ever stepped into a public place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| and presented themselves as representing the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6335)|
| 1:45:43| To let this kind of thing just go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| sets a really concerning precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| Because this is not about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6351)|
| 1:45:55| this is not a question of free speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| It's a question of using our position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6359)|
| 1:46:04| to represent ourselves as coming from the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6364)|
| 1:46:10| So to just let it go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6370)|
| 1:46:15| makes me wonder if tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| if I can choose something from what we voted tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| and go find some other body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| and ask them if they could please undermine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6385)|
| 1:46:28| the authority of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| Because that's really what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| We're not talking about just disagreeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6392)|
| 1:46:36| We're not talking about just saying what we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| We're talking about very knowingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6399)|
| 1:46:43| and willfully stating that this is what the board wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6403)|
| 1:46:49| when we knew that the board had voted otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6409)|
| 1:46:55| And that's what I think this all comes down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6415)|
| 1:47:02| I have, I don't know of any other time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6422)|
| 1:47:10| I've seen something from a board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| that was used as if it came from the whole board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| But I don't recall a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| when any board member has done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| And if we don't take some kind of stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6440)|
| 1:47:25| to say that we are not going to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| our board members to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| then I don't know what's to stop all of us from doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6450)|
| 1:47:37| You know, at what point do we decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| that we are actually going to be accountable to ourselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6460)|
| 1:47:46| I think if we're going to talk about accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| we need to be accountable to ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| And that includes being very careful with words we use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| when we are talking to other bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6476)|
| 1:47:59| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6479)|
| 1:48:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| Prior to COVID, I attended most every commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6485)|
| 1:48:10| and commissioners came here to our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| And there was a time in Knox County politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| when there was a very strained relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| between the board and our funding body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6499)|
| 1:48:22| So when I was elected to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| I made it my decision to go to every commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| that I could and be there to listen and to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6508)|
| 1:48:33| And they in turn came to our board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| And that's why we always start our board meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| with recognizing officials in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| And I was always recognized as a school board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6522)|
| 1:48:47| when I was sitting in the back of the audience to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6527)|
| 1:48:52| I think what this comes down to, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| and respectfully, Ms. Owen, is that is your interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6535)|
| 1:49:01| and that is the way you see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| But therein is the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| There is no...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| There are others that do not feel like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| and they do not believe they did that in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6551)|
| 1:49:16| So while you're entitled to your opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| there are others that are entitled to their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| And with my motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| I would like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6566)|
| 1:49:37| I'll take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6577)|
| 1:49:46| Do you want to call for the question with a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| or without objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| Oh, with a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6592)|
| 1:49:55| At this...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| I'm calling the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| Do we have to vote to call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| Is that what you're clarifying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| If there's no other discussion, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6608)|
| 1:50:09| you can all go ahead and call for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| I mean, if somebody does want to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| then according to Robert's rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| you would have to vote on the call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| Well, if there's somebody, we can continue to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6618)|
| 1:50:22| I just thought we had all discussed it quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6622)|
| 1:50:35| There's no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| Well, I would object because I have one point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| and I will make it quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6640)|
| 1:50:41| This answers Ms. Babb's earlier question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| What would we know that we don't know now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| The Ethics Committee, when we first discussed meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6648)|
| 1:50:52| we expected to see the video of that commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| We did not see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| We next expected to see that tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| and I have not yet seen that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6661)|
| 1:51:04| That may make a difference in someone's perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6664)|
| 1:51:08| of what was actually said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| So whether it's opinion or whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| what was actually said, we have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| seen evidence to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6675)|
| 1:51:21| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| Yeah, I'd like to make a point as long as we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| doing call for the question, because I, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| sort of agree on different perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| And what I look at as there are definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6688)|
| 1:51:31| some different complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| But one of the main complaints is about our school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| members going to the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| One of the main complaints is about our school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| going before county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| And I saw them going to county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| to ask for the permission to us being able to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| on what we voted on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| We as a board, or at least I interpreted it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| and I think some other people did, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| we were not even granted the permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| And we kept being told we did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6717)|
| 1:51:58| have any authority through the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| to hire another lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| We kept being told that, and we kept being told that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6722)|
| 1:52:06| And so I see the board members going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6726)|
| 1:52:10| and they were not saying they had the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6733)|
| 1:52:14| Because our board tonight could have voted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| and it was a split vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| What they were asking is just for the ability for our board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| to bring that up for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| And I completely support them in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| I think they came as individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| If I had been at that board meeting, county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| meeting, and been brought up, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| have had the same plea to our county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6752)|
| 1:52:37| Once again, our David Boot does not have to even grant it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| I mean, it's up to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| We can only ask him for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6762)|
| 1:52:43| And that is all we were asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| or that's all these three were asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6766)|
| 1:52:48| So I just have a hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| I mean, I know you want to see the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| We've had some people who've said recordings of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| We've had transcripts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| We've had the ability to go back and watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| the YouTube of county commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| And I just think there's a different interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| I think you feel people have done one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| Patty kind of interprets it a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| I do, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| So I'm just kind of over this, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6794)|
| 1:53:21| So Mr. Duport did give some clarification there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6801)|
| 1:53:28| So with a call for the question, if she got a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| we could vote on calling for the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| just to throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6818)|
| 1:53:38| I just have a quick question for you, board member Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6818)|
| 1:53:42| Do you speak for Knox County Schools Board of Education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6822)|
| 1:53:46| I speak as Betsy Henderson, not for the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| the entire school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| So why didn't you say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6833)|
| 1:53:58| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6838)|
| 1:53:59| I just want to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| This goes way back in reference to what Ms. Bowne said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6842)|
| 1:54:08| We've both been around longer than anybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| has been on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| And I've been here a little bit longer than she has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6854)|
| 1:54:18| And having said that, when she said we've come a long way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6858)|
| 1:54:25| the first year that I was on the board at the retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6865)|
| 1:54:32| the person that was the chair, then chair of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6872)|
| 1:54:38| I raised a question about establishing a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6878)|
| 1:54:43| relationship with county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| And you know what the response was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6887)|
| 1:54:51| Who cares what they think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| We do what we want to, as long as we've got the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6894)|
| 1:55:03| And that person truly believed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6903)|
| 1:55:08| But the irony of it is we've gone from there to where we are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6908)|
| 1:55:17| through the ranks, recognizing people, knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| And probably that person knew who their county commissioner was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6921)|
| 1:55:27| I'm not sure that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| But anyway, I just thought that was an interesting thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6929)|
| 1:55:33| I'm sorry to bore you with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| Ms. Thorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6936)|
| 1:55:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| I'll be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6938)|
| 1:55:39| I just wanted to state that on that afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6939)|
| 1:55:43| I called Commissioner Schoonmaker because I had heard when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| that there was going to be some sort of mass conversation at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6947)|
| 1:55:51| So I felt like if the commission is talking about a topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6951)|
| 1:55:54| that we've talked so much about, that it was my duty as a school board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6954)|
| 1:55:58| to go and listen and see what they were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6958)|
| 1:56:01| Had no intention of talking and speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6961)|
| 1:56:05| But as a board member who has represented the district that I'm in regarding this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6965)|
| 1:56:11| that's, you know, just as Ms. Babb said, I was an interested school board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6971)|
| 1:56:18| So that's why I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| So I think it's wise for us to, the point made earlier about past commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6979)|
| 1:56:26| I think it's wise for us to have a good relationship with our commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=6986)|
| 1:57:01| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| With no other lights on, if you withdraw your call for the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| we can go back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| Okay. If I call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7029)|
| 1:57:12| Oh, withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7032)|
| 1:57:13| Yes, I will withdraw that seeing no lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| So we're back to the original motion by Ms. Bounds and second by Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7036)|
| 1:57:22| So the motion is to dismiss all pending complaints against all board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7042)|
| 1:57:27| on the grounds of the strained political status of the community and officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7047)|
| 1:57:31| particularly around masking and on the grounds that board policies B-171| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7051)|
| 1:57:37| and B-220 need revision and specification on procedure and forms for filing complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7057)|
| 1:57:45| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7068)|
| 1:57:49| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7071)|
| 1:57:51| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7078)|
| 1:57:59| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7079)|
| 1:58:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7080)|
| 1:58:00| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7080)|
| 1:58:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| That's six yes votes, one no vote, and two pass votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| Mr. Watson or Ms. Babb, did you want to change your vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7087)|
| 1:58:14| So motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7094)|
| 1:58:20| And then we had an item added 12-H discussion possible action by which the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7100)|
| 1:58:27| will enter into mediation in the active mask case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7107)|
| 1:58:32| So that was yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7112)|
| 1:58:57| Yeah, will you read it one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7137)|
| 1:58:58| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7138)|
| 1:58:58| Motion for discussion and possible action regarding means in which the Knox County Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| of Education will expeditiously enter into mediation with the plaintiffs in the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7142)|
| 1:59:07| active mask case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| So a motion by Mr. Watson, a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| And Mr. Duport, did you want to speak to that just kind of maybe to let the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7154)|
| 1:59:23| go on record maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| Sure, I'll be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| So as we talked about Monday night, Judge Greer with the Federal District Court has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7169)|
| 1:59:37| ordered this board to mediate as well as the plaintiffs in the original mask case, as Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7177)|
| 1:59:43| Watson has stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| So what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| Well, so the board, being a public body, really has two good choices here as to how to mediate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7187)|
| 1:59:57| The first one would be something similar to what this board's already decided as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7197)|
| 2:00:04| negotiation, and that would be to designate a representative or representatives to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7204)|
| 2:00:12| into mediation and have what would be a traditional type of mediation where the plaintiffs and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7212)|
| 2:00:20| their attorneys are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| We would be there representing the board as well as the designees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7222)|
| 2:00:26| And then we would mediate as is commonly seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7226)|
| 2:00:31| The catch there would be it would be a non-binding mediation until the representatives come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7231)|
| 2:00:40| back to the board and present the offer or the proposed agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7240)|
| 2:00:47| And then this entire board would have to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7247)|
| 2:00:50| Presumably that would take the form of a special called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| But that is what would have to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| And then the other catch, if you will, would be that there could be some type of misgivings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7257)|
| 2:01:04| between the time of the mediation and the time that the board takes it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7264)|
| 2:01:09| So that's option one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| Option two would be a mediation that would probably be fairly unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7271)|
| 2:01:19| It would be a combination of an open meeting of the board, because as I state regularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7279)|
| 2:01:27| before this board, this board cannot deliberate in secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7287)|
| 2:01:32| I mean, it would have to deliberate in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| So we would have, we would alternate between an executive session and a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7295)|
| 2:01:42| An executive session, I and my colleagues could speak to the board and talk about legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7302)|
| 2:01:49| issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7309)|
| 2:01:50| And then once the board comes back into public session, I mean, the board would then deliberate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7310)|
| 2:01:57| whatever the offer or demand is that's on the table at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7317)|
| 2:02:02| It would all occur in a sequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7322)|
| 2:02:05| And something like that would take, you know, at least probably half a day, if not a full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7325)|
| 2:02:11| day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| So that's kind of your basics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7332)|
| 2:02:16| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7336)|
| 2:02:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| Thank you, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7338)|
| 2:02:21| As we've heard, it's a very unique situation, and I think the explanation helps, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7341)|
| 2:02:25| anybody who has any former experience with mediation probably would not have experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7345)|
| 2:02:29| with this type of mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| So just to kick it off the discussion, I would like to recommend the board consider doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7351)|
| 2:02:36| it in public session, mainly because I think it will be more expeditious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7356)|
| 2:02:40| I think it's difficult to ask one person on a non-member board with very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7360)|
| 2:02:46| perspectives, views, all those types of things to go in and mediate on behalf of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7366)|
| 2:02:50| and then have to come to the board in a separate meeting and likely go back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| I think, you know, to be able to, although it might take a day to sit there and knock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7375)|
| 2:03:00| it out, would be a benefit to our system, to our students, to our educators, and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7380)|
| 2:03:07| the public at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| So that would be my recommendation to kick off the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| And I'll just say, Mr. Watson, I had that discussion with Mr. Dupler yesterday about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7391)|
| 2:03:16| that, and being someone who's tried to negotiate, it does put you in a difficult position because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7396)|
| 2:03:25| you know, we all have different opinions, and it's hard to predict what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7405)|
| 2:03:31| someone may or may not agree to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| So I would prefer that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7413)|
| 2:03:38| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7418)|
| 2:03:40| This is a question for Mr. Dupler, and I probably know the answer, but as far as an open meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7420)|
| 2:03:45| goes, are there ways to limit how open it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7425)|
| 2:03:51| And I mean, I'm truly being like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7431)|
| 2:03:52| I mean, like, could it be that we just let press come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| I mean, I mean, I think everybody has got to understand that this is a very, not a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7435)|
| 2:04:00| position we're being put in as far as negotiating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| So I just didn't know, I mean, we talked about maybe possibly that not televising it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7444)|
| 2:04:10| Is that a possibility for us not to televise it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| And what other limitations could there be put on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7453)|
| 2:04:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7456)|
| 2:04:17| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| So an open meeting would have to be open to the public, so you wouldn't be able to limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7459)|
| 2:04:23| it to just certain segments of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7463)|
| 2:04:25| It would have to be truly the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| You know, the videotaping of meetings has become fairly routine in later years, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7467)|
| 2:04:37| certainly what the, and I'd be happy to double check this, but I mean, last time I did check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7477)|
| 2:04:44| what it requires is that minutes be recorded so that they can be used later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7484)|
| 2:04:50| But I mean, so there could be that possibility that it wouldn't have to be videotaped, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7490)|
| 2:04:55| it's certainly still open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| And it's probably not even videotaped as much as live streamed is probably my bigger issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7496)|
| 2:05:02| Like somebody seeing it later, I don't really have a problem with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| I think it's just, I mean, there's obviously being open, we lose all secrecy whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7504)|
| 2:05:10| but I do think there's a big difference in someone actually watching us having a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7510)|
| 2:05:15| live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7515)|
| 2:05:18| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7518)|
| 2:05:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7520)|
| 2:05:21| And to your point, Ms. Babb, I think, you know, the other thing that you have to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7521)|
| 2:05:26| about whenever you're thinking about mediation and negotiation is in some ways to do it effectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| you need to be able to be private to a degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7531)|
| 2:05:35| You know, and that's the nature of any negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| I'm not going to talk about buying, what I'm going to do to buy my car in front of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| salesman, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7539)|
| 2:05:40| Like that would put me at a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7540)|
| 2:05:43| So I just want the public to know that if we decide to not live stream it, it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7543)|
| 2:05:49| to prevent the public from experiencing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| It's because the reality is the plaintiffs could be in their mediation room and could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7552)|
| 2:05:57| be watching what we're discussing, which would make a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7557)|
| 2:06:01| And so, again, it's not about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| It's purely to uphold the integrity of a mediation, which is you have to have some ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7564)|
| 2:06:11| to be able to speak and negotiate without the other party listening in at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7571)|
| 2:06:20| Ms. Beck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| I mean, along those lines, I mean, I think the whole thing is we're trying to keep our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7581)|
| 2:06:26| negotiating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7586)|
| 2:06:26| We're not trying to keep secret from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| We're trying to keep negotiating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7588)|
| 2:06:29| I mean, I'm even wondering, is there something where if you want to come in, you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7589)|
| 2:06:33| leave your phone, purse outside in a secure place or something like that so that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7593)|
| 2:06:38| in there are not communicating with the plaintiffs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| I mean, I just, we're trying to have the best integrity of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7601)|
| 2:06:44| And I'm just trying to see if there are any possibilities with the circumstances that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7604)|
| 2:06:48| we're being required to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| If the, well, I mean, you know, if the board's going to vote on it tonight, I mean, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7612)|
| 2:06:57| certainly check and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| I can't guarantee anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| But like I say, off the top of my head, I mean, it certainly would require minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7621)|
| 2:07:04| would require open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| I don't know that you could check devices at the door or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7626)|
| 2:07:09| I mean, I do think, again, that videotaping and certainly live streaming could certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7629)|
| 2:07:16| be controlled to a degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7636)|
| 2:07:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7641)|
| 2:07:21| So to your point, we could in this body tonight make a motion to check in devices and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7641)|
| 2:07:29| you could check retroactively to see if that's even possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| And if it's not, then it would just be moot, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| You don't need to check in advance is what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7655)|
| 2:07:38| Because if you do, I would like for you to start checking in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7658)|
| 2:07:46| That'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7666)|
| 2:07:47| Let's keep talking, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| Keep talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7668)|
| 2:07:49| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| We will also need to spend today on selecting a date, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7671)|
| 2:07:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7677)|
| 2:07:58| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| Don't get ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7683)|
| 2:08:04| Don't get ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7684)|
| 2:08:11| Well, and I do think people need to understand that, that some of us do have scheduling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7691)|
| 2:08:16| conflicts, that it might be something, if we all decide to do this, that all nine of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7696)|
| 2:08:19| us can't be there just because of different circumstances coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7699)|
| 2:08:23| So I do think we're going to have to trust when it happens that the majority of us can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7703)|
| 2:08:27| come and have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7707)|
| 2:08:32| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7712)|
| 2:08:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7713)|
| 2:08:34| Mr. Dupler, I've thought about this kind of after, just in thinking about this just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7714)|
| 2:08:40| before this meeting, would it be helpful to, okay, even if we, if we have a, if we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7720)|
| 2:08:50| kind of mediating in real time, but prior to that, would it be helpful or would it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7730)|
| 2:08:57| appropriate for each board member to give you the, you know, kind of a listing of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7737)|
| 2:09:06| thoughts on the issue so that you know that ahead of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7746)|
| 2:09:14| Like we would, you know, does that make sense, my question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7754)|
| 2:09:17| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7757)|
| 2:09:17| Thank you, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| So, and I was just looking, I mean, again, the basic requirements of the Open Meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7759)|
| 2:09:24| Act is that it's a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7764)|
| 2:09:26| So again, you know, open to the public and that it be properly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7766)|
| 2:09:32| And then again, they obviously have to have minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7772)|
| 2:09:34| So, so again, I mean, I think there is a possibility of doing some type of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7774)|
| 2:09:40| video restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7780)|
| 2:09:43| Now, as far as what you're saying, Ms. Horne, certainly, I mean, you know, individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7783)|
| 2:09:48| board members are free to communicate with our office at any time as long as you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7788)|
| 2:09:55| not conversing with other board members and then making it a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7795)|
| 2:10:01| So, so individually, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| So, since we, well, we just have discussion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7804)|
| 2:10:11| So, if we want to take like a 10-minute break while he researches this and then we can come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7811)|
| 2:10:16| back and do that because we don't have a motion on the floor about it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7816)|
| 2:10:24| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7824)|
| 2:10:25| It's for the discussion and possible action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| It's discussion, but nobody's made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7826)|
| 2:10:27| Well, discussion and possible action, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| Right, but nobody's made a motion for action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7829)|
| 2:10:33| So, we can take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| I'm trying to knock one out real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| Well, he's researching that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| So, we can take a 10-minute break and you can, you can work on that and he can work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| on that and then we'll come back in two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7843)|
| 2:10:52| And we're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7852)|
| 2:10:56| So, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7856)|
| 2:11:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7860)|
| 2:11:01| I'd like to put a motion before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7861)|
| 2:11:04| I make a motion for the Knox County Board of Education to enter into mediation with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7864)|
| 2:11:09| the plaintiffs in the original mass case as a full body with a minimum of five members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7869)|
| 2:11:14| present and a publicly noticed open meeting to be scheduled once a mediator has been assigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7874)|
| 2:11:20| The mediation will occur under rules dictating federal mediation and not be live streamed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7880)|
| 2:11:25| So, we have a motion by Mr. Watson and a second by Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7885)|
| 2:11:29| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7889)|
| 2:11:30| So, is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7890)|
| 2:11:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7896)|
| 2:11:39| Do you want to do a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7899)|
| 2:11:40| Do we need a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7900)|
| 2:11:41| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7901)|
| 2:11:44| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7904)|
| 2:11:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7905)|
| 2:11:46| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7906)|
| 2:11:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7907)|
| 2:11:47| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7907)|

| 2:11:50| Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7910)|
| 2:11:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7910)|

| 2:11:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7911)|

| 2:11:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7913)|

| 2:11:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7918)|
| 2:11:58| That's nine yes votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7920)|
| 2:12:01| That's our last agenda, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| We have public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| All right, Madam Chair, we do have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7927)|
| 2:12:11| First person, we have Andrea Pfister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7931)|
| 2:12:14| I'm sorry, I butchered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7934)|
| 2:12:17| No, she's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7937)|
| 2:12:18| Not here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7938)|
| 2:12:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7939)|
| 2:12:19| Next, we have Keith Ritz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7939)|
| 2:12:25| Please state your name, county, and residence, and you will have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7945)|
| 2:12:29| Hi, Keith Ritz, 506 Milton Drive, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7949)|
| 2:12:34| I hate to be the one to tell you this, but you guys have turned this board into a sideshow circus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7954)|
| 2:12:41| We have been here for two and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| We spent 25 minutes on things that actually affected students, teachers, and parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7964)|
| 2:12:49| The rest of it was political nonsense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7969)|
| 2:12:52| I have friends out of state calling me and asking me, is this real?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7972)|
| 2:12:58| And I want to tell them, no, they don't represent us, but you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220309?start=7978)|
