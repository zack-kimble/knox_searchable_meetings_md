| 0:00:42| Please stand and face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=42)|

| 0:00:49| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=49)|
| 0:00:54| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=54)|

| 0:01:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=82)|
| 0:01:23| We are missing one councilman, and he may be here a little later, but we will proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=83)|
| 0:01:26| This is an opportunity for us this evening to learn a bit more about the Proposed Science Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=86)|
| 0:01:32| We're delighted that Mr. Clayton is here with us, and we're looking forward to hearing about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=92)|
| 0:01:37| At this point, I'm going to turn it over to David Brace and Bill Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=97)|
| 0:01:43| There they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| I'll go ahead and start just with an introduction and turn it over to David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=105)|
| 0:01:49| We're here today to talk about the Proposed Clayton Science Museum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| to give you some background and, in essence, how we got here, the steps ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| and, most importantly, for you to see the incredible vision that the Claytons have for this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=117)|
| 0:02:03| Just personally, I've been involved in this for a number of years because there have been a few iterations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| and studies that the Clayton family has done about the potential for a science museum in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=129)|
| 0:02:15| I've always been incredibly impressed with the vision and the commitment to excellence that he's brought to this effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=135)|
| 0:02:21| as well as the due diligence in trying to make sure that it's just right, and I think we're really close to that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=141)|
| 0:02:28| We're here today specifically because Mr. Clayton reached out to us to brainstorm on some possible sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=148)|
| 0:02:34| particularly those owned by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| We focused on the area just to the east of Mary Costa Plaza up to the site of the present safety building for KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=157)|
| 0:02:46| We were already committed to building a new facility, and that location seemed ideal for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| It was a great opportunity to provide incredible educational opportunities for people in nearby inner-city neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=172)|
| 0:02:59| and we thought that was a tremendous plus, plus they had the availability of parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| and the near downtown central location accessible by lots of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| So what I'm going to do now is turn this over to David Brace, who's going to describe the site and the process ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=188)|
| 0:03:14| Then you'll hear about the vision from the Clayton team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| and I just want to end with how excited we are about the generosity of the Clayton family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| and especially excited about what a facility like this can do for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| I've seen what it can do for other cities, and in fact, over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| I've been approached many times by people saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| why can't we have something like CityX has as a museum or a science facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=216)|
| 0:03:42| especially one where young people could become excited and engaged in science and the STEM disciplines early?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=222)|
| 0:03:49| So, David, I'll turn it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| I will remind council, please, when you question or speak, speak into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| So this is being recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| Thank you very much, members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| I will turn the lights off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=243)|
| 0:04:10| Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| Is that better, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| Thank you very much, Bill and members of council, and obviously the Clayton team is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| So let's talk about the site, and then we will talk about steps moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| So we have an overhead area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| When the Clayton family, when Jim Clayton and his team came to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| this was a site of real interest, and as Bill indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| the need for a new KPD, KFD facility, an office building training facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| is a top priority, as Mayor Rojero has indicated in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| And so when you look at the site, there are about 12 total acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| That includes the green space between garages B and C near the Maricosta Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| There's 3.8 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| Then there is a road, and then there is a large surface lot for the KPD safety building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| and the municipal court, and then there is a side lot that's 2.5 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| that kind of curves around on the southeast portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| So there's three parcels that the city, and again, we will get into the details of next steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=320)|
| 0:05:28| but the city has communicated that the Clayton team and their designers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| should look at that entire canvas, look at the entire area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| and determine the best location for the facility that they hope and have a vision for in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=338)|
| 0:05:47| There's been quite a bit of discussion of the benefits of building something closer to the garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| There is a topographical change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| There's a hill that you walk up if you park in the garages up to the existing safety facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| And so the entire site is open for the Clayton team to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| and to study once a development agreement is signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=366)|
| 0:06:12| The KPD building, obviously the questions are what are the impacts on KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| and I would say at this point we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| I know that Chief Gass is here, and Dr. Lyons and I met with Chief Thomas this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| to talk about projects, specifically this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| And so the scenario with KPD ideally would be that KPD stays in that current location temporarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=386)|
| 0:06:36| and has to move later once their building is designed and built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| But the Clayton team obviously may require that KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| they may choose that upper hill location as the prime museum location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| which would necessitate the police department moving temporarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| That's not ideal, and I think Cindy, Chief Gass, and her team know that that's a struggle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=415)|
| 0:07:02| but it's a struggle that we believe is worth the effort for the incredible opportunity we have with the Clayton team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=422)|
| 0:07:11| So they will study the site, and at a future date we will come back to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| with actually a purchase and sales agreement once they determine the best location for the museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| Let me go to the next slide here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| Let me back up actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| One of the advantages of this site is that it is directly next to over 2,000 parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=447)|
| 0:07:36| So you see Garage B, Garage C, and then just outside you can see the corner of Garage A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| And so one real advantage is that parking, especially during the day, is completely underutilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=462)|
| 0:07:50| I think during the day there's a couple hundred spaces that are used mostly by city employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| but we have nearly 2,500 spaces that are open and available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| allowing the Clayton team to invest a significant amount of their money into the museum project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=479)|
| 0:08:06| Yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| Can I ask a question while you're still talking about the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| So there's been plans and speculation and proposals to build a new civic coliseum or add-on or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=489)|
| 0:08:20| Given 12 acres to this project, would that still allow room for that to be done on this site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=500)|
| 0:08:27| I think what we've, in the negotiations on the development agreement, we'll talk about what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| and Charles Swanson is here as well if we need to talk about some of the legalese with the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| What I think the original negotiations were, tell us where the museum needs to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=518)|
| 0:08:45| knowing that we need a site to potentially build a future arena, coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| Mr. Clayton, Jim, did ask, well, what if my project is big enough that I want the whole site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| And what we said was, well, let us know what that proposal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| If the proposal is that significant and it warrants the entire site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| then we would need to weigh that with the need for a potential parcel to build a future arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=543)|
| 0:09:12| We would also want to look at, and I've talked to at least one designer about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| is the possibility if a future mayor and council choose to fund an arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=558)|
| 0:09:25| could you remove the existing arena and replace a new one right on that existing pad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| I don't know if it's large enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| But those are some of the questions that the city will have to dig into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| But it's a bit premature until Jim and his team can actually do detailed site analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| schematic design, and some feasibility work on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| So I think, again, the canvas is open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| and the designers will work with Jim and the Clayton team to figure out where best to site a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| and then we will talk about it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=597)|
| 0:10:04| So let's talk next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| And, again, there's some wiggle room with these steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| July or August, we're having ongoing development agreement discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=610)|
| 0:10:16| That includes Dr. Lyons, Allison Dyer, and Charles Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| as well as the Clayton team and their attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| So we've got a few attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| We've got more non-attorneys than attorneys, so hopefully we will move forward pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| So we will continue to negotiate and talk about the development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| so that we can bring a draft development agreement to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| Again, that could be the end of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| It could be the first part of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| But we would bring that agreement, an agreement that both parties are comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| I think it's important to note that the development agreement is really an important step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| not only for the city but for the Clayton team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| The next step will involve the Clayton team spending some significant resources on detailed site design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=658)|
| 0:11:05| building a team, designers, and other engineering design professionals, feasibility study, parking study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=665)|
| 0:11:13| So the development agreement is important for both parties to understand the path forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| It's also important for the Clayton team to know that the city is committed enough to the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| that it's worth them spending those resources to look at it in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| And so we would bring a development agreement to city council for a resolution for the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| to enter into an agreement with the Clayton Family Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| Once that happens, the Clayton team would then start to assemble all the folks that need to be on that team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| Jim is here and can talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| Most projects would have some type of project manager, an architect, the various civil and mechanical engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=708)|
| 0:11:56| potentially some geotechnical folks, someone to look at the feasibility, how many folks will come to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=716)|
| 0:12:03| So that team gets assembled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| And then there is a due diligence period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| So the Clayton team, and that could be, again, we're negotiating what that time schedule is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| It could be six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| It could be eight months to do that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| Once that work is done, then the Clayton team comes back to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| And I've shown that in the first or second quarter of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| They bring what the development agreement now calls a comprehensive proposal with renderings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=744)|
| 0:12:31| not necessarily construction documents because things could change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| but a comprehensive proposal that the city would then look at and approve, negotiate, ultimately approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=754)|
| 0:12:42| Upon approval, the city would then issue a notice to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| And then there's many other parts and pieces that would come in at that point, like a sales, a purchase and sales agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| There could be a more detailed parking agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| One of the key concerns that I know Jim and the Clayton team have is, hey, we may need 1,000 spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| and we want to make sure our investment is protected on those spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| so a future administration doesn't come in and decide they need those spaces for something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| So, you know, there's risk on both ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| How do we manage that risk in a development agreement, purchase and sales agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| how we actually transfer the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| There's quite a bit of work, but that's the very preliminary next steps for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=798)|
| 0:13:25| All right, I'll jump into the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| Just general information, I know there's been lots of chatter and information out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| Mr. Clayton has done a number of TV interviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| and people are interested and excited about Knoxville having this incredible and generous gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| So what is the anticipated building size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| We don't know 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| I think that is part of the due diligence phase is to look at the site, look at the building form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| But Mr. Clayton has indicated anywhere from 80,000 to 150,000 square feet for a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| Again, part of the design challenge, the methodology for an architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| and other design professionals would be to look at the site, look at the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| and determine what the size of the building should be based on their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| Another question that I've heard is what is Mr. Clayton and the Clayton Foundation's investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| It's a $100 million investment of construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| It's incredibly generous, and we're very fortunate to be in this opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| to be sitting here with this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| And then the dedication of a $50 million endowment to support operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| There will be ticket prices to attend the museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| That will cover some operating, but the endowment is set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| I think what Mr. Clayton has said to us is we don't want another entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| that has to do significant fundraising to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| And so the $50 million endowment, again, is for operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| How long has Mr. Clayton envisioned the science museum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| Really, I put about a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| He's visited the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| Jim and Michelle have visited over 20 museums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| I believe they were on the road yesterday, flew to, I believe it was Dallas, Texas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| got back about midnight last night, flew to Dallas, spent some time with those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| not only in the United States but over in Europe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| So Mr. Clayton is going to show you quite a few images of some of the things he envisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| Again, the design process will flesh out what the building form looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| and then there's a separate process for the exhibits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| I mean, the building is one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| The exhibits are a whole other specialty design process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| and there are some slides later of what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| And then this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| Who will the Knox Science Museum serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| And again, the plan that Mr. Clayton has proposed is to design and build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| and operate as a gift to our community a regional, state-of-the-art,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| world-class educational science and discovery center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| And Mr. Clayton has talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| He wants it to serve everyone from pre-K through seniors, and he wants it to touch all folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=966)|
| 0:16:14| One important component that will be in the development agreement that Mr. Clayton is committed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| and passionate about is serving city kids that are low to moderate income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| making sure that those kids have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| And I think I know that he's committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| How that works out, he asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| He said, now how do we make that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| And so we'll have to figure out what that looks like, but I know that's a commitment for the Clayton family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| and it's an important commitment for the city to make sure that low to moderate income kids can come to the museum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| and participate and make sure that that's in the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| So I don't know if there's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| Obviously this is ongoing Q&A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| We're going to transition to Mr. Clayton, but if there's questions right now about what we've talked to at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| I've got a question, Mr. Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| So the $100 million is towards the construction and the design of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| What thought has been towards the funding of the exhibits inside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| Well, the $100 million would include exhibits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| Mr. Clayton could talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| I think the little bit of research I've done is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| exhibits could be anywhere from $20 million to $25 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| They could be a significant amount of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| But the $100 million is for the building and the exhibits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| And if I've got that wrong, Mr. Clayton will correct me, but that's a turnkey for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1050)|
| 0:17:37| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| Well, what we're going to do is transition here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| I believe Mr. Clayton and some of his team are going to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| And they sent a number of, you know, one of the questions that I had that we hope to solve today for council is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1067)|
| 0:17:54| what is a science museum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| I've got three kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| I've been to a few in the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| but some folks in the community might not know what a science museum is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| And so I believe Jim is going to make a few comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| and then we're going to look at some images of museums that he's visited and is impressed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1086)|
| 0:18:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| David, Bill, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| Appreciate the invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| Appreciate your time and your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| As you've heard, this is a $150 million project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| with $50 million of it being the endowment so that we don't have to beg for money ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1108)|
| 0:18:36| The operating budget will be about $10 million, and about 40% of that will come from the endowment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1116)|
| 0:18:45| So the ticket sales and food services, events, there will be small conventions and business meetings of all kinds there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1125)|
| 0:19:01| It will be on the bus stop for buses on the way to Gatlinburg, Pigeon Fords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1141)|
| 0:19:09| And so there will be some income opportunities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| But the larger amount of the income comes from ticket sales and especially annual family memberships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1154)|
| 0:19:23| There may be corporate memberships also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| We've seen different science museums handle these memberships in different manners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1168)|
| 0:19:39| Actually, they all vary in size and vary in scope and vary on focus, but there's real commonality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1179)|
| 0:19:52| and that's why we keep visiting so many, and we've formed alliances with a lot of the leaders in the world-class museums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1192)|
| 0:20:02| And we want the best of the best here and are working diligently to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1202)|
| 0:20:13| As I think was said, we've visited three of them in Europe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| What led me to this decision other than working on at least three teams over the years that had great ideas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1218)|
| 0:20:31| Mr. Haslam paid $100,000 on a feasibility study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| Clayton Holmes paid $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| I paid $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| And Rajad Jibran, $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| So we spent $325,000 on a feasibility study about 10, 12 years ago, and it was really well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1243)|
| 0:20:54| As a matter of fact, Susan Brown was the point person representing the community with all the consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1254)|
| 0:21:01| and it was very impressive, but we couldn't raise any money after it was all done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1261)|
| 0:21:10| So we wanted to eliminate that, so we've waited until we sold some banks and sold Clayton Holmes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1270)|
| 0:21:18| The money is in the bank to do everything that we're talking about right now, today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1278)|
| 0:21:25| So we are ready and anxious to get this project started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1285)|
| 0:21:31| We're totally committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| But what led me here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| If we look at Korea, China, India, and a few other countries, they may be overtaking us on science and technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1295)|
| 0:21:45| That's a horrible thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| But in some cases, they may be even some areas may even be a bit ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1308)|
| 0:21:56| Having a degree in electrical engineering, I don't want that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| And then what led me here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| Several years ago, somebody said, and I think Haslam and I were at the same meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| We walked away from that meeting repeating this over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| Some of you have heard probably Haslam say it more times than I have, but learn, earn, and return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1333)|
| 0:22:20| So when we're young, if we're able to learn, and I'll talk about that for me in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| If you learn, you should be able to earn, and I was lucky enough to learn and earn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| So if that is the case, then you certainly should return at some point in your life, and that's where I am now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1352)|
| 0:22:42| But then when I did get to returning, I was in many cases pleased, many cases disappointed, because there just isn't accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1362)|
| 0:22:55| Many times there isn't measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| There's no way to determine were the results that you invested for that were committed, were they actually achieved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1377)|
| 0:23:07| And that gets to be a very difficult subject, and philanthropists, people involved in philanthropy keep talking about that all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1387)|
| 0:23:14| how frustrating that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| You write the check, and then are the results actually achieved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| Let me branch off on my story for just a moment, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| Sharecropper's son, my brother Joe, that some of you know, and I grew up on a small cotton farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1406)|
| 0:23:34| Sharecropping meant that the landowner got 50% of all the crops that we earned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| It's a real tough way to make a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| So I left the cotton patch the day that I got out of high school, went to Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| and was lucky enough to land a job the day that I got there as a helper or a trainee for the utility company there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1428)|
| 0:24:05| Then the first day at work, I went home, packed up, came back for the first day at work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1445)|
| 0:24:14| I was paired with a young electrical engineer who had won all kinds of accolades in college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1454)|
| 0:24:26| He helped me fill out the orientation benefit papers and insurance and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1466)|
| 0:24:34| We bonded at that orientation meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| I'm going to just tell you what that relationship has meant to me down through the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1478)|
| 0:24:45| His name was Bill Westfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| So Bill became my very generous mentor, and soon we were spending every non-working hour that we weren't sleeping in his hobby shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1487)|
| 0:25:01| experimenting and discovering and working with science of all kinds, electronics, mechanics, radio, a lot of radio, and television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1501)|
| 0:25:14| Before long, he was talking to me about college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| At first, I just knew that teachers and preachers went away to school, but I never thought about college or knew anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1517)|
| 0:25:27| But he is insisting that I go visit Memphis State with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| He took me over there for a visit and signed me up for a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| So I spent three or four quarters there, and then he brought me here, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| and signed me up at the University of Tennessee for a degree in electrical engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| It's just unbelievable what that young man meant to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| I'll be eternally grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| He even introduced me to a pilot who took me flying for the first time, and I was hooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| I got the disease really bad and haven't been able to get over it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| As a matter of fact, I haven't tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| My son, Kevin, I'll mention in a moment, is an avid pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| We've been accused of building businesses and soliciting customers so we'd be able to fly more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1578)|
| 0:26:27| But flying now is science and technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| It's a lot about geometry, a lot about weather, and all kinds of scientific principles are applicable in flying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1591)|
| 0:26:41| I'm active today at age 84, and I fly jets, single pilot, helicopter, and gliders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1601)|
| 0:26:53| Kevin Clayton is an avid pilot too, but he is just as passionate about this project as I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1613)|
| 0:27:01| He'll be co-chairman of the Science Center and the Clayton Family Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1621)|
| 0:27:17| I'm really proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| He founded the Clayton Bradley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| I just wonder, anybody ever been to the Clayton Bradley Academy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| You have to be pleased and impressed with what they're doing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| It's STEM for a lot of science involved there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| Before I leave flying, just for a second, a big article today in the Wall Street Journal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| There's a huge shortage of pilots now and getting a more serious problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1664)|
| 0:27:53| So in this Science Center, planned now are three simulators so that people of all ages will be able to step into the simulator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1673)|
| 0:28:04| and have a real, actual flying experience, just like I do annually when I go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| I don't want to put the hours and put my airplane through what we do in the simulator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| so we use the simulators to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| People will have the opportunity to have a thrill if they want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| or they can fly straight and level if they want to, but people will be able to fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| I'm telling you, for a lot of people, for me and my son, it was catching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1710)|
| 0:28:37| We caught it that bad 65 years ago for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| But Kevin and I, I'm almost through now, going longer than I meant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| but Kevin and I and the Clayton family are totally committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| As I said, the funds are at First Bank right now, today in the trust department, invested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| and there will not have to be any fundraising to accomplish any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| The Clayton Family Foundation is a 501C3, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| but the Knox Science Museum will be a separate 501C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1749)|
| 0:29:16| It will have its own board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| It will have its own life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| but the endowment will be committed and contained, managed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1762)|
| 0:29:31| in the Clayton Family Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| but there will be documents committing the foundation to support the operating cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1775)|
| 0:29:46| It won't be real easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| You have to submit the budget and you have to submit the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| The board of the science museum will show that they're operating in an acceptable business manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1793)|
| 0:30:06| and the funds for operations will be there on and on in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| I can't say the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| Let me—so Kevin and I and the Clayton family are totally committed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| and we want to support youth learning, talent discovery, learning for all ages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1823)|
| 0:30:31| and just as mentoring and all that, just like Bill Westphal did for me back in the 50s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1831)|
| 0:30:43| I've referred to this already, but as I say here, this area is so blessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1843)|
| 0:30:51| because when people completed their careers at these great organizations located here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1851)|
| 0:31:00| and I've mentioned some of them already, they don't leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| Not many. We stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| I'll be here always as long as I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| And what a blessing that that is, and we see many of the science centers really taking advantage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1872)|
| 0:31:20| Really nobody's taking advantage of anybody because seniors sometimes are bored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1880)|
| 0:31:27| Seniors love to be engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| Seniors love to have the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| They love to—and so some of the science centers give them all of that opportunity to become involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1892)|
| 0:31:45| and engaged with in teaching and mentoring and sharing all of the knowledge and experience that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1905)|
| 0:31:58| In many of the science centers, it seems the general rule is that if you volunteer half a day a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| then you have all of the benefits then of being a volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| They have various names, and some have uniforms, but it's a great community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1931)|
| 0:32:19| and most of them will have once a month or once a quarter some sort of social event for the volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1939)|
| 0:32:29| where they are recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| Michelle and I just—which one? I can't remember right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| I just visited one a week or two ago where each volunteer has to move from one set to another every 45 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1956)|
| 0:32:50| They might be working on electronics, turning on lights and bells and music and whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1970)|
| 0:32:57| and then they might move to hydraulics, and then they might move to the aviation unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| and then they might move to the medical, and we'll be showing you slides of that so that they are not bored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| and they get to keep learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| We thought that takes a lot of structure to make all that work, but talk about happy volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1990)|
| 0:33:18| They really were thrilled to be engaged and to be part of all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=1998)|
| 0:33:29| And finally, I just want to make a couple of promises to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| I and my family will never, ever profit or benefit, take a dividend or a distribution from the Science Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2015)|
| 0:33:47| Never, never, ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| And here's the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| Ability to pay, it will not be a factor on who gets to participate, who gets to learn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2032)|
| 0:34:02| who gets to discover, who gets to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| The schools where there are children that can't afford it, the communities that can't afford it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| they will have the opportunity to be engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| There will be a mobile unit that will, it's part of marketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| If you take the mobile unit out to the school, hopefully the kids are going to have a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2061)|
| 0:34:30| It's designed for that, and they'll want to bring Ma and Pa and Grandma and Grandpa and Uncle Nan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| and the whole family to the Science Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| But there will be two or three efforts to outreach in a manner like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2080)|
| 0:34:49| That's where I'm coming from, and I really appreciate this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2089)|
| 0:34:57| We'll go through the slides now, and I'll ask Michelle, who's my fiancée,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2097)|
| 0:35:05| and you're very passionate about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| And Susan Brown, you're going to come up here with us, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| But Michelle remembers all that we have seen better than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2112)|
| 0:35:19| And Susan has recently accepted a position as a philanthropic director for Clayton Homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2119)|
| 0:35:28| and for the Clayton Family Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| She's really well known in the area, been a friend of ours for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| But she will be the point person all during construction, planning and construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2137)|
| 0:35:48| She'll be the point person, and hopefully we'll stay on in a leadership position after that's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| And so we'll talk about the slides now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| Number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Thank you, Mr. Clayton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| We'll go through these kind of fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| Where's this, Michelle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| This is in Union City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| It's Discovery Park of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| They have quite an impressive building, as you can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| They have 11 buildings, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| This is just the main building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| Michelle, if you could, give us your name so we can record it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| Michelle Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| Michelle's an accountant, and she's wearing my ring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| This is just so that you can get an idea about the exteriors that we've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| This is in Raleigh, North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| Impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Yeah, and I think we also, I think Mr. Clayton wanted to show kind of an urban space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| versus a more rural space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| The first one in Union City was more of a rural space, and then obviously the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| A hundred acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Yeah, a hundred acres, a larger site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| Mr. Kirkland of the Kirkland Department of the Storage funded this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| It's roughly our model, and he established an endowment for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| It's on a hundred-acre field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| It's just amazing to drive outside of town to the countryside and see this there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2226)|
| 0:37:12| It's very successful, and they're doing right at a half a million visitors a year now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| and they're in their fourth year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| Raleigh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| This was where we were yesterday, the Perot Museum in Dallas, Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| They had quite the creative architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| They're about four years, four or five years old, and they are cutting edge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2253)|
| 0:37:40| but they've also had some growing pains, great learning opportunities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| Susan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| Susan Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| They started in their first year with 1.2 million visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| and they are now after about year five at around 800,000, but they're ramping back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| We spent the day there yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| Their exhibit executive is remarkable, and he spent the day with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2279)|
| 0:38:06| Some lessons learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| They have traveling exhibit spaces, as we will have in this museum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| but they've been retrofitting their permanent collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| His advice was when you retrofit a permanent collection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| market it just like you would a traveling exhibit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| and so they're starting to see their attendance ramp back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| as they renovate certain spaces within theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| They also had a gym collection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| and I know that Jim is working with some local businesses here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| Separate your gyms there, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| J-E-M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| She's talking about gyms and gyms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| The pretty ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| Jim's been talking with Jewelry TV and other businesses within Knoxville to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| how can we showcase and perhaps borrow some collections that are already existing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| and we showcase those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| Then you talk about the science behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| Bill Kaufman at Jewelry Television is very excited about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| and he's an avid collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| It's unbelievable the gemstones of big ones, little ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2337)|
| 0:39:04| that he would like to display there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| Good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| This is the pinnacle of all science museums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| This is kind of a teaser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| I don't know that we can get to their level ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| but this is in Chicago, Illinois, the Museum of Science and Industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| This will give you an idea of how big their lobby is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| This is just their entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| 600,000 square feet, I believe, there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| The Ross Perot is 180,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| Our target, as David alluded to earlier, is 150,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2373)|
| 0:39:42| This is in Los Angeles, California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| Look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| This is the Space Shuttle Endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| I don't know if you remember years ago when they closed the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| and brought the space shuttle down the streets of Los Angeles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| This is where it's housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| Twenty-three trips into space with that shuttle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| It was neat to learn about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| The Mars Rover is a replica in Denver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| It's neat to learn about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| I'll let Jim talk about aviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| You'll see too much aviation in the slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| There won't be that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| I took a picture of aviation all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| You know who will probably have a locomotive in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| so here we have a locomotive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| But there to the right is a real live 727 retired airliner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| I forgot, 35,000 hours on that airliner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| You can walk up the stairs and in to the front of the airplane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| walk down the aisles, sit around for a while if you want to, and then exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| Kids may have never been in an airline before, but they get to experience that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| Where airplanes were, Michelle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| Los Angeles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| They had a lot of airplanes there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| More in Chicago, another view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| This is a cross-section of an engine in Miami.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| You can see all the moving parts in that engine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| rotating slowly and see how the engine works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| This was a health exhibit in Chicago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| It's based on the bodies exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| You may be familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| And it's plastilization is the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| and this is an actual human body and its circulatory system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| And we would like to do a good outreach with help like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| That was a traveling exhibit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| No, that's their permanent exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| It's based on that same process, plastilization, that they use for the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| We went to it. I thought it was traveling when we went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| In Chicago, I think that part of it is permanent, but the bodies did travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| It is the bodies. It's their permanent exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| I'm confused. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| This is an exhibit that shows the difference between an MRI, a CAT scan, X-ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2528)|
| 0:42:15| You will pull that across the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| and you can see how the different images and how physicians use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| Not a good slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| Not a good slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| And this is another form of the plastilization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2544)|
| 0:42:30| which is an actual body cross-section that they have in Dallas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| Those are actual body organs that have been preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| We saw that yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| And then this is Jim's favorite of the guy who's wearing a full metal suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2560)|
| 0:42:47| I mentioned that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| They demonstrate lightening and how to arrest it and take it to ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2568)|
| 0:42:58| Every day there will be presentations like this on health and different scientific topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2578)|
| 0:43:06| There will be visiting professors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| They run right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| These successful science centers are able to attract noted speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2594)|
| 0:43:21| Some of them are selling their books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| but there are lots of very educating speakers available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2604)|
| 0:43:33| These next couple of slides are simplistic examples of science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| They're called tabletop exhibits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| and that's where the kids can get in there really hands-on and learn about science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| Wiring up circuits and connecting it up for pneumatics that connect up airlines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| and make motors turn with air and make motors turn with electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| A lot of ways to power and a lot of ways to control instrumentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| These exhibits are really about the science, not necessarily technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| but about the basics of science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| This is a good exhibit that brings the river system in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| We have the wonderful Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| We'd like to do an exhibit that brings the river inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| We've mentioned this to TVA already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| but we would like people to learn more about the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| This is an example of what that might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| This is a hands-on, same with the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| These are called water tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| Everybody has one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| This is just one of my personal favorites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| It was a wall, a living wall in Boston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| and it talked about the science of engineering this wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| That's alive and it's three stories tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| Beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| Yeah, the pictures you can't do it justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| In Chicago, they had a lot of agriculture was one of their exhibit focuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2706)|
| 0:45:13| the science behind agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| Combine, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| Combine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| Combine that people can walk through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| Yeah, the kids can get in it, and the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| it makes them feel like they're actually harvesting corn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| It was well-received by the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| Robots, as you would expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| Interactive robots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| Everybody is interested in robots nowadays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| and those exhibits are really well-received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| That robot's playing tic-tac-toe and beats everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| And a common exhibit is the tornado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| As you can see, there's one in Durham, North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| There's Chicago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Every museum has this, and it's always a big draw for the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| They can get in it and play, and I think that's pretty cute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| This is the science behind waves, one of the best we've seen done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| This was very visual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| Back to lightning, you can put your hand close to the globe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| and electricity comes to your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2780)|
| 0:46:28| I love this honeybee exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| I know it's not pretty, but it's the science behind honeybees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| You can learn more than you want to know about honeybees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| As you can tell, it's very diverse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| and it's what I like to bring all aspects of science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| This is just some gemstones, minerals in Denver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| And play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| You have to have an element of play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| Kids love to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| We want them to be able to build buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| More play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| We've got to have a big shop because we've got to make some of our own exhibits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| because as we mature, we'll make more of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| The Museum of Minnesota will build several exhibits for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| They did for Perot and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| That's one of their income sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| They're very, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| This is just an example of a theater in Raleigh that was well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2850)|
| 0:47:37| It was almost two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| The projection on the wall was over two stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| and you sat in the chairs and they played movies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| It was not an additional cost, was one of the things I liked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| but everybody could go and enjoy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| It was well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| I'll turn the track lighting back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| Thank you, Ms. Clayton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| Questions, observations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| Sounds like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| Thanks so much, Mr. Clayton, and to your team as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| Unlike Mr. Brace, I am not as familiar with science museums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| I'm very excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| I'm just wondering, I believe that there's a science museum in Oak Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| and I know we have the Muse here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| so I don't know if someone could kind of speak to how this will integrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| or supplant or sort of how does that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| when there are existing science museums in the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| I know that Ellie, there's Ellie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| Hello, Ellie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| Ellie is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| She's Executive Director with the Muse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| and so that was a question that Dr. Lyons and I and Mr. Swanson brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| Obviously, part of our job is to help with collaboration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| and Jim and Michelle and now Susan obviously are familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2938)|
| 0:49:04| They're financial supporters of the Muse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| and they've expressed an interest in working directly with the Muse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| and being collaborative with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| I think it's important to note as well that the Muse is also providing much of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| on a smaller scale right now, so they're meeting the current need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| and obviously the need that will be in place over the next couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| we can't forget about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| That's still got to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| and that service they provide especially to the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| and surrounding school systems is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| So I'm not sure if Jim wants to say any more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| but I know that collaboration is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| We love Ellie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| No, I don't know about the Oak Ridge Museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| I've not had any discussions with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| We're not really current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| You know, it's in transition right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| We're excited about seeing the finished product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| and there's plenty of opportunity for us to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| We want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| I'm remanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| We have a meeting with them on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| We're meeting at Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| I just want to take a moment to thank you, Mr. Clayton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| and your team for being here today to share on this level your vision that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| for the city of Knoxville and also for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| There's no doubt that you are very excited that you all have done your due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| that this is a passion of yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| I'm actually even more excited after seeing some of the research that you've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3043)|
| 0:50:49| and just the enthusiasm that you all bring to the table of what you want to do to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| and grow the technology and science and play experience for people of all ages in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3054)|
| 0:51:01| And so I really am getting your vision even more clearly now after seeing some of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| and I'm very excited to see where it will take us in your final drafts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| And so we very much look forward to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| Anything we can do to assist you in that process, please let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| Thank you, Bill and David, for your due diligence and the work that it takes to get us to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| But I just want to let you know that we certainly appreciate your investment in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| and in our young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| I just wanted to say, Mr. Clayton, thank you as well for this phenomenal opportunity that you're presenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3090)|
| 0:51:41| I particularly think of education first, like you mentioned in your presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3101)|
| 0:51:48| and making sure that we're exciting the youth in our region with science| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| and all the things that they can accomplish in their very young lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| looking ahead with the advances that we'll hopefully continue to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| My question was mainly that in the presentation I saw a lot about kind of general science| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3124)|
| 0:52:10| and certainly what we'd be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| Aviation obviously played a big role in your presentation, surprisingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| But other things that you would kind of see, electricity, I'm sure there'd be some magnetism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3137)|
| 0:52:26| things like that that you'd be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| Do you envision anything with regard to the science and technological innovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3148)|
| 0:52:37| that we've seen and discoveries here in our region, when you think about heavy elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3157)|
| 0:52:43| or any of the other research that's been done primarily at Oak Ridge National Laboratory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| but also when you're looking at energy and TVA and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| Maybe could you talk a little bit about whether you see kind of a regional experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3173)|
| 0:53:00| that folks might be able to have as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| I would just say that in the previous attempts to accomplish this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| some really fine people and some fine groups worked on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| The people of Oak Ridge and TVA and other organizations were very, very interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3195)|
| 0:53:28| in being engaged for recruiting, for showing what they do and what they have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3208)|
| 0:53:46| In visiting Perot nearly two years ago and then going back yesterday in Dallas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3226)|
| 0:53:53| we saw corporations have become engaged in a huge manner of showing the technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3233)|
| 0:54:04| behind their products and what they stand for and what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3244)|
| 0:54:12| It was very interesting, and the synergy in those relationships is just obvious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3252)|
| 0:54:19| and very, very, very important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| People are interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| Let's see, all the time I'm telling people about the technology of touch tablets, computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3267)|
| 0:54:43| and people even around here don't know it came from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3283)|
| 0:54:50| I love to tell people, oh, we invented that back home in Knoxville, right there at Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3290)|
| 0:54:58| Energy and all of the technology that we can find that comes out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| I mentioned Jewelry Television, just the fact that there must be something scientific about diamonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3304)|
| 0:55:14| and they want to do that and teach us, teach me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| I don't know exactly where diamonds come from, but I would love to read about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3319)|
| 0:55:27| and hear a program on it about that some night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| I know that Jewelry Television would like to do that for us, that kind of engaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3332)|
| 0:55:39| This is something that Susan would be very good at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3339)|
| 0:55:46| Well, thank you very much for your obvious passion for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| Mr. Starr, do you want to ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| I don't know who this question is really for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| It's a very, very exciting project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| I guess talk a little bit about the site selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| Were there other sites considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| Looking at the site, to me the one concern, the way the auditorium works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| you feel like a lot of people drive to the parking lots, go into the facility, and then get back and drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3369)|
| 0:56:17| Will there be a plan to try to activate the area around it with potential other development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3377)|
| 0:56:25| or is it still too premature for that discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| Yeah, I will deal with that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| Thank you, Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| For the first part, of course, we don't have that much city-owned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| Now, we did consider, obviously, we have some potential, you know, did along Jackson and other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| We were really looking more for private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| But what really jumped out about this, of course, had an appeal to the Clayton team as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| was its proximity, you know, to downtown, to the community, to East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3409)|
| 0:56:57| Also, the availability of the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| Otherwise, we would have to find a place, either a great expense with constructing garages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| or what we don't want to have is a lot of valuable land used up, you know, covered with asphalt supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| So a lot of things fell in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| Also, we'd already decided to move forward on finding a location for KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| So, you know, we had a good swath of land, and we thought a lot about potential development opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3438)|
| 0:57:26| We wanted to make sure, given the history of the area, even back to urban renewal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| that something came back as a real positive for the community that everybody could benefit from and see as a real asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3451)|
| 0:57:38| So a lot of it was practical, availability, location, parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| and also the fact we don't really have other sites that we don't control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| Now, the Clayton team themselves did their own exploration of possible sites over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| And over the decade that we've been in and out of discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| at one time we thought about the old convention center that's obviously become not available anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| I mean, there's been many iterations of possible sitings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| So that's how we ended up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| And I think we are open to design around the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| We want to, again, make it something that is a real plus for the whole city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| but also for downtown and for the proximate neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| Yeah, and I think one other point on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| One of the challenges with the area is that it is not used during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| Many of the events at the Coliseum and Auditorium are used in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| So activating this space with activity during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3513)|
| 0:58:38| but knowing that much of that day space may be school buses and buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| So being slightly across James White Parkway with direct access from James White Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3523)|
| 0:58:49| the ability to drop off students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| So the parking's there, good in and out access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| but also activating that space we think will have a market impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| And folks that come during the summer and are on vacation and want to go to the museum are going to want to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| And so we do hope, we believe there will be benefits to downtown across James White Parkway as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3543)|
| 0:59:11| I wanted to add one other thing that was a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| That's the transit centers being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| As much as we want visitors and appreciate the regional visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| we want to make it real easy for all folks to get to this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| I actually park there, and it's pretty busy in the morning on the trolley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3562)|
| 0:59:29| I mean, sometimes there will be 20, 25 people waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| Yeah, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| And it's a short walk, too, if you need to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| Once you do it a few times, you can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| I wanted to follow up on one point, and I'm not sure which one to direct this to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| But certainly Mr. Clayton's presentation, and then it was just mentioned there, about the school buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| Have there been any discussions with Knox County Schools about the ways that this center could be used to advance their curriculum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3589)|
| 0:59:57| And I know Mr. Clayton mentioned he really wanted to try to make sure that we were getting access to students inside the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3597)|
| 1:00:05| that might not necessarily have had these type of experiences in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| and that this would be a great way for them to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| I guess, have you had any conversations with the county schools about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| The city has not at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| Now, I'm going to look over at Ellie, the Muse, who is the existing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| And again, that's a small facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| That's under 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| It's a city facility, and we've supported the Muse prior to that, the Discovery Center, East Tennessee Discovery Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3631)|
| 1:00:37| Actually, it used to be in the Candy Factory many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| The Muse does serve a student population, mostly K-5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3641)|
| 1:00:48| but I do anticipate, obviously, Ellie and her team and the Clayton team working together to make sure that the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3648)|
| 1:00:59| not only K-5, but I know Mr. Clayton has a desire for K-college and seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| But yes, I think the school system will be approached, especially as this starts to take form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3665)|
| 1:01:12| Again, the development agreement is the real step that Mr. Clayton and his team need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| to feel comfortable spending that next level of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| And that investment, they want to know the city's truly committed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| and that's important for us to say, yeah, we're committed to this site and to the work that you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3683)|
| 1:01:31| And so the development agreement does that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| knowing that Mr. Clayton's work would then come back to us in a comprehensive plan that the city would look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3693)|
| 1:01:39| Yeah, this is going to be a phenomenal asset to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| Just its being here, aside from all the programming opportunities that I'm sure we take advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| This is not a question to be answered right now, because I know that it's premature at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3711)|
| 1:02:00| I would imagine that a development agreement needs to be in place first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| But as the process moves forward, I'm very interested in hearing about kind of the community process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3723)|
| 1:02:10| that will be in place around how the site is utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| That site has a lot of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| And so honoring that, I think there will need to be some community process in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3736)|
| 1:02:22| And then just kind of regular updates on how the site, how the building size will be determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3742)|
| 1:02:32| and how the exhibit space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| I mean, some of that is not in the purview of city council, and I totally understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| But just I think because this is a piece of city property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| I just have a special interest in kind of staying updated on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| So I'm not sure how that will work once we get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| We'll be very proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| We definitely agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| And we've utilized other blogs and that sort of thing to keep everything up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3774)|
| 1:03:01| But we'll make regular presentations to council, I think, and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| I think this is such an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| There will be so much excitement that we can't drop the ball on the communication side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| You raise some very important issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| And the development agreement discusses that concept of a public meeting, public outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| That ain't part of our job in the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| That's really what we get paid to do is to – this is Mr. Clayton's money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| and we've got to help make that connection with communications with council and the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| And so we'll be integrated throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| And that will in many ways be our role, is to help make sure that we respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3812)|
| 1:03:38| and communicate the history to the Clayton team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| We also routinely update council, that we help host additional workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| We make sure that folks in the community understand the desire for access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| I think Mr. Clayton mentioned that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| that the ability to pay will not stop city folks from being able to access the museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| And that's incredibly generous as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| So some of those process pieces will be included in the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| The development agreement is going to discuss a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| Again, the development agreement is to give Mr. Clayton, the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3849)|
| 1:04:15| the comfort that we're committed enough to spend the next several hundred thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3855)|
| 1:04:21| doing all the things that Mr. Clayton and his team need to do to make this project successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| Detailed site analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| It could be geotechnical borings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| It could be hiring architects, electrical engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| whoever he needs to really make sure that this project is successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| So that due diligence will produce – it won't be full construction documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3877)|
| 1:04:43| It will produce a set of design documents and a study that we can then look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3883)|
| 1:04:49| to feel comfortable that we've addressed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| And there is a community piece in that six-month process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| So we'll make sure that we keep you informed and that there's adequate community process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3896)|
| 1:05:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| First, I'd like to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| We're very excited to hear about the project and where we're going and moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3909)|
| 1:05:15| My family is probably one of your top target audiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| My husband seeks out these museums everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| I think he had his birthday at the National Air and Space Museum in Dayton, Ohio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| every year through high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| So he's your target audience if you want to connect with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| And my kids are really into these kinds of museums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| We go to them everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| So we're the folks that travel and go to these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| My questions are, so July and August, that agreement that will come to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| will better identify what the site placement is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| or that's six-plus months down the road for the comprehensive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| What will we be looking at once things are more solidified, August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| and then what's the six-months-plus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| So the development agreement are guiding principles for both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| So we understand, and Mr. Clayton and his team feel comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| the city's committed to broadly this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| What should come out of that is how much of the site does Jim Clayton need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3971)|
| 1:06:17| and the Clayton Foundation need for the museum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| Where is the building going to be located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| What are the impacts on KPD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| I mean, that's very important for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| How many visitors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| They're going to start to lay out a lot of this work Mr. Clayton has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| So it's pulling that together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| and I believe Susan will be doing some of that, pulling it all together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| so that there's a clearer vision of what this looks like in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| and making sure the site is where they want to be and it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| And so that's really that six-month window that the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| It could be, I mean, again, I think we're in that process of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| how much time do you need to get your team together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| to start doing that work, and then coming back to us with this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| with some renderings and that analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| These development agreements are always tricky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| We've done a lot of them, because especially when at the end of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| the site will end up in other hands, not city hands, city property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| So we've got to ensure that once that transition is made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| that the obligations are in place and so forth on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| For instance, he knows the parking is going to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| Everybody has reasonable assurance that, A, that the science museum will be built there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| in the manner generally expressed, and we have our attorneys do a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| in overseeing putting those kind of documents together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| But it sort of controls the transition piece to ensure to everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| that what happens is what we expect to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| And the ownership is the 501c3 KSM?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| We anticipate a purchase and sales agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| probably a dollar sale to support the museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| The city's contribution would be land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| but there would be a separate purchase and sales agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| that would outline closing and transfer and all those things that go into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| very similar to what we did with many projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| Lonsdale Project with Emerald Youth and many development agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| The development agreement is the first step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| and then there's other agreements that council will see in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| as it starts to take form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| And in terms of KPD and how that happens in the scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| you will have some ideas of option A, option B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| There's things in play there that aren't ironed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| We've asked the Clayton team that as quickly as they can determine the site location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| for the building so we know the impacts for KPD, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| And so that will be a function of the architectural group looking at the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| doing some work on the site to see where best to locate the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| And then we've asked, as quickly as you know that, I think right now it says 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| It could be 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| We're not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| We're still working through the details of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| That's an important piece for us because it impacts the good folks over at KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4147)|
| 1:09:12| and Municipal Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| We need to find temporary location, which we're willing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| That is a process, and we need to get on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| So we need to move KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| If they need to temporarily relocate, well, we do siting for a new KPD facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| program, design, and build a new KPD facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| But to clarify, this is independent of where that KPD facility is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| The only thing it impacts really directly is whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| or not we need a temporary facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| But the question of the ultimate location is independent of this completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Because if the location where the KPD building currently is at this very moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| is not in play, one could start happening while KPD stays where they're at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4188)|
| 1:09:55| while option A, B, or C is exercised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| Well, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| We've had a quick overview of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| The next item on the agenda is public forum, and no one has signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| But my hunch is that Mr. Lyons and Mr. Brace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| and Mr. Clayton would probably stick around a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| and entertain your questions or your remarks or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| That being it, if there are no more questions, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180712?start=4233)|
