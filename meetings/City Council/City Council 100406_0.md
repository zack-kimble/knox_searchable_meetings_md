| 0:04:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| So, we're actually talking about 12A, postponing for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| Thanks, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| Okay, all those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| Okay, other items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| Bob, is that something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Any items to, excuse me, Mr. Dellibelby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| Yes, I think at least for discussion purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| if we could talk about 9A, the northeast county sector issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| and the 12, I believe it's I, the northeast county sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=304)|
| 0:05:10| so that we can have those in front of us at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| It might be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| I didn't say vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| I said just for discussion purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Yeah, I think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| I think we'll let each speaker clarify whether they're speaking to both items or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| and then we'll have to vote on them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| But we will ask everybody to clarify that if they're speaking on one, if it applies to both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| Anything else to deal with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| Okay, there are no consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| Real briefly on mayor's report, the 50th celebration of the Dogwood Arts Festival is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| I think there's an official lunch kickoff tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| but obviously it's one of the highlights of our year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| And some of you all have noticed all the new sculpture around downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| It's gotten some great comments, and that's part of the Dogwood exhibition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| The Dogwood Trail officially opens tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| The trail is open tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| This is Community Development Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| And earlier today, Madeline Rojero and her staff hosted a bus tour for some council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| I know several council members went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| Thank you all for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| The Neighborhood Advisory Council and the P&I Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| and it kind of toured various projects that the Community Development Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| spearheaded around the city, and we appreciate everybody that took part in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| and showed some of the housing rehabs and facade improvement programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| and neighborhood improvement projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| and turning around some chronic problem property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| So thank you for your work, and thanks for doing the tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| This past week, the Solar American Cities Program, which we're a part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| had a workshop that we did along with Pellissippi State,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| Erin Burns, who directs that, to talk about solar hot water installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| And nine days ago was the Covenant Health Knoxville Marathon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| Almost 6,000 people ran, including 900 children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| And so it was a great turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| And as usual, all the neighborhoods around Knoxville showed up to cheer people on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| So a great job to everybody that took part in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| Okay, reports from members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| Mr. Whitehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| I'd like to ask John Harris to come forward, CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| You know, over the last ten months, this council has made some decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=437)|
| 0:07:26| or you were aware that we were allocating money for weatherization of homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=446)|
| 0:07:33| And a lot of times we do make these kind of decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| but we never hear what happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| and we don't put a face to some of the work that we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| So tonight I'm going to put a face to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| Jarius Bush, James Moses, and Lauren Bailey, if you could also come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| Jarius Bush and James Moses, through CAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| completed 570 audits for low-income homeowners from June 1st of 2009 through March 26th, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=478)|
| 0:08:07| This work, as I said, is the work of Knox County CAC weatherization program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| It's been a tough assignment, crawling in basements, attics, underneath homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| getting dirt all over you everywhere, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| which apparently inspired them to go back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| James plans to go to UT for environmental science after this experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| and wants to pursue a career in green technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| and Jarius, who's actually somebody that I've worked with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| is continuing his graphic design coursework at Pellissippi this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| Jarius will serve a second term of AmeriCorps with CAC starting in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| And then Lauren Bailey, right behind there, push those guys aside, come on, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| has been serving with Beardsley Community Farm since June 1st, 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| and has coordinated 702 volunteers who gave over 2,000 hours at Beardsley this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=536)|
| 0:09:02| Is that true? That's a lot of, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| She has coordinated emergency food, helpers fundraising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| and educational events like Hunger Hike and Filling Empty Bags,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| which raised over $50,000 for 35 food pantries in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| Lauren is a graduate of Carson Newman College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| and will attend Vanderbilt University for graduate school later this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| So here's an example of three young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| who actually did some really significant work in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| And before John says something, I'd like to clap for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| All right, John Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=573)|
| 0:09:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| Last May, CAC AmeriCorps was awarded the funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=585)|
| 0:09:53| We got some additional funding to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| And Lauren, Jarius, and James were able to serve as AmeriCorps members this past year due to that additional funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| And when I recruited these members, I think of a phrase from Dr. King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| which is everyone can be great because everybody can serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| You don't need a college degree to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| You don't need to know about Plato and Aristotle to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| You don't need to know Einstein's theory of relativity to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| You just need a heart full of grace, a soul generated by love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| And whenever I'm trying to recruit members like Jarius and James and Lauren,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| that's one of the things I think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| I think about do they want to serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| Do they put the needs of others before their own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| Do they have a servant's heart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| And that's one of the things that's important for my program and for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| is there are people like this that have, you know, great skills, great credentials, enormous talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=644)|
| 0:10:55| But they serve with our program instead of going and getting a job and doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=655)|
| 0:11:02| I just want to congratulate and commend them for the service that they've done and finishing this service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| Their service is going to end this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| For 16 years, CAC AmeriCorps' mission has been to get things done, and they have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| Like Chris said, Lauren's, she's mobilized, trained, and organized over 700 volunteers at Beardsley Farm this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=676)|
| 0:11:24| She coordinated CAC's emergency food helpers, which is kind of a job that I, you know, passed off on her and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=684)|
| 0:11:31| hey, let's go and do that, and she did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| I mean, she did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| She organized hunger hikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| She organized filling empty bags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| She did the FEMA food distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| And like Chris said, $50,000 of food went to local food pantries because of her work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| And since June of last year, Jarius and James both conducted 570 home audits, home energy audits, with the weatherization program at CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=708)|
| 0:11:59| And they used these as a baseline to be able to figure out how they were going to install insulation, caulking, energy-saving techniques.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=719)|
| 0:12:08| Jarius and James not only helped low-income homeowners to save money on their energy costs in their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| but they also helped clients to understand the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| They listened to their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| That's an important part of what the AmeriCorps members did this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| These two guys did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| They not only went into 570 homes and did energy audits, but they listened to clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| They were the face of CAC's weatherization program, and they did a great job in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| And I just want to congratulate them on the service that they did this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| This is something that is really unusual for my program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| I've never in eight years come before city council and said anything about the AmeriCorps members and what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| I feel really terrible about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| But these guys have done such great work, and I wanted to be able to let you know that this kind of work is being done in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=767)|
| 0:12:56| and it's due in part to the vote that you made to give weatherization to CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| And you're a great leader of this work, so I want to thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| Real quickly, let me ask Jarius, let me ask you a question, a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| The homes, the people that you worked with, did they seem to appreciate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| Yes, they did appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| I mean, at first they probably weren't quite sure that weatherization was all that important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| and then part of your task was to convince them that it was, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| We basically walked them through the process of what we were doing when we went to their clients' houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| because they were like, what's a blower door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| I'm like, what's this technology you're using right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| But they pretty much understood what we were doing, and they were grateful for what we'd done after work was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| Well, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Take care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Thanks, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=827)|
| 0:13:54| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| I want to go over a couple of workshops that are coming up for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| First, this coming Thursday, there is a workshop on the five-year consolidated plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| which everybody got a copy of tonight, which actually kind of looks like just a big document with a lot of words in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=845)|
| 0:14:12| It is actually a really important piece of our plan for community development for the next five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=852)|
| 0:14:20| a workshop this Thursday at 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| There is also, and Ms. Rojera, correct me if I'm wrong, a public hearing on this next Tuesday, the 13th, at 5.30 at the Canceler Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=862)|
| 0:14:33| People are also invited to go online and make comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| You can actually, right on the city's home page, is a notice about city requests, public input on community development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=876)|
| 0:14:44| five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| You can get the plan through that link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| You can make comments through that, and we really do encourage folks to take a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| and let us know what they think on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| This is a big deal for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| That workshop is coming up this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| Next Thursday, April 15th, city council is having a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| I think what we're going to be doing is just sort of a presentation on the city pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| which is important to a lot of our employees, a big value in some of the benefits we give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| And I also wanted to say that, well, at our last meeting, we talked about doing a workshop on April 29th on the East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=915)|
| 0:15:24| We probably will be doing a workshop, but later, at some discussion at dinner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| we talked about the questions that council members have on that are big-picture questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| How does the development work there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| How does economic development happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| How does some of the zoning options for Asheville Highway, how do they work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| And we're going to wait and sort of get away from the controversy of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| and then talk a little more about those big-picture questions down the road a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| and I will have a date hopefully here in another week or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| Seeing no others, we will move along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| 8A is a resolution appointing Rose Turner to serve the remainder of an unexpired term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| as a member of the Citizens Advisory Committee to the Knoxville Area Transit Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| 9A is an ordinance approving the request of the City of Knoxville for an amendment to the Northeast County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| from neighborhood commercial to general commercial for the eastern pieces of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| and general commercial for parcel 92.01 of the northern pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| Said property located on the north, south, and west sides of Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| north side of McCampbell Drive, southwest and southeast of Murphy Road, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| We have two folks signed up to speak in favor, and by rules they'll go first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| and then one that I show signed up to speak against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| and so we'll go those in favor first in order they signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| Wayne Klein would be first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| Mr. Mayor, could you have her read 12A as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| We'll read 12A so the discussion is pertinent to both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| 12A is an ordinance approving the request of the City of Knoxville for an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| to the Northeast County Sector Plan from neighborhood commercial to general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| for property located on the southeast side of Washington Pike, southeast of Murphy Road, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1030)|
| 0:17:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Mr. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| I'm Wayne Klein, 617 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| I'll defer my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| I don't think I need to speak, but I'm here on behalf of the National Bank of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| and you already voted, and I thank you, but if I need to speak, I wanted to sign it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1060)|
| 0:17:47| Mr. Mayor, I think, you know, lawyers don't like to yield any point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| or yield when they get an opportunity to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| but I think it might be appropriate to have Mr. Donaldson sort of outline what these plan amendments are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1077)|
| 0:18:07| and related to which properties before I would engage in comments, if that is your pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1087)|
| 0:18:16| Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| Yes, sir, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| This plan amendment stems back to city council's request to consider planned commercial zoning for this set of parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1100)|
| 0:18:30| and in order to do that, the sector plan had to be amended to general commercial in order to consider planned commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1110)|
| 0:18:41| At your March 9th meeting, you adopted the plan amendment but failed to take action on any change of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1121)|
| 0:18:51| The effect of this would be to change from neighborhood commercial to general commercial for four properties located in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1131)|
| 0:19:05| eastern cluster of properties at Murphy Road and Washington Avenue and a single property in that northern cluster of properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1145)|
| 0:19:14| along Campbell Drive and Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| Three of those four properties already are classified as general commercial on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1158)|
| 0:19:29| Your action tonight is to vote up or down on the amendment that was adopted by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1169)|
| 0:19:37| Approving this amendment will have the effect of bringing into conformity the sector plan, the one-year plan, and the zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1177)|
| 0:19:48| If you fail to approve it, the only impact would be in the event that someone tries to rezone these properties in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1188)|
| 0:19:58| they would be limited to those zones that are allowed within the neighborhood commercial land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1198)|
| 0:20:05| So it won't affect the existing zoning on the property at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1205)|
| 0:20:13| Okay. Mr. King, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| I'll try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| As indicated, when there was consideration of perhaps placing a planned zoning classification on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1222)|
| 0:20:35| an amendment to the sector plan was required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| That hasn't occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| The properties remain zoned as they were prior to the application for rezoning the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1243)|
| 0:20:53| But as noted by Mr. Donaldson, you've sort of got a little bit of a situation where the zoning classifications that are in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1253)|
| 0:21:07| and are to remain in place are somewhat inconsistent with the plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| And if you amend the sector plan, you have the sector plan, the one-year plan, then in conformity with each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| and likewise in conformity with the existing zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| And that is what is being proposed by these plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1283)|
| 0:21:30| Additionally, if you looked at this chart, which you all have seen before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| but these three properties right here are already in the sector plan designated as general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1296)|
| 0:21:45| One of the properties being proposed or one of the properties now involved in the plan amendment to go to general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1305)|
| 0:21:55| is this piece which adjoins those three pieces immediately to the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| which are already in the plan as general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| It just puts this one in and makes it general commercial also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| The other piece over here is this piece, which again, putting it as general commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1328)|
| 0:22:18| puts it into conformity with the one-year plan and the zoning that exists on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| The same is true with this shaded green part, which is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| We support the requested plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| As I say, it puts everything somewhat more consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| That is the plan and the actual zoning on the property and as related to the other adjoining properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1357)|
| 0:22:45| We support the request for the first item is on a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1365)|
| 0:22:54| The item that is under 12i, I believe, is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| You may recall that that is coming along later and now on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| because at the time MPC acted on these plan amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| they inadvertently left out that one piece that now is actually this area that's shaded in green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1388)|
| 0:23:17| That's the reason it's on for a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| We would ask your support. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| Okay. Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| And councilmen and women, Mr. Mayor, thank you for your time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| I'm speaking in opposition to items 9a and 12i.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| These sector plan amendments, they were part of a sector plan and a rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| They were procedurally required for that zoning request to pass through MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| And it's actually important to note that it was a single vote, I believe, at MPC to pass both the sector plan and the zone request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| So they didn't consider them separately, nor did they discuss them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| The zoning that's on the parcels does govern what the use is of the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| It, I believe, is what impacts the appraisal value of the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| So that existing zoning has been retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| And, therefore, I would argue that since there hasn't been a change to the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| that the sector plan amendments are not required and should be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| There are some other reasons to deny the sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| Today the existing sector plan, as Mr. Donson said, is neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| That's been established on the eastern parcels for some sector plan amendments that were passed in 2003 and 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1468)|
| 0:24:36| It's interesting to note in the case history that in both instances the requester asked for what was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| and these were in the county at the time, it was a commercial sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| And in both cases the staff and the MPC tempered that request and passed what would be a neighborhood commercial designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| So there's precedent for considering commercial in the area in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| and denying it and tempering that to neighborhood commercial planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| The northern parcel has designated neighborhood commercial as part of the north city sector planning process that occurred in summer of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1499)|
| 0:25:08| That parcel had an underlying zoning of CA in the county, which is their general commercial zoning area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1508)|
| 0:25:15| But as part of the sector planning process, staff and the residents and everybody involved in that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| we think that should be a neighborhood commercial designation on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| So there's precedent to say that that sector plan overlaying it was inconsistent with the underlying zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| And it passed and everybody's been living with it since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| The second point is that the planning staff, when they considered the rezoning request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| their recommendation was for neighborhood commercial for the entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| So planning staff, in their professional opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| has said that they really think this area should be neighborhood commercial labeled on the sector plan map, not general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| That's also reflected in the staff reports and minutes for a number of rezoning sector plan amendments that have happened on these parcels over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1551)|
| 0:26:02| Third, there is a precedent of having a sector plan of NC with an underlying zoning that's higher but conditioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1562)|
| 0:26:09| That's what we see on the eastern parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| It occurred for the southern two-thirds of those parcels, action 7-alpha-07-Sierra Papa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| There's a plan amendment that was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| Again, this was the request to request a general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| But the planning commission and then county commission approved neighborhood commercial for the sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1585)|
| 0:26:33| The underlying zoning was county CA, which is their general commercial equivalent to C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| But it was conditioned to NC uses plus self-storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| So there's precedent in the past to actually have a disconnect between the sector plan and the underlying zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| And finally, I have to say that if this passes, the question is that it might be the intent to bring it into conformity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1608)|
| 0:26:56| but does that open up for unintended consequences in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| General commercial plan designation allows for more intensive types of development zoning on those parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1621)|
| 0:27:10| It actually suggests in the land use classifications commercial 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| It allows C3, C4, C5, SC1, and planned commercial 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| It's possible as a potential consequence somebody looking to buy these from some of the banks that own them could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| oh, this is a general commercial or has general commercial sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| I'm going to buy it and then request upzoning to increase my value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| That sets an expectation in their head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| And they'll come to you with the argument that it has general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| The land use classifications say we should be able to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| Nowhere in the prior history has any intent been said by any of the owners or especially by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1662)|
| 0:27:51| to make this a general commercial type of development out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| And so if you deny this or take no action, the existing sector plan is retained at neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1675)|
| 0:28:02| It's been at that designation on these parcels since the summer of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| It's the decision that everybody's made financial and investment decisions on, so nothing changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| And thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| Questions from members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Mr. Delaboffe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| Mr. Murphy, can you tell us about your personal involvement in that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| and where you live and the circumstances of your community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| I live on an old family farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| It has probably at least about 1,000, well, maybe 800 linear feet adjacent to these affected parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1711)|
| 0:28:40| And my cousins own additional parcels that have another few thousand feet of adjacent property line to the affected parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1720)|
| 0:28:48| And I've taken some steps to try and restore an old farmhouse there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| and I'm working with the county historical zoning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| to actually put a historic zoning overlay on my 50 acres of parcel there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| And as part of that, I actually intend to ask for a sector plan amendment to go from low density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| which is on mine right now, to agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| And I've actually showed in a map that I sent in a letter to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| it illustrates what this would look like in the sector plan if you passed general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| and then you have what goes to agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| It's a very sharp, sensitive boundary there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| And so my concern for a number of months out here has been the impact of that on my property, on my cousin's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1762)|
| 0:29:33| And the community has stated a number of times that they are concerned about the impacts on their houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| They're concerned it's all residential that surrounds this or agricultural, and they're concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| So that's sort of what my involvement is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| And if I could ask a follow-up question to Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| The speaker indicated to us that at least the MPC staff had been looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| and using neighborhood commercial for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| The current land use classification in the sector plan for these four properties, five with 9205 coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1802)|
| 0:30:11| is neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| In our recommendations regarding the rezoning of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| we recommended to keep it neighborhood commercial and adopt a zoning classification SC1 that was consistent with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1817)|
| 0:30:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| And the road that goes through Washington Pike and Murphy Road, those are both two-lane roads at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| They have not been widened or made into major arteries at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| Other questions or comments from members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| Right now there's not a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| I move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| There's a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| I heard a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| Mr. Donaldson, to make sure that I understand the progression of all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| City Council, I guess we were the body that asked MPC to consider planned commercial zoning for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1868)|
| 0:31:17| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| And so you beautifully looked at that, brought it back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| but let us know that to enact the planned commercial zone, we had to change the sector plan to general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1884)|
| 0:31:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| And as this worked its way through, the planned commercial was never approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1896)|
| 0:31:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| So now we're at a juncture with a request for a change in the sector plan that was initiated by the planned commercial that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1905)|
| 0:31:57| admittedly, we asked for but that never passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| So I guess my question is, is the sector plan amendment required in this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1920)|
| 0:32:07| It is not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| It will have no impact on the current zoning of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| Its only impact would be on any future rezoning requests that might come along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| And so I know the last time we discussed this, four weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| we realized that through some changes in ownership, there are a number of different landholders who have interest in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1944)|
| 0:32:31| but all of their development use by right does not change based on our action on this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1951)|
| 0:32:40| because the underlying zoning is remaining the same as it was when all of those properties were changing hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1960)|
| 0:32:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| C3C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Which is the C3C4, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| So I plan to not support this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| Yeah, I think I agree with you, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| I'm not going to be supporting this either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| We did have a long discussion at this at our, I guess, four weeks ago now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| This is, I think, an area that deserves good protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| I was supporting the planned commercial that did not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| I think this gives us a really good way to limit long-term what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=1996)|
| 0:33:23| There's nothing that says we can't change it down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| There's nothing that says we can't react to situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| But I think right now this puts a little more limit on the kind of development that we don't necessarily want there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2009)|
| 0:33:37| So I will not be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| I'd like to acknowledge Mr. King to see if he had a response to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| Mayor, members of council, and I didn't introduce myself a while ago and I apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| I think the interest of the parties who currently own property there is, if you will, the elimination of potential uncertainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2040)|
| 0:34:11| Any time you have an inconsistency between, you know, one plan as opposed to another plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2051)|
| 0:34:20| or a plan as opposed to a zoning classification, there is some uncertainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| And I think that is a good reason to have all of this coincide, if you will, one with the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2066)|
| 0:34:34| As far as the concern about the type of development that's there is with the current zoning classification that's in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2074)|
| 0:34:43| for example, on the side of Washington Pike that's where the Weigel store is, the rezoning there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2083)|
| 0:34:52| there's a zoning classification in place, but it is limited and or restricted in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2092)|
| 0:34:59| You know, the development that can be done on these properties as currently zoned is pretty much a known factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2099)|
| 0:35:11| There's nothing about, if you will, denying the plan amendment that achieves anything about what goes on those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2111)|
| 0:35:20| that are there right now, zoned as they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| And I would suggest that, you know, you're looking at a quantified area, a very well-defined described area and parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2124)|
| 0:35:35| and putting all of these things in place that are consistent one with the other is the kind of thing that ought to take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2135)|
| 0:35:43| as a part of, if you will, that overall planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2143)|
| 0:35:51| If there is fear about what may happen in the future on some other property, that's a totally different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2151)|
| 0:36:02| And if there's some other property that becomes a question or becomes an issue before any zoning takes place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2162)|
| 0:36:12| or any plan amendments take place on any other property other than these, it's going to have to come back before this body to be accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2172)|
| 0:36:21| I think that the points made are made more toward that kind of thing than what we have before us here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| Again, I would urge you to support these two plan amendments, and one of them is, as I say, this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2187)|
| 0:36:38| the first one is the 9A is here on second reading, the other one is here on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| Councilman Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| I just wanted to clarify that the motion only pertains to 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| That's all that's in front of us on this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| I just wanted to double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| I think I understand this, but I wanted to ask Mr. Donaldson, if I may, Mr. Mayor, that we just heard some discussion about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2216)|
| 0:37:05| future effects and uses of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| As I understood how this council got here, we were trying to deal with that by suggesting some form of planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2228)|
| 0:37:16| That ultimately didn't take root, and so we find ourselves here with those old zones in place and the property owners have the benefit of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2236)|
| 0:37:24| That's correct, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| And if someone wants to change it, they can have both the sector plan and the zone change at that time when full consideration of the pros| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2247)|
| 0:37:35| and cons can be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| Is that a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| So leaving it as is, as neighborhood commercial, leaves that open, that issue open for the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| but it doesn't pre-permit someone from going forward with their current zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| We're going to vote on 9A alone, and then after that we'll go ahead and vote on 12I at this point in time, just so everybody's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2275)|
| 0:38:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| All those in favor of 9A, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2283)|

| 0:38:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| We better do a voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| I mean a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2290)|

| 0:38:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| I heard three ayes and five noes, so the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2311)|

| 0:38:33| Excuse me, three and six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| May I ask about it tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| Three ayes and six noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| We don't have a motion on 12I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| There's not a motion on 12I on the floor at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| Does anyone want to make a motion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2325)|
| 0:38:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| Seeing no motion, we will move on unless someone wants to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2337)|

| 0:39:36| Excuse me, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| Mr. Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| Yes, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| I wasn't here when we acted on it in the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| Well, we have, I wanted to ask one of the representatives, I'm not sure who's here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| on this one, maybe it's Mr. King, but will we have some form of public education for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2386)|
| 0:39:53| contractors and others who might want to get up to speed and make sure they're following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| the newest code, which obviously is the one that has the most protective provisions for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| Ernie Broome, Chief Electrical Inspector, City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| We have classes usually once or twice every two or three months in regards to our new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2408)|
| 0:40:16| code requirements, and we've had some excellent attendance at those code classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| So we're helping the contractors be up to speed and do it the right way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| 11A is a resolution approving the issuance of a Certificate of Compliance to Rahab, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2433)|

| 0:40:42| Commission for a license to operate a liquor store in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| 11B is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an amendment to the operating contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2453)|

| 0:41:05| Avenue parking lot located at 401 West Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Mr. Delibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| I guess Mr. Lyons is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| Maybe he could address this, but as I understand it, we will have this lot and use it both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2477)|
| 0:41:24| for its rental use for neighbors or others who are visiting the site as well as for construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2484)|
| 0:41:32| staging as activity starts to happen on the Jackson Avenue projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| So we won't have to go out and buy or condemn land to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| We'll be in a position at this point to actually get the construction done and have an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| to put materials and whatnot and equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| And that is one of the reasons we were very anxious to get control of that lot because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| of the impending construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| But also we want to take advantage of obviously parking for either residents or for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| visiting businesses during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| And I understand that you have what, about a million three invested in this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| Do you hope to amortize some or all of that through your rental program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| The intent of this isn't that the lot will basically be amortized, but that we will receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2534)|
| 0:42:22| some cash flow from it that will go into the general parking fund that will help overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| with parking concerns, but that it provides a very valuable public purpose in supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| all those who are affected by the work on the 100 block, those who will live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| the businesses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| And also we do think that it's appropriate to charge for many of those who will be using it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| as they move into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| And that's why we want to have a component that has to do with helping pay into the parking fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2563)|
| 0:42:51| But the intent originally of this never really was as a business model to look at amortizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| the purchase price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| It was that this was essential for the long-term development of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| But we will have it open for facilitating use of the old city as well in the evenings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| and weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| We'll have it for the old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| We want to keep with what we think is a very successful nights and weekends program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| We also another very important entity there is the Emporium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| And it's being used right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| We want to continue to let folks use the Emporium for all of their events, their meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| First Fridays, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| They're already using it right now in its present state, but we want to preserve that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| I'd like to thank Dr. Lyons and Ms. Parker for taking a second look at this and doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| some due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| And I understand that if 50 percent of the lot is leased to monthly parkers that we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| be able to cover our monthly operating costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| My question relates to the amount of space that we would need for the construction staging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| If we want to have spaces open for the public for nights and weekends or for temporary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| daytime parking, and we're anticipating leasing half the spaces to monthly parkers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| and then there's also construction staging, how does all that work out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| How much space does the construction need, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| Well, we're not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| The ramp construction will take some, and the staging will take some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| It certainly should not take all of the remaining spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| It's quite a large lot, and some of it can be down a little bit further from Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| but we can work out the direct location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| We should always have a reasonable amount of spaces for daily use as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| without even committing to the spaces we'd be leasing monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| And I guess we'll have to get closer to the ramp construction to know for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| but comparable projects haven't taken anything near the space that would be, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| associated with a quarter of the lot, so I think we should be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2685)|

| 0:46:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| Mr. Delamope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| Yes, Mr. King, would you help us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| I understand, I think, from this that when we acted maybe four weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2821)|
| 0:47:08| on increasing the capital budget for that 100 block of Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| we were taking into account that we had cost adds and overruns on the overall project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| over a period of time and that this $200,000 is part of the monies we were, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| appropriating to cover the cost of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| So we're not coming up with yet another amendment and adding more cost to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| We're simply carrying out some of the things that we've been dealing with over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| One of them was those piers that didn't have foundations in an appropriate situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| And now we're finishing the sidewalk in time to get our businesses back and operating by mid-August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| Mr. Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| Mr. Delamope, he served me well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| I'm glad he's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| You were having to double for him last time, as I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| We're twins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| He's just a little taller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2890)|

| 0:48:12| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| But before Cindy starts this, 11H, I, and J are all dealing with the same topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| I'm going to ask Ms. Mitchell to read all three of those and then we'll discuss those together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| And then, you know, if we need to vote on them separately, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| But at least for the discussion, we'll do them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2905)|

| 0:49:35| Thanks, Deb. Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| I was wondering if I could ask Ms. Poplin a question before we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| Right when we sat down, we were provided with some black line copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| And thank you for noting which pages are changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| Could you let us know if any of those are substantial and sort of what those are before we launch into our discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| since we just got those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| I'd be happy to go over those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| They're not substantial changes, but they were clarifications that we had made since Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| Do you want me to go through those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| Just quickly, yeah, what's in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| The first one that we have on 11H, get to the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3008)|
| 0:50:18| If you will look on page 6, there was just a topographical error in the contract price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3018)|
| 0:50:25| and so that was just a clarification for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| On 11I, there was a change on page 2 to recite the funding as CDBG instead of NSP funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3028)|
| 0:50:40| And then the last one, 11J on the home agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| there was some language added on page 3 in the middle of that page to recite that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3045)|
| 0:50:52| Flinicken Housing had applied for and been awarded an allocation of low-income housing credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3052)|
| 0:50:59| And there was clarification on page 5 as to how the high home rents would be calculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3059)|
| 0:51:10| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| Before we get started, several folks in council had said kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| can you give us some background kind of to how we got here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| I guess it's about five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| I guess some community members got together to say that the status quo way that we're dealing with homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| is not a good approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| We're pouring increasing community resources into the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| and we seem to be adding to it rather than taking away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| And the approach of basically using the various missions to provide meals and housing overnight during bad weather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3094)|
| 0:51:42| really didn't seem to be addressing the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| It didn't feel like we were doing that from a compassionate standpoint as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| We weren't really striving for any real change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| And it didn't feel like it was an efficient way to do it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| As we tracked, we looked at getting more and more resources, whether it was going through the various missions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| whether it was going to the jail, whether it was going to Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| whether it was going to UT Emergency Room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| We were increasing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| And Dr. Roger Noe of UT did a study that I think all of you have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| where he basically, I think, tracked 20 homeless folks to see, well, what are they costing the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| And the number came out to be I think either $37,000 or $38,000 per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| that somewhere in the community we were spending on folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| And I think the consensus became we're not making a difference, so we're not being compassionate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| and we're not being very efficient in how we're addressing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| There has to be a different approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| And so we start, that community group started looking around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| and basically settled on the idea of permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| About that time I went to several meetings of mayors from around the country who were doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| It was actually a program first initiated by the Bush Administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| later picked up by the Obama Administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| one of the few programs that kind of made the jump, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| But cities, some far ahead of us, some doing about what we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| some behind us began to pick up on the idea of permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| as the most effective way to deal with the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| So that's really how the program started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| This specific program, I know there's been, this specific project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| there's been some questions about the finances of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| And I think some people asked Bill Lyons if he would present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| before we got started, kind of how the economics of this work, who pays what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| what the city is responsible for or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| So Bill, I'll do that and then we'll take, we do have people signed up from the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| to speak for and against and we will go to that next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| And I guess right on time we've gotten our PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| And the reason we're using this, which I know we don't usually use at council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| I think it's very helpful to use this so the audience can have access to what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| because we'll be addressing this to council and who has a copy of this summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| I think we, I want to add, we are preparing this financial pro forma in three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| and presenting it in four phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| The development of the structure, so this is basically a housing structure at first, at first instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3227)|
| 0:53:54| Then, and we're going to get into what that budget is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| Many people have raised, I was, along with many other folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| we're at a meeting at the Jewish Community Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| Folks are here, Mr. Peabody and others presented a pro forma on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| and asked a lot of questions that I think deserved answers and we're providing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| And we're here to try to present these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| We're presenting them in terms of what that budget is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| Then we're going to get after we talk about conceptual, the conceptual look at the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| at the operation of the structure as a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| Primarily this is a residence first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| So we'll talk about how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| And what we'll come up with there is that building and operating the structure first as a residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3269)|
| 0:54:35| is not that out of the ordinary at all from a very well developed approach to low income housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3275)|
| 0:54:43| that cash flows, that has a private developer making use of low income tax credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3283)|
| 0:54:49| and other funding sources that vary from project to project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| But basically the funding source is the vouchers or other means of paying the rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| that folks bring to the residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| What really makes the permanent supportive housing piece and the Flanagan piece different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| is that we're adding a layer of supportive services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| And that's where a lot of questions have come up as to the funding source for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| So I thought rather than talk in just one global sense about what the costs are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| where the money comes from, where it goes, let's break it down into structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| how it's developed, residence, and then supportive services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| So if council would turn to page two on the development of the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| you'll see that there's an overall cost of a little over $7 million for 48 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3329)|
| 0:55:36| And we'll get into the next page a little bit about the per unit cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| the per square foot cost, and why it is the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| The funding sources for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| We've got private investor equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| There's a mortgage of a little over $300,000 that you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| Affordable housing program grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| Federal home bank board sounds ominously like the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| It's actually private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| It's a private entity that provides a grant for these purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| And low income housing tax credits, which are also private investment funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| So that is the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| We have investors in this project, private investors in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| This is not a government run project or a government built project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| This is one that we are playing a role in assisting to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| would be the way that I would look at the government role here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| We also have federal funds appropriated for this purpose allocated to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| And that is, yes, federal funds are important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| and we're all interested that they be spent wisely, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| These have already been allocated, and we have applied for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| or the project managers have applied for and gotten a tax credits assistance program loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| of a million and a half dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| Then we have three other items, and those are the ones that are actually before council tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| Those are federal funds appropriated and allocated, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| for this purpose or like purposes of which this is a subset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| Neighborhood stabilization program funds, the 800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| NSP, you've heard that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| Council has considered the over global allocation of these before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| Community development block grant funds of 100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| which you'll be considering as part of your joint items that you've bundled together here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| And home funds of a quarter of a million dollars, $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| I want to stress that in the building of this structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| no city or county local taxpayer funds are included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| Nothing from the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| This structure, again, is a mix of private equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| federal funds allocated by the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| federal funds that come and are appropriated and allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| through a process that you'll be approving tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| Okay, if we can go to the next slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| we'll get to a lot of questions that were asked that obviously deserve answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| And that is, well, where is this money going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| Why is this costing what it costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| And we'll go over these quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| Acquisition of the site, $235,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| Demolition site work, rehab of the site, almost $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| A contingency, and we're going to have David Arning here to answer lots of questions about what these mean in detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| but a hard cost contingency of $367,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| Obviously, it's hard to estimate exactly what costs will be on everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| and you have to leave some contingencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| Architecture and engineering, $180,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| LEED consulting certification, $28,800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| That allows us to point out something I think that is important to the quality of this building that will be in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| This is a LEED certified sustainable building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| which will have low operating costs for utilities for residents now and residents in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| And this is part and parcel of the kind of structure we want to make that is sustainable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3520)|
| 0:58:47| and LEED is all about sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| Part that's in here that's not part of your usual pro forma for building, as you know, a real estate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3529)|
| 0:58:55| any usual real estate entity is apartment and office furnishings of $164,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| That is, this is going to be built and furnished as part of the development cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| And then other soft costs and contingency costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| Construction interests, property taxes, insurance paid on the front end, operating reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| I want to talk about that a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| As part of the cost here, the developer has to maintain over a $200,000 operating reserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3556)|
| 0:59:22| which means if folks don't get into this building as much quickly as we would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| if vouchers, which we'll hear about, are not available as quickly as we would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| that the building still has to be paid for, and that is front-ended for an entire year's worth by this line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3570)|
| 0:59:38| The developer fee, this is to the non-profit Southeast Housing, $864,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3578)|
| 0:59:44| Obviously, you will have questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| The quick version, and we'll be able to discuss this further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| is that the investors in the low-income tax credits have to have some assurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| that this building will operate for a number of years for the purposes that it was designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| And if it doesn't, the entity that's liable for, that has to make up the difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| is the non-profit entity, is Southeastern Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| So the low-income tax credit folks and the people at the state have recommended a 15% developer fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3613)|
| 1:00:21| to help ensure that this happens and provide the backup to the sustainability of this housing unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3621)|
| 1:00:29| Again, this is not to any individual, it's not to a for-profit, it's to the non-profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| and it also helps them work toward their capitalization of other projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| if they can get through this one without having to dip too deeply into that developer fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| So the total construction cost for 36,000 square feet is, again, $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3644)|
| 1:00:50| If you take away the furnishings and operating reserve, which are not typically in a real estate transaction such as this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3650)|
| 1:00:57| it's $6.6 million, which is a per square cost minus the furnishings and operating of $185.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3657)|
| 1:01:06| That is within line of comparable projects, 48-unit efficiency like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| Looking at projects like this in other cities, it's comparable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| It is a little less than the Eastport School elderly housing that council had approved earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| So while it is expensive, undeniably expensive, projects like this are expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| you're providing the overhead of all the bathrooms and kitchen materials and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3686)|
| 1:01:32| for people in a limited number of square feet, and lots of those which are very expensive fill up that structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| So that's the development budget, and again, we'll obviously be open to answer questions about all of this as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| I will add one more, the asterisk at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| All of this is publicly bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| Every bit of this will be let out to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| Okay, if we could go to slide four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| Now that the building, you've got the pro form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| Bill, could we just go back one second on the developer fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| So if it is successful, then what happens to this fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3720)|
| 1:02:07| If it's successful and everybody gets in there and it doesn't need to be drawn at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| then it becomes part of the non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| We'll have that to use for developing and servicing other like projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| which are low income housing projects and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| And it's designated only for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| And I will have, we can discuss that further when John Lawler and others can get to specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| But basically it is not, it goes for the purpose of maintaining the non-profit for its established function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3750)|
| 1:02:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| Now that is so funding again, that gets us through building the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| and how the dollars are allocated to get the structure built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| The next is operating the structure as a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| Now basically this is, there's not too much to this that gets into many more dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| because the pro forma of this entire model is that low income housing once built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3779)|
| 1:03:10| cash flow based on the rents that people pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| Frankly, just like any other kind of rental does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| You assume the rents pay and sustain the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| This, in this case, this includes 24-7 staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| We discussed when we met with the community and others that this building be secured 24 hours a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3802)|
| 1:03:28| seven days a week, not left open in the manner that the average apartment would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3808)|
| 1:03:34| And that includes general property management as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| We stress here again, the city has no financial exposure in regards to either building the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| no financial exposure in regards to operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| This is all falls and becomes the obligation and the responsibility of southeastern housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3825)|
| 1:03:53| And again, the sources of this, residents come with vouchers, we'll be able to discuss that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| Other income sources, SSI, SSDI, veterans benefits sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| sometimes families who are responsible for folks who have been able to take care of themselves in the normal way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3843)|
| 1:04:12| and would be helped by living here, step up and pay this rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| So the income stream just for the residential portion is paid for by the rental fees that folks pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3855)|
| 1:04:23| Again, to round off this, no city and county local taxpayer funds go into the operation of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3863)|
| 1:04:31| just as no city and county local taxpayer funds have gone into the building of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| Okay, the last page is the operating structure for supportive services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| This is what's different from a usual low income housing project of which we have many that operate around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3881)|
| 1:04:49| In this case, we will have two caseworkers, that's at the one for 24 ratio obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3889)|
| 1:04:57| and we've included $110,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| This includes all their benefits and also some incidental expenses that they would be expected to bear in performing this function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3900)|
| 1:05:08| Pizza parties for folks and there would be a lot of group activities, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| that the caseworkers would be expected to facilitate out of these fundings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3912)|
| 1:05:18| The resident's medical needs are funded by Medicaid and TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| The caseworker, anybody in here will be eligible for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| The caseworker will make sure that they are signed up to get the medical care that they are owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3926)|
| 1:05:32| There are other food, clothing, and other things that came up at the public discussion we had a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3932)|
| 1:05:38| These are funded by either the resident's employment, many of these folks work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| or other programs, again, SSI, disability, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| that provide sources of income for people without income who obtain food and clothing and other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| It's no different here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| So what we have here is predominantly private fundraising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| and I want to speak to what the 10-year plan has done here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| and I think they deserve a tremendous amount of credit, John Lawler and his folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| What we've got is VMC has taken on primary responsibility for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| while CARM has taken on primary responsibility for emergency shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| We have to keep everybody, it's always important that we continue to remind ourselves that housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| and emergency shelter are very, very different ends and different functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| This is where people live, emergency shelters are where people go and stay for a night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| and come back out when they need to be served in, by definition, an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| VMC will focus their attention on their fundraising activities to raise money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=3995)|
| 1:06:43| and they've been successful for decades for this purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| rather than for other purposes that they've been using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| And they will be responsible, they will get private donations, United Way allocations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| have fundraisers, et cetera, to fund the caseworkers that will make up the 110,000 additional costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4017)|
| 1:07:04| associated with a project like this that's not associated with the usual low-income project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| that just has people living and not receiving supportive services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| I want to, so that basically gets us through the operating, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| and again, I think before we move on to the discussion, I'd like to add one more comment to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4041)|
| 1:07:29| And that is, we're going to hear a lot of very important discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| and discussion that is very appropriate about are we approaching this in the correct way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| Is the 10-year plan, Mayor Haslam alluded to the fact that the community did a lot of looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| at different ways to do this, and the housing first, the permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| is the predominant mode used in most cities, not all cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| and there is some disagreement in various literatures about whether this is the most viable way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4070)|
| 1:07:56| I think the preponderance of evidence is that it is, but we'll hear discussion upon that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| and reasonable people are going to disagree about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| We'll also hear about the funding pro forma that you have and whether that's appropriate or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| but it really does boil down to one final thing, and that is this project will provide opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| for 48 people to move on with their lives in a productive way that all evidence is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4091)|
| 1:08:17| without housing, they cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| And it will allow 48 people not to therefore suffer the fate that they would live in that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4099)|
| 1:08:27| but also put great costs on the community, and those costs are borne by local governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| they're borne by hospitals, they're borne by all of us in many ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| they come out of the local economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| But this is much more than a purely economic consideration, it's obviously a human consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| and this is the opportunity for 48 folks to get in a terrific place that all evidence shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4123)|
| 1:08:50| most of them will be able to succeed if they are able to have this chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| So what I'm going to do is stop at this point and I think turn it back over to Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| I know questions will come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| We have John Lawler from the 10-year plan, David Arning who's the developer who is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| Jenny Weatherstone with VMC who's going to be talking about supportive services will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| So we can get each question that we have and any of these to the appropriate person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| and I appreciate your allowing us the time to make this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| We have, I show on my sheet, two folks signed up to speak in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| We'll also go first, three folks signed up to speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| So we will start for those who signed up in favor, and the first is Stephanie Matheny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4166)|
| 1:09:33| If everybody would just give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| My name is Stephanie Matheny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| I live at 7717 Twining Drive in Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4179)|
| 1:09:46| I'm speaking in support of the Flennican proposal tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| I want to just say to the neighbors of that I also spoke in support of the Tberry proposal that was in my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4189)|
| 1:09:56| and I also had a letter to the editor published in support of the Dubusque Lane proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| I'm a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| I'm not given to emotional arguments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| but I think it's very important that we keep in mind the people who will be served by this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4206)|
| 1:10:15| I'm speaking not just as a resident of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| but as someone who developed housing for the homeless and other low-income people in Seattle and western Washington for 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4218)|
| 1:10:26| I want to say when we talked about starting permanent supportive housing under the Bush administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| I wasn't sure which Bush administration was meant because I started doing this in 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| I want to start by saying that I support this proposal for the very basic reason that the need is urgent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4236)|
| 1:10:47| I work downtown on the 100 block of Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| I see people every day who have no place to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| and I know that we have hundreds of people in Knoxville who have no place to live who are disabled and who are chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4258)|
| 1:11:07| We live in one of the wealthiest nations in the history of the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| and I personally believe that it is immoral for us not to provide for the most basic needs for our most vulnerable residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4271)|
| 1:11:19| I also believe that this is literally a question of life and death for some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4279)|
| 1:11:25| Life in a safe apartment with supportive services or an anonymous and cruel death on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4285)|
| 1:11:33| I know that there are people who live in the neighborhood of the Flennican| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| who have very legitimate concerns about the effect of this proposal on their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4297)|
| 1:11:45| All I can say to them is that over and over and over again, I have seen these programs succeed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4305)|
| 1:11:53| and I hope that if there's a positive vote tonight and the building moves forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| that some of these community members will also invest some of their energy in working constructively with a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4319)|
| 1:12:07| to see how they can help make a better proposal for their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| One of the specific buildings I worked on in Seattle is the Wintonia Apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4333)|
| 1:12:23| We started working on that, I think it was late in 1992.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4343)|
| 1:12:29| It is now permanent supportive housing. It's 91 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| Half of it is set aside for chronic public inebriates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4354)|
| 1:12:41| meaning people who are chronic alcoholics, the chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| The other half of the building is set aside for other homeless individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| frankly, whose needs are probably similar but they aren't necessarily disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| I went to many community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| About 30 more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| Well, then I will briefly wrap up to say that that particular building was a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| I emailed a link to a newspaper article that said that it was a success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| and that some of the people who opposed it, including a nearby school, are now supporters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| My overall point tonight is that it is important to talk about budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| but it's the humanity that is more important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| and I really hope that tomorrow morning when I have breakfast with my children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| I can point to the newspaper and say that Knoxville is a compassionate community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4411)|

| 1:13:40| Cheryl McCormick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| You can give us your name and address first, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| My name is Cheryl McCormick, and I live at 7208 Marywood Drive, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4428)|
| 1:13:55| I live in Rocky Hill, and I'm here to support the Flanagan Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| and the 10-year plan to end homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| I believe strongly that we need housing scattered across our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| east, west, north, and south, not just downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| I serve on the Board of Trustees for Lakeshore, the Knoxville Mayor's Council on Disability Issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| and co-chair the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Consumer Advisory Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4455)|
| 1:14:21| among other volunteer advocacy efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| My opinions are my own and not necessarily endorsed by any group with which I am affiliated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4464)|
| 1:14:30| I give you my credentials to emphasize the fact that people who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| or who have been homeless are not necessarily who you may think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| I'm a formerly homeless person who has a psychiatric illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| I work full-time for a local mental health agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| With proper mental health treatment and the support of others in my community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| I understand that society's low expectations of me as a person without a home didn't have to be my destiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4491)|
| 1:14:58| Being a quote unquote homeless person didn't have to be my identity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| My husband and I both lost our jobs due to our employer's poor management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| We lost our apartment, nearly all of our possessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| and even the car we lived in for a while with our two young daughters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| We didn't need to be herded up with others into a central location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| or we could be out of sight and out of mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| We would not have succeeded had we been relegated to a bad part of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| surrounded by too many temptations to resist when we felt hopeless and worthless anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| We wouldn't have cared, probably. Who else was caring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| If we'd been isolated from our natural community, segregated merely for being down on our luck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| our outcomes may have been very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| I didn't become homeless living in a bad part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| I would have been frightened, vulnerable, and unprepared to cope with an urban reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| especially because I was actively suicidal at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| desperate because I was about to be evicted, and scrambling to find alternative housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| Once homeless, we tried, in spite of many obstacles, to get back on our feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| Housing in the community was important to us and made a huge difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| Without decent, safe, and affordable stable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| it is very difficult to establish, much less maintain stability and even sanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4571)|
| 1:16:17| I learned that from my own experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| and that of those I served when I worked for Knox Area Rescue Ministry several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| My family and I benefited from having housing first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| Then we could work on rebuilding our lives instead of merely trying to survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| Today, I work across the state training others like myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| and people who work in the mental health and addiction treatment fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| how to teach my peers, with these very treatable brain illnesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| how to manage their symptoms and live productive lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| The success stories are amazing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| and they include people who were once homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| with both psychiatric illnesses and addictions, who are now in recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| Some of them are replicating what I do and changing lives for the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| Now we have opportunities to give back and contribute to the betterment of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| Having been homeless for any reason doesn't mean you can't make a positive difference in your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4625)|
| 1:17:13| I'm giving proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| Some of us have felt disposable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| We've certainly been treated that way, shunned, disempowered, and disrespected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| However, we are human beings who must be allowed the dignity and chance to live a meaningful life in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4642)|
| 1:17:29| not pushed away into an area that suits the comfort level of those blessed with stable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4649)|
| 1:17:35| From my own experience, I know that people who are homeless often feel unwanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| I wonder if you can imagine what that feels like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| People who have been homeless need you to embrace them and to hold the hope that they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| with your help and support, be respectable and respected members of society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| People often say, not in my backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| but many of us have come from neighborhoods just like yours, even your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| I grew up in West Knoxville in a nice suburban neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| and that's where I am back today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| I'm grateful for community support and most of all to my family for helping us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| but not everyone has family or friends that can come to your rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| Sometimes a larger community has a role to play to show the character of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4693)|
| 1:18:20| I wanted a hand up, not a handout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| just like the people who are homeless who would meet criteria for the Flanagan housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| That's what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| These are people who want a chance to regain self-respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| and become self-sufficient to the greatest degree possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| These are people who, like we were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| are willing to take personal responsibility to maintain housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| and who understand the need to be held accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| Financially, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| it will cost less to proceed with the Flanagan project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| and create that housing than it would to not carry on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| The human cost of not continuing on with the housing first model is incalculable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| The benefits may be blessings beyond all comprehension in our own backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| I'm asking you to support the Flanagan project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| and like projects in other areas of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| so that some folks who otherwise cost our city far more in services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| but who most of all need our compassion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| will be homeless no more. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| I have three folks signed up to speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| Debbie Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4766)|
| 1:19:39| And again, Debbie, if you'd start with your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| Debbie Taylor, 7732 Luxmore Drive, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| I came two weeks ago to try to talk to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| but I didn't realize that I had to sign up, so here I am again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| But tonight I wanted to tell you just how much it does trouble me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| that the money that I work so hard to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| will be used to pay for helping to enable drug addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4801)|
| 1:20:09| Our neighborhood has researched the ten-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| We have questioned them about what addiction treatment services will be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4812)|
| 1:20:18| They have no answer. They had no answer tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| They have no budget for what this is going to cost us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| And it seems to me that they just haven't figured out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| how to help these homeless addicts obtain sobriety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| and sobriety is not a condition of their lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| And if they have any hope of moving ahead in their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| and becoming a productive part of society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| sobriety is an absolute essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| The housing first plan allows them to continue to drink and do drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| as long as they aren't caught by the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| And I cannot condone that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| How did the previous council come to approve a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| that doesn't have sobriety as the primary goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| of helping the homeless addicts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| Putting these homeless addicts out of sight and out of mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| without helping them obtain sobriety is cruel and counterproductive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| And I don't want any part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| I oppose it. It opposes everything that I believe in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| And it does make me wonder, how did we get to this place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| of offering housing with no accountability and no responsibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4895)|
| 1:21:41| The plan has just been very upsetting to two neighborhoods already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| three neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| And at the Teeberry Lane, the homeless proposal would have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| the homeless people walking down Gleason Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| a very dangerous road to get to the bus, to get their food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| to get their medicines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| And I don't want my taxpayer dollars going to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| that is going to endanger these patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| And besides that, it is also a danger to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| that are driving on the roads, and that includes me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| it includes my family, my neighbors, my friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| And I know that this is a new council and not the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| that originally approved the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| but I want to know that you are representing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4946)|
| 1:22:32| I haven't talked with anyone who has any faith in this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| who knows the real details of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4956)|
| 1:22:42| How can we have faith in a plan that allows addicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4962)|
| 1:22:46| to continue in their addiction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| My request is that you do not continue to fund any more sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| under this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| Don't you think it would be wise to find a better plan to support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| A plan that has sobriety as a priority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| As the primary goal for helping homeless addicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| so that they can indeed move on to have productive lives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4990)|
| 1:23:16| The 10-year plan doesn't represent the best interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| of the homeless addict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| nor does it represent how the people want to show their compassion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| and help these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| I have come to you to tell you how I feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| and you will represent me by voting against any further funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| of the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| Thank you. Ron Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5022)|
| 1:23:53| I'd like for everybody to realize that we're not against helping the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| Ron, if you'll give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| I'm Ron Emory, 4014 Chapman Highway, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5039)|
| 1:24:06| We all have this perception of the homeless in which we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| they're alcoholics and won't work and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| When I was, what changed my opinion was in the 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5054)|
| 1:24:18| one January, flying me through Chicago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| that the homeless were living in the airport then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| It was late at night, I was walking through an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| and I was on the couches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| One fellow had no socks on, and this was in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| his ankles were this big from swelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| I've been told don't ever give them money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| because they were out to drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| and so I had to walk back, I had to catch my flight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| and I said I can't walk by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| I went back to give this man some money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| and he, coward, said go away, go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| And one of the reasons I'm against this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| it doesn't go far enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| Bill Lyons says it's a private enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| Well, I have a private business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| and I don't like government controls or government involvement too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| This is a situation where government needs to be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| because what happens after 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| There's no guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| What we're basically looking at now is building new mental health institutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| All the mental institutes were emptied in the 70s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| and there's our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| Now we're starting to have to deal with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| and I thank the mayor and I thank the city for finally addressing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| Since the 80s it's really bothered me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| because these people can't take care of themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| But this is not the plan to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| I think we need to really look at it seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| as how we look at it from the medical standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| You've got some new council members here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| This was turned down twice by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| The last time 13 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| Now that should hold some weight with city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| I was surprised that city council overrode that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| That usually doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| The communities are not behind this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| and you need the communities behind this to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| This group has said before that they know the communities are against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| but they're going to push it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| That is not good government. It really isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| And I'm disappointed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| And what would I do if I were in charge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5186)|
| 1:26:32| First of all, if we are real successful with this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| we will kill ourselves with our success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| because every city would come this way because it's so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| I think, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| I think all the mayors in the states should get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| and try to come up with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| Then contact the governor to contact all the governors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| This has to be a national program if it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| It's just like California is having such a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| with people coming across the border because they've got such good services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| You can't blame these people for wanting to get in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| Same thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| So I think we need to drop back and look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| and get together with a national plan some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| But that's all I have to say. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| Thanks, Ron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| Ron Peabody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5243)|
| 1:27:29| Good evening. My name is Ron Peabody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| 625 South Gay Street, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| Like most people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| I had very little knowledge of what the 10-year plan was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| before the Teeberry Lane proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| just six, seven weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| Since then, I've read literally hundreds of newspaper stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| and many dozens of technical studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| examinations of this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| and the subject of Housing First around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| Our community had a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| as has been alluded to a few times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| on the 10-year plan at the Arnstein Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| And I've spoken with all the council members now on city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| as well as John Lawler of the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| and Dr. Lyons of the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| I know much more about Housing First| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| and the scattered site approach as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| as the linear approach, which is kind of the more traditional form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| of dealing with the homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| and the campus approach to the homeless housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| I still know very little about how the 10-year plan will address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| the therapeutic addiction service needs of the homeless patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| as it has pledged to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| This is why I and my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| created the therapeutic services cost pro forma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| and requested that the 10-year plan provide the financial cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| that the pro forma asks for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| Basically, we the taxpayers need to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| what is being asked from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| We need to understand this 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| and, quite frankly, I think most of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| don't really understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| And we feel that we have a right to be part of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| I've emailed the therapeutic service cost pro forma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| to each member of city council, 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| the advisory board of the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| and we're very sincere in wanting to find a real solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| to help the homeless here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| Tonight we've heard the feelings of people in the south Knox community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| near Flinnegan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| They have many of the same questions that the people at Dubus Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| and Teeberry Lane have had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| What we want to know is simple and it's quite fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| The taxpayers need to know what the needed therapeutic addiction services are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| who will provide them, where will they be provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| and what the cost will be to Knoxville taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| Do we all feel that this is an unreasonable request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5392)|
| 1:29:58| Let me turn my page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5398)|
| 1:30:04| Tonight we've heard that the 10-year plan will use local agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| as well as TennCare and Medicaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| to provide these therapeutic addiction services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| Quite frankly, how do we know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| Are any of these agencies here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| Isn't it time for accountability with the 10-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| This is a big issue for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| When we were told that TennCare will deal with the needed therapeutic services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| how realistic is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| We have a park here in Knoxville named for Ashley Nicole Maynes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| a local 14-year-old girl who is a quadriplegic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| because of a traffic accident 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| She was denied TennCare this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| I have to ask you, if Ashley Maynes was cut off from TennCare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| can we say that those funds will be there for therapeutic addiction services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| or any of the other supportive costs that are needed a few years from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| Can you tell me what will happen when the funds dry up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| I appreciate Dr. Lyon's presentation earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| that there will be no city cost involved at the current plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5462)|
| 1:31:08| but what happens over time when the current providers run out of money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5468)|
| 1:31:13| This is a big question for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| We in Knoxville have to pay for these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| I've been asked by several council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| what my ideas are for the homeless problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| and I want to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| This weekend I'll be volunteering at VMC to serve breakfast with my family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| through a program our church has provided for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| We've volunteered there for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| But I believe helping means helping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| Enabling addiction is, quite frankly, not helping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| If you walk a dangerous gauntlet with no sidewalks to get food, medicine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| and to the bus stop, it's not helping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| I want you to understand how I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| We're asking you for accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| We're asking you to be part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| We're asking you to find a sustainable program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| that does not enable drug addiction with taxpayer dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| be they federal, state, or local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| We're asking for a real program that truly helps homeless people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| with mental issues and drug addiction problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| By council's rules, someone speaking in favor has a two-minute response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| I don't know if somebody would like to do that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| or anybody who's here in favor, I guess, could theoretically get up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| You have two minutes to respond to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| Would anybody like to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| We can move on to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5558)|
| 1:32:41| I guess this council has lots of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| and so you'll have plenty of time to talk if nobody wants to do that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| I'm going to move on to questions and answers at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| I'm going to start with Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| I know Ms. Witherstone from VMC is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| and I know VMC handles the case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| There's no alcohol or addiction treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| and it almost sounded like people think we're encouraging people to remain addicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5591)|
| 1:33:16| And I wonder if you could tell us what does happen with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| what are the requirements, how does the program work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| and how successful it is or is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| If you could start with your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| Jenny Witherstone with the Volunteer Ministry Center, 511 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| And thank you for that question, which I want to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| But before I do that, I want to back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| and make sure that everybody understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| that a resident of permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| and notice I say resident, not patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| A resident of permanent supportive housing is somebody who has made the choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| to move into permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| knowing full well what the expectations are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| and what the level of accountability is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| They choose to move in because they're aware of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| that they have problems and that those problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| are what caused their homelessness in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| They want help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| We are not pledging tonight to offer addiction treatment services on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5650)|
| 1:34:18| If that is what is required and if that is what the person needs or wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| then there are treatment facilities that would be appropriate for that individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5663)|
| 1:34:29| The person who moves into permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| will have a case manager who knows them well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| knows their background and their problems well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| and knows along with the individual what to watch out for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5679)|
| 1:34:44| We do not ask them to sign an agreement because it would be unrealistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5684)|
| 1:34:51| There is not a lease in town for any apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5691)|
| 1:34:55| And this is first and foremost housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| That they will never have an alcoholic beverage on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| We do not require that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| In some instances people will move in who do not have that problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| who are working, who may want to in fact have a beer after work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| That could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| As well it could happen that there are people who are alcoholic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| or who do have a substance abuse problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| The case manager's job then is to keep an eye on that person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| to watch that person's behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| The goal for permanent supportive housing is to help that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| address their problems in a way that allows them to totally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| and completely maintain their housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| There are services in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| There are outpatient drug treatment facilities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5745)|
| 1:35:49| There is N.A. and A.A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| And we have seen excellent success with residents who use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5752)|
| 1:35:56| those particular services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| Yes, Jenny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5762)|
| 1:36:08| I was actually going right where he was going to go in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| I wanted to have a clear sense of the therapeutic model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| And I'll just say this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| I'm in support of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| I'm voting in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| That does bother me about the people being able to bring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| alcohol into the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| Not so much for them but also for the other members who are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5793)|
| 1:36:38| recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| I also get the piece about selecting participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| What I heard you say is you choose people who want to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5809)|
| 1:36:55| But do you also have the option of saying no to somebody just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| because they say they're going to help themselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| I work in the same field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| And so you have that kind of radar that is able to sense who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5826)|
| 1:37:13| really has hit their head against the wall enough and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| ready for change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| I think that's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| I think the key to the whole thing is the relationship with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| the case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| And it begins before housing begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| It begins with an acknowledgment that first of all the person is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| homeless and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| And you begin to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| And you know the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| And they choose a program where they know that the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| management relationship will be such that it's not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| supportive but it also contains that element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| I definitely get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| A human being has to be behind their own steering wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| And the whole process is not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| And so we're creating a process for those people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| legitimately are seeking change and can benefit from change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5888)|
| 1:38:12| We have a supportive residential that allows alcohol in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| In other words, everybody across the country is working with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| model, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| And aren't they experimenting with the model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| Do we have the flexibility to make changes to our model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| I think that flexibility is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| And there are models all the way across the country that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| include one program that I am aware of that is called a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| wet house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| This is not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| The wet house is where a chronic inebriate, if they withdraw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5929)|
| 1:38:54| from alcohol, is going to be in serious physical pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| This is not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| Are we going to be on the ground here, a learning community, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| able to make adjustments to our own program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| I mean, we have to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| And the reason I'm confident saying yes is because I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| that's what's been happening over the last number of years with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| the permanent supportive housing that is already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| You mean already in place here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| Yes, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| Where would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| The first one that comes to my mind is the Jackson Apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| on the third floor of our building on the corner of Jackson and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| Gay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| But in addition to that, Pleasant Tree Apartments has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| operating for I don't know how many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| Permanent supportive housing for mentally ill women and children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| Catholic Social Services, Catholic Charities, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| operates permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| There is another program called Positively Living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| There is all of this that has been in place for a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=5997)|
| 1:40:01| years and from which we have learned valuable lessons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6001)|
| 1:40:07| You heard the woman who has fears that we are enabling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6007)|
| 1:40:13| addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6013)|
| 1:40:16| I don't know if I heard, she's not in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6016)|
| 1:40:21| She's hearing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| And so it's very understandable she might have that impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6024)|
| 1:40:28| based upon the things that she hears that we're enabling because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6028)|
| 1:40:35| of this sort of voluntary dimension to our treatment, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6035)|
| 1:40:40| What would you say to her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| I understand where that's coming from, but I would say that an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| addiction is the very thing that will threaten your ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| maintain your housing over the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| In fact, it may have been an addiction that ended you up in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| street in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| And that addiction then needs to be dealt with if you are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| to maintain housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| You know, when I was speaking to Mr. Peabody on the telephone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6066)|
| 1:41:09| the people who are very much opposed to this, at least the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6069)|
| 1:41:13| people I spoke to, very rational, had good insight, were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6073)|
| 1:41:18| constantly reassuring me that they cared about the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6078)|
| 1:41:22| They had good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| But it did bring me back to this notion, can we change our model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| Can we tweak our model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| Do we have practitioners of this model that we can come back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| we can say, you know what, this is not working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| Or it's not quite working in quite the way we want it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| Perhaps, I mean, can we legally not, I mean, can we not make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| restrictions on alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| One thing I would point to is the fact that when the Jackson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| apartments opened, when they began in 1992, I believe it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6113)|
| 1:41:59| we had not heard about Housing First.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| Ten-year plans had not then swept the country or begun in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6122)|
| 1:42:07| 350 cities where they now exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| We entered this apartment arrangement with all good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6130)|
| 1:42:14| intentions and with the idea that this would be the first step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| this would help get people off the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| And it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| But I would be less than honest if I didn't tell you that it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| not as successful as we had wanted it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| What was missing, the component that was missing was the marriage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| of the housing and the case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| And after the ten-year plan came into being here and after we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| a chance to study best practices across the country and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| realized what a key component that was, then we changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| programming and changed it dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| Good. I'm going to let other people answer their questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| I think Ms. Roddy was next and then I'll go to Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| This is for Ms. Weatherstone as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| Again, some of the questions that were asked tonight, very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6183)|
| 1:43:08| probing questions, had to do with the responsibility and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| accountability that the residents will be held to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| And I know Mr. Lawler provided us a fact this week that since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6195)|
| 1:43:19| July 08, when permanent supportive housing has been underway in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| Knoxville, 87% of those housed are still in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6203)|
| 1:43:27| Can you tell us what happened to the 13% that aren't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| What standards of responsibility or accountability did they not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6215)|
| 1:43:39| And how do we address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| The figures that you were provided, I believe, are city-wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| figures and include placements that have been made by a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| of other agencies, not just the Volunteer Ministry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| I'm much more comfortable talking about the placements that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| have been made at the Volunteer Ministry Center or by our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| And what I would want to tell you is that there are a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| placements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| We don't count just placements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| We count maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| So a success is not the placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| The success is the maintenance of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| And when I say maintenance, I'm talking about a minimal period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6261)|
| 1:44:25| of one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| When that person has been in housing and receiving the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| of case manager and doing well, one year later, we will begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| to refer to that as a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| And our success rate actually is slightly higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6279)|
| 1:44:43| I would also hasten to tell you that it is not perfect and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| I cannot tell you that we will have or that we do have 100%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| success because we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| We have about 9% that will fall out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| And in many instances, it is because they found that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| could not handle the accountability or the rules were too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| In some instances, it is not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| It is because they are reconciled with the family and they may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| be reunited with the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| Those things can happen as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| There have been several evictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| Not more than one handful, I would say, of the placements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6325)|
| 1:45:29| that we have made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| But our goal, if it looks as though permanent supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| housing with someone we are working with is not going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6335)|
| 1:45:38| successful, our goal is to make sure that they do not return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| to the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| It is to look for an alternative placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6345)|
| 1:45:48| KCDC follows the same model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| We do not want to return people to the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| I would want to underscore that that is a very small number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| Tell me more about the accountability that you require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| Someone who doesn't make it in your program, I understand they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| might decide that they don't have the commitment level, they go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| back to family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| But for community members and neighborhoods that are fearful of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6372)|
| 1:46:15| this program, what are your standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| I understand we have talked a little bit about alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| Obviously illegal drugs are illegal drugs no matter where you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| They are illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| They would not be allowed in a permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| Are the residents drug tested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| Who is keeping up with the kinds of things that community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6399)|
| 1:46:42| are fearful about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| If illegal drugs is an issue, there could be an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| that is going to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| If an individual fails a drug screening, for example, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| they fail a second one, then that is actionable in terms of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| case manager saying we have a problem here that needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| We need to get more serious than we have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| Let's talk about outpatient treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| What do we need to do to help you get over this hump, to face this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| problem so that we can address it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| There are regular meetings with the case manager and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| In a situation where you have case management on site, several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| advantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| One is that normally the building is configured in such a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| that the case manager will see the individual on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| The offices are by the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| They are by the mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| They are by the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| You will see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| In addition to that, there are regular meeting times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6467)|
| 1:47:50| In addition to that, there are activities that are set up by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| case manager to allow more opportunities for that kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6473)|
| 1:47:56| interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6476)|
| 1:47:59| Also to allow opportunities for a sense of community to build, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| replace what could have been the negative community on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6482)|
| 1:48:05| outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6485)|
| 1:48:09| Is that responsive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| In terms of the concern that permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| enables addiction, this kind of expectation or agreement is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| written into a contract or agreement with the supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| services counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| There is an individualized case plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| When I say individualized, the important thing is that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| individualized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| When I say individualized, the important thing to know is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| every single person is different and comes from a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6520)|
| 1:48:43| background with different needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| The plan has to be individualized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| That is written into the agreement with the case manager, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| into the lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| It is written into the agreement with the case manager if that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| appropriate to that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| I have some other questions, but I will let some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6541)|
| 1:49:04| people answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| Part of the 10-year plan, I understand, also has to do with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| work program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6550)|
| 1:49:13| The people that you have on your program, how does a work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| program tie into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6556)|
| 1:49:19| What exactly is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6559)|
| 1:49:22| I will address what our case managers do with respect to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6562)|
| 1:49:29| The individuals who are placed, and that is an inaccurate term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| and I'm sorry to use that, but who choose and who we help move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| into, who we help into permanent supportive housing, many of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6576)|
| 1:49:41| by virtue of their disability will be unable to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| competitively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| The goal then is to find some constructive, meaningful other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| activities to do during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| There are, however, a number of individuals who can work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| independently and competitively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| Maybe not full-time, but do have something to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6600)|
| 1:50:06| In particular, I'm very proud of what the case management staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| has done to find the kind of employment that is appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6609)|
| 1:50:15| suitable, and that gives that individual a sense of real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| accomplishment and a few extra dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| Again, that is taken on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6623)|
| 1:50:30| With those individuals who are appropriate for the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6630)|
| 1:50:35| I think one of the concerns or one of the questions that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| been asked of me is that the people, the potential folks that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6638)|
| 1:50:43| are going into this, that there are some individuals, say, out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6643)|
| 1:50:47| of the 48 that we're looking at in this particular situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| that may not have a job or may not be working full-time, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| you've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6653)|
| 1:50:56| If I was to use the term that was questioned to me, these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| folks will be hanging around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6659)|
| 1:51:02| What will they be doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| What's the difference between a Flinnican project and a shelter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| I think that's one of the big concerns that I'm hearing in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6668)|
| 1:51:11| last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| If I may, I'm going to reference a particular situation where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| there was a married couple who had been homeless for 12 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| expressed a desire to deal with their problems, to move into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6681)|
| 1:51:24| housing, and so they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6684)|
| 1:51:27| We were able to help them make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| She came from a painful, abusive childhood, and the only good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6690)|
| 1:51:36| memory, the only positive, nurturing relationship that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| had been for her had been her grandmother who had taught her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| how to sew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| When they moved into housing, one of the things that we did was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| get her a sewing machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| We began to see the commitment to that housing solidify the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6712)|
| 1:51:58| that she told us that she had started to make a quilt for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| first bed that they had ever had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| She was a diligent seamstress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| She also joined a craft group that was meeting weekly in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6727)|
| 1:52:13| apartment complex where she lived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| She learned to crochet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| She undertook the project of crocheting a dishcloth for every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6740)|
| 1:52:25| single resident of that apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| The procurement of that sewing machine was far more important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6748)|
| 1:52:33| than I can tell you because it not only gave her something to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6753)|
| 1:52:39| but it gave her a sense of who she really could be, and it gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6759)|
| 1:52:43| her back a sense of having a life that meant something and where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6763)|
| 1:52:48| she could do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| That's the job of the case manager, to see what is needed, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| create those opportunities and to make sure that happens for every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| What is your, and I know you and I have talked about this in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| last couple of weeks, but in the Jackson Avenue, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| what's the turnover rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| What's the success rate of folks coming in and moving on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6790)|
| 1:53:16| We've had one eviction in the past 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| And what's generally the length of stay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| Oh, gosh, I would have to give that in terms of an average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| I will tell you that there is a gentleman currently living there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| who was living there before I got there 13 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| He is the only one that I can think of that has been long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| He does extremely well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6819)|
| 1:53:42| He needs the case management, and with that, he does extremely well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6822)|
| 1:53:47| The other residents, there has been turnover four or five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| Again, a few have been reconciled to family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6831)|
| 1:53:58| Several have gotten jobs and moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6838)|
| 1:54:02| That is a goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| This is called permanent supportive housing, and the permanent part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| refers to the fact that there is a lease and that rent is paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6848)|
| 1:54:14| It can be permanent, as in long term, if that's what it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6854)|
| 1:54:20| But our hope is that for many, many of the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| it will provide the kind of support that they don't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6863)|
| 1:54:26| they're not getting, can't get from a family or whomever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| They get that support from the community through us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| and life gets better, they get better, they get stronger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| and they can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| And then one other question, and then, Mayor, I do have some other questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| but I'll do, you know, pass the mic around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| Jenny, you had mentioned earlier that there are a number of either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6886)|
| 1:54:50| organizations or facilities in town that do take care of the homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6890)|
| 1:54:55| and apparently through your program, you have been able to place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| these folks in different places, and I guess this is a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| both to you and probably to Mr. Nance, in terms of, let me back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6904)|
| 1:55:10| just a minute, when I really fully began to get involved in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6910)|
| 1:55:13| I found out really what a passionate community that we really do have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| I mean, a compassionate community in terms of the homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| that a lot of times I think what we think is when we drive down Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6920)|
| 1:55:25| we think of just the shelters and we think of these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| And it's been interesting to me in the last couple of weeks in really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| researching this and getting involved and asking questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| that our community does offer a tremendous amount of services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6934)|
| 1:55:39| to the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| And one of the questions that's not clear in my mind is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| as of today, as far as supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6945)|
| 1:55:50| how many units do we really have in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| both in terms of what you know with your program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| and then also, Mr. Nance, in terms of KCDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6957)|
| 1:56:01| I'd like to know what those numbers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6961)|
| 1:56:05| I can speak for the 17 that the Volunteer Ministry Center has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| and I don't have a count of the exact number of beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6969)|
| 1:56:14| John, do you have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6974)|
| 1:56:18| Jamie, how many are at Pleasancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| Does the 10-year plan folks know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6981)|
| 1:56:24| 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| John, use the microphone please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6987)|
| 1:56:30| $1,400 Main Street, 10-year plan office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6990)|
| 1:56:34| When I gave you all the workshop a few months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| one of the things I provided you was a slide that had the total number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=6997)|
| 1:56:40| of permanent supportive housing units in Knoxville on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| I don't have that with me right now, but I'm sure you have that in a file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| close to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| But the other thing I think you're referring to is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| the majority of individuals that Jenny has placed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7012)|
| 1:56:55| she's placed in existing affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| KCDC or other affordable housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| So the total of chronically homeless individuals we've placed since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| July 1st of 2008 is 318 individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| and that's what Marilyn was referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| The 87% of those are still in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| So roughly 284, I think, individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7033)|
| 1:57:17| are in permanent supportive housing in Knoxville right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7037)|
| 1:57:21| But those were placed through the 10-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| They were placed through all of our partner organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| whether that's Helen Ross McNabb, whether that's Child and Family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| whether that's Catholic Charities, whether it's CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| All of them have kind of shifted their thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7055)|
| 1:57:38| and are working cooperatively to move people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| from homelessness into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7061)|
| 1:57:45| I guess I ask the same question to Mr. Nance in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7065)|
| 1:57:49| is what you folks have placed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7069)|
| 1:57:53| is that in addition, the numbers that I received today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| is that in addition to what the 10-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| Those are current numbers. That includes our numbers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7079)|
| 1:58:03| His numbers include your numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7086)|
| 1:58:09| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| And again, what did you say the total was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7092)|
| 1:58:15| I'm sorry. I'm trying to balance this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7095)|
| 1:58:18| Well, you won't be able to balance it out because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7098)|
| 1:58:21| we've placed 318 homeless individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7101)|
| 1:58:24| We have 284 of those that are currently in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| We've placed 318 and 87% of those are still in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7107)|
| 1:58:30| What you probably have from KCDC is everyone who's come to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7110)|
| 1:58:33| episodically homeless and chronic homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| that had a homeless certification letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| that allowed them to have priority on the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| and get into KCDC housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| So Alvin places an enormous number of homeless individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| and a subset of that is the chronic homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| Well, then I guess that leads into my next question to both of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7131)|
| 1:58:57| Then why would KCDC not take this on and continue with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7137)|
| 1:59:02| Why are we building separate units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| if KCDC has this already set up to be able to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7146)|
| 1:59:10| Well, I think the way to address you, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| Councilman, is all of our housing through public housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7153)|
| 1:59:18| is available for people who have a homeless designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| That's one of our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7161)|
| 1:59:24| So it's a preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| So whether you're homeless or you're displaced or you're disabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7167)|
| 1:59:30| it will put you on our list as a preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| But I think that at times it's important for the community to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7173)|
| 1:59:37| that KCDC only have available amount of units to serve this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7177)|
| 1:59:42| So at times we're not going to be able to serve everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| that comes through that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| But we are prioritizing individuals who have a homeless designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7189)|
| 1:59:53| to be served first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7193)|
| 1:59:56| And I also understand that you do have case managers also to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7196)|
| 2:00:00| with the homeless?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| There are case managers who have been provided to KCDC to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| case management assistance to the high rises where we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7206)|
| 2:00:09| place the majority of the individuals who are being placed in KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| through the chronic, through the ten-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7215)|
| 2:00:18| I can't remember who's next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7218)|
| 2:00:21| I'm going to go to Councilman Della Volpe, then I'll work my way over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7221)|
| 2:00:24| I'll just ask a couple and then read to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| Starting with Mr. Lyons and then maybe Jenny following up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7227)|
| 2:00:30| everyone's been using the term case workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7230)|
| 2:00:33| And I still don't know what we're talking about when you count them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7233)|
| 2:00:36| and put a number on it in terms of a dollar value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7236)|
| 2:00:39| when she talks about servicing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| Are these social workers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7242)|
| 2:00:45| Are they medically trained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| Are they able to deal with psychological issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| Or are they simply someone who keeps tabs with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7251)|
| 2:00:54| What is the 2 per 48 residents that we've had in the numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| Okay. I'll defer to Jenny on that because we talked prior to my getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| When we use the term case manager, we are talking about a bachelor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7263)|
| 2:01:06| in sociology, psychology-related field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7266)|
| 2:01:11| and possibly with some experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7271)|
| 2:01:14| and most often with some experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| I will tell you that at the Volunteer Ministry Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7277)|
| 2:01:20| there is what I consider to be an excellent training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| and supervision provided by a licensed clinical social worker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| who is a master's level employee of the Volunteer Ministry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7286)|
| 2:01:30| Do you have trained nurses and people who deal with mental illnesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7290)|
| 2:01:35| and those types of medical professionals on your staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| Or do you just screen and find out where you send these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7298)|
| 2:01:41| to get treatment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7301)|
| 2:01:44| What do you do as your service in following up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7304)|
| 2:01:47| The case manager will do an assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| And in the process of doing that assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7310)|
| 2:01:53| we'll become aware of what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7313)|
| 2:01:57| We'll become aware of what areas need to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7317)|
| 2:02:00| and what the issues really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| They don't address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7323)|
| 2:02:06| They define them and then help them get services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| If it is outside their field of expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7329)|
| 2:02:12| they will refer possibly a company to make sure that it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7332)|
| 2:02:18| But I would also like to tell you that at the Volunteer Ministry Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7338)|
| 2:02:21| we have a collaborative arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7341)|
| 2:02:24| within the Volunteer Ministry Center main building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| There is a clinic that is operated by Cherokee Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7348)|
| 2:02:32| which offers medical and mental health care on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7352)|
| 2:02:36| We find that enormously valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| There is also dental care available as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| How many case workers do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7362)|
| 2:02:45| Currently we have seven and a half, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7365)|
| 2:02:48| who all work under the direction, supervision and training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7368)|
| 2:02:51| of a licensed clinical social worker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| who is not included in that number of seven and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7374)|
| 2:02:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7377)|
| 2:03:00| Mr. Lawler told us that once we got the information system in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7380)|
| 2:03:03| we discovered that the 800 number of chronically homeless was more like 1100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| and that was basically the universe of people that we were dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7386)|
| 2:03:10| And I guess my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| if it takes one case worker to work for 24,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| I guess you'd need about 44 case workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| Ryan's numbers, I guess we're talking about $2.4 million a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7399)|
| 2:03:23| to fund that kind of case worker support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| if that math just works out in a rote fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| So I guess the question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| can Volunteer Ministry handle that level of caseload management?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| We're talking here about Flinnican and 48 residents and two case workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7417)|
| 2:03:41| What do you do as you deal with a larger volume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| What happens to the system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| I am very grateful for that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7428)|
| 2:03:51| and I think that's something that we need to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7431)|
| 2:03:54| because you have been given a figure tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7434)|
| 2:03:57| of what that would cost approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7437)|
| 2:04:00| And it's approximately $110,000 to provide the case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7440)|
| 2:04:03| Or two case workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| Exactly, two case managers at a project like Flinnican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7446)|
| 2:04:09| And several things that I would want to say in response to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7449)|
| 2:04:12| Number one is the fact that our board of directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7452)|
| 2:04:15| several years ago went through quite a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7455)|
| 2:04:18| of redefining, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7458)|
| 2:04:21| who the Volunteer Ministry Center is, what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| We had been known for the provision of day shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7464)|
| 2:04:29| And we wanted not to do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7469)|
| 2:04:32| We wanted to do something that felt to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7472)|
| 2:04:35| like it had a greater impact and greater effectiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7475)|
| 2:04:39| And we began to align ourselves down the roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7479)|
| 2:04:43| of providing housing and case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7483)|
| 2:04:46| So some things that happened...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7486)|
| 2:04:49| Does that take you to being able to fund and manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| $2.5 million, $2.4 million, some bigger number than...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7492)|
| 2:04:55| Yeah, well, I'm getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7495)|
| 2:04:58| Okay, I'm sorry, I just want to make sure we're getting to the same subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| Because what happened is when we took on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7501)|
| 2:05:05| quite honestly, more difficult work, we also found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7505)|
| 2:05:08| that it's not only more difficult, it's more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| You can't just hire somebody with a GED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7511)|
| 2:05:15| You need professional people to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7515)|
| 2:05:18| We have, over the last several years, substantially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7518)|
| 2:05:22| beefed up, if you will, our fundraising efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7522)|
| 2:05:26| Still, the point that I would want to underscore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7526)|
| 2:05:30| is that at the Volunteer Ministry Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7530)|
| 2:05:33| we see homelessness as a community problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7533)|
| 2:05:37| We see the entire community as needing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7537)|
| 2:05:40| to be involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7540)|
| 2:05:43| They already are in terms of our fundraising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7543)|
| 2:05:48| in terms of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7548)|
| 2:05:51| Somebody has asked me over the last couple of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| well, are you going to come to the city for money for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7554)|
| 2:05:57| And this would be my response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| We already come to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7560)|
| 2:06:03| We already do receive some funding from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| that helps support the case management that we're currently doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| It's 3.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| It's a small percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7572)|
| 2:06:15| That's what it is. It is 3.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7575)|
| 2:06:18| And the question, again, comes back to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7578)|
| 2:06:21| if it gets to cover the full volume of this group of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7581)|
| 2:06:24| the 1,100 or thereabouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7584)|
| 2:06:27| can you handle that $2.4 million or thereabouts cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7587)|
| 2:06:31| from your organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| or are we going to have a failing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| that's supporting the people who are in the housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7600)|
| 2:06:43| Maybe John wants to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| I don't know. He looks like he's ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7606)|
| 2:06:49| One thing I would add to that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7609)|
| 2:06:52| as we are more successful in helping people move off the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7612)|
| 2:06:55| and into housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7615)|
| 2:06:58| what we see is the potential for realigning, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7618)|
| 2:07:01| or reassigning some of the staff positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7621)|
| 2:07:04| because we may not need the same staff number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7624)|
| 2:07:07| We may not need 7.5 case managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7627)|
| 2:07:10| who are providing services to people right now who are homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| We may be able to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| some of those salary dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| to help staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7639)|
| 2:07:22| these kinds of permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7642)|
| 2:07:25| Let's take the same problem in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7645)|
| 2:07:28| That is, would you have greater efficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| if you had a campus with 150 or 200 housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7651)|
| 2:07:35| and you could staff a central location somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7655)|
| 2:07:39| In other words, is there a better way to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7659)|
| 2:07:42| than in 40, 50, 60 kind of unit aggregations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7662)|
| 2:07:47| Is there some way to really do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7667)|
| 2:07:50| in a different way that's sustainable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7670)|
| 2:07:53| I think if your goal is reintegration into the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| the last thing that you want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| is to have people living on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| in what sounds to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| what amounts to be a homeless compound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| That does not encourage normalcy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7689)|
| 2:08:12| or return to a normal life at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7692)|
| 2:08:15| Your answer is no, that doesn't solve the main goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| of rehabilitation or stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7698)|
| 2:08:21| That's absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7701)|
| 2:08:24| I guess I was going to ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7704)|
| 2:08:27| to tell us a little bit more about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7707)|
| 2:08:30| say, Flennican, the example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7710)|
| 2:08:33| We have two caseworkers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| If I read this material that I received correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7716)|
| 2:08:39| they're there during the week, I assume during normal hours of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7719)|
| 2:08:42| 8 to 5 or 8 to 6 or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7722)|
| 2:08:45| 8 to 5. I would tell you, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7725)|
| 2:08:48| that as we see with Jackson Apartments now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7728)|
| 2:08:51| there is some flexibility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7731)|
| 2:08:54| In services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7734)|
| 2:08:57| In services, but also in scheduling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7737)|
| 2:09:00| It may be that one of the case managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| is planning an evening activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7743)|
| 2:09:06| or is working with someone who works during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7746)|
| 2:09:09| That case manager then will stay late a night or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7749)|
| 2:09:12| Do they stay at that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7752)|
| 2:09:15| or do they go to a number of locations during each day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| At Flennican and at these kinds of permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7758)|
| 2:09:21| their office is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7761)|
| 2:09:24| That is the great efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7764)|
| 2:09:27| When we place folks now in KCD facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| and in other places across town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7770)|
| 2:09:33| there is an inefficiency in terms of the case manager going to that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7773)|
| 2:09:36| Bouncing around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7776)|
| 2:09:39| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7779)|
| 2:09:42| What happens after hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7782)|
| 2:09:45| Who's there from 6 o'clock to 7 a.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7785)|
| 2:09:48| I guess if I were a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7788)|
| 2:09:51| who was going to go on the prowl nights and weekends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7791)|
| 2:09:54| it might be more exciting to me than mid-afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7794)|
| 2:09:57| What happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7797)|
| 2:10:00| We'll know when to watch out for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7800)|
| 2:10:03| I think the police are already looking for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7803)|
| 2:10:06| There will be, at Flennican,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7806)|
| 2:10:09| 24-hour, 7-day-a-week staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| What does that mean, staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| Is that a case worker or a case worker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7815)|
| 2:10:18| It is not a case worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7818)|
| 2:10:21| We use the term from time to time, case manager aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| It is somebody who has received specialized training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7824)|
| 2:10:27| who knows how to do active listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7827)|
| 2:10:30| and all those kinds of social work sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| But not a full-scale case worker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7833)|
| 2:10:36| But not a full-scale case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| Do I have to check in and check out as a tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| or on my own kind of recognizance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7842)|
| 2:10:45| keep my own hours scheduled, whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7845)|
| 2:10:48| It depends on how that particular project is operated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7848)|
| 2:10:51| I will tell you that the models that I am familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7851)|
| 2:10:54| is that you go by the desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| You have to go by the desk in order to go out the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7857)|
| 2:11:00| or to come in the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7860)|
| 2:11:03| But you're not told when you can go out or come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7863)|
| 2:11:06| or curfews or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| The difference is that if you are to have a guest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7872)|
| 2:11:15| and there are curfews for guests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| but if there is a guest, the guest must sign in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7878)|
| 2:11:21| and in some places that I have visited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| the guest needs to leave an identification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7884)|
| 2:11:27| that ensures that they will stop when they are leaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7887)|
| 2:11:30| and you know who is in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7890)|
| 2:11:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7893)|
| 2:11:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7896)|
| 2:11:39| I appreciate some of the questions earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7899)|
| 2:11:42| some of the bigger concerned questions pertaining to alcohol and drug use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| Some of the questions I have heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| and also Councilman Grieve's questions about employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| I wanted just to firm up a few things on the city's commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7911)|
| 2:11:56| Currently we spend $250,000 on the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7916)|
| 2:12:01| I guess, Dr. Lyons, maybe I can look to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7921)|
| 2:12:05| to confirm some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7925)|
| 2:12:08| We spend $250,000 on the office on the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7928)|
| 2:12:11| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7931)|
| 2:12:14| We spend approximately 3.3% for caseworkers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7934)|
| 2:12:17| I think the source of that funding is from a different budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| Jindy, would you like to address how those funds come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7940)|
| 2:12:23| The 3.3% is the percentage of the overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7943)|
| 2:12:29| volunteer ministry center budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7949)|
| 2:12:33| that comes from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7953)|
| 2:12:36| My understanding is that that really is pass-through money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| Madeline, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7959)|
| 2:12:42| That's the emergency shelter grant, which is the federal pass-through money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7962)|
| 2:12:45| We also have community grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7965)|
| 2:12:48| and block grants and some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7968)|
| 2:12:51| I just want to clear up for some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7971)|
| 2:12:54| I want to say this, too, that I really appreciate Mr. Peabody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| and others that have contacted me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7977)|
| 2:13:00| with some good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| The challenge just makes, I think, in the end, the final product better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7983)|
| 2:13:11| Now, when we have, like for instance on Teeberry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| we considered spending $300,000 on the acquisition of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7994)|
| 2:13:17| or something close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=7997)|
| 2:13:20| Now, was that block grant money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8000)|
| 2:13:23| Madeline, I guess I want to ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8003)|
| 2:13:26| Are we using some monies for this 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8006)|
| 2:13:30| that could be used in other areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8010)|
| 2:13:33| On an annual basis, we have the annual action plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8013)|
| 2:13:39| which in fact we're going to be talking about Thursday at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8019)|
| 2:13:42| In that plan, we outline the uses for the CDBG funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8022)|
| 2:13:47| the HOME funds, which is affordable housing specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8027)|
| 2:13:50| and the emergency shelter grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| Each year as we develop this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8033)|
| 2:13:56| then we recommend allocating those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8036)|
| 2:13:59| to different needs in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8039)|
| 2:14:02| We have a commitment to the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8042)|
| 2:14:05| This administration, our department, this council has had a commitment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8045)|
| 2:14:09| So every year we allocate some of those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8049)|
| 2:14:12| to permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| Again, this year I believe we have $250,000 in HOME again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8055)|
| 2:14:20| and $100,000 in CDBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| In addition, this past year, really in the end of 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8064)|
| 2:14:29| we had the Neighborhood Stabilization stimulus dollars that came down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8069)|
| 2:14:34| This was an initiative, again, of the Bush administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8074)|
| 2:14:40| We went to several trainings related to these funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8080)|
| 2:14:43| as we developed our plan for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| There was a heavy emphasis from HUD to use these dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| for permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8089)|
| 2:14:52| in addition to foreclosures and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| And so about $1.6 million or so total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8095)|
| 2:15:00| $1.7 million of the $4.5 million that we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8100)|
| 2:15:04| was allocated to permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8104)|
| 2:15:07| Part of that went to Menvela,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| and then now $800,000 is proposed for Flinnegan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8110)|
| 2:15:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8116)|
| 2:15:19| I'm going to ask John Lawler a couple of questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| Okay, Southeastern Housing is a non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8122)|
| 2:15:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8125)|
| 2:15:28| How did we become partners with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| and could you speak a little bit to others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| who might want to participate in what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8137)|
| 2:15:40| I saw Alvin laugh when somebody asked him why he wasn't doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8140)|
| 2:15:43| When I was hired to begin to implement the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8143)|
| 2:15:46| one of the key initiatives was permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8146)|
| 2:15:49| We understood that we had a big deficit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8149)|
| 2:15:52| when it came to a number of available units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| so we needed someone to wake up every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8155)|
| 2:15:58| thinking about how and where we'll develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8158)|
| 2:16:01| permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8161)|
| 2:16:04| We knew of Knoxville Leadership Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8164)|
| 2:16:07| and their relationship to Southeastern Housing Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| and so we approached them to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8170)|
| 2:16:13| could you partner and wake up every day thinking about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8173)|
| 2:16:16| Helen Ross McNabb, at that same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| began to contemplate developing some permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8179)|
| 2:16:22| and thus has been successful on Cox Street developing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8182)|
| 2:16:25| I guess they've developed 16 units there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8185)|
| 2:16:28| really 15, and they have a live-in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| and then they're going to do some on Baker Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| But there was no entity that had the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8194)|
| 2:16:37| to put together what you'll see is a pretty complex transaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8197)|
| 2:16:41| to make these things a reality, and Southeastern Housing Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8201)|
| 2:16:44| stepped up and said, we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8204)|
| 2:16:47| But the truth is, we would love it if Southeastern did it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8207)|
| 2:16:50| if KCDC did it, and if four or five other non-profits did it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8210)|
| 2:16:53| because there is that big a deficit of permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8213)|
| 2:16:56| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8216)|
| 2:16:59| But right now, there's only one entity that wakes up every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8219)|
| 2:17:02| and willing to do this, and that's Southeastern Housing Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8222)|
| 2:17:05| and we're thankful that they've devoted their resources to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8225)|
| 2:17:08| The contracts that go out of this go through a competitive process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8228)|
| 2:17:11| because it's federal money, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| That's right. Madeline didn't speak to that, and David didn't speak to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8234)|
| 2:17:17| but when you're using things like an SP or CDBG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| that will require the developer to procure the architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8240)|
| 2:17:23| and the contractor through a competitive process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8243)|
| 2:17:26| the architect will be procured through an RFQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| And so it's all competitively bid out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8249)|
| 2:17:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8252)|
| 2:17:36| So my question is to Ms. Witherspoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8256)|
| 2:17:39| I know you're tired of standing at the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| It's Weatherstone, but nobody ever gets it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8262)|
| 2:17:45| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8265)|
| 2:17:48| I just want to ask you, and you touched on it a little earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8268)|
| 2:17:51| and I want to ask you about medications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| and I know that everybody who's in permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8274)|
| 2:17:57| is not mentally ill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8277)|
| 2:18:00| but some will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8280)|
| 2:18:04| Now, who would be responsible for the taking of medication?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8284)|
| 2:18:07| Is that a joint thing between the resident and the caseworker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8287)|
| 2:18:10| or who would be responsible to make sure that persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8290)|
| 2:18:13| take their medication or on medication?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| It really is a joint thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8296)|
| 2:18:19| And again, it goes back to the relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8299)|
| 2:18:22| and it goes back to the case manager knowing the individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8302)|
| 2:18:25| and their particular level of responsibility, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8305)|
| 2:18:29| We've had really very good success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8309)|
| 2:18:32| with monitoring the medication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8312)|
| 2:18:35| with having people tell us when they're getting low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8315)|
| 2:18:38| so that we can make sure that the refill is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| when it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8321)|
| 2:18:44| I will tell you of one particular instance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8324)|
| 2:18:47| where the case manager was aware that the gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8327)|
| 2:18:50| was having a hard time remembering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8330)|
| 2:18:53| taking it on time all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8333)|
| 2:18:57| all that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8337)|
| 2:19:00| Wanted to, but was not managing that medication well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8340)|
| 2:19:03| That particular case manager was able to learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8343)|
| 2:19:06| that the medication was deliverable by injectable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8346)|
| 2:19:09| and make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8349)|
| 2:19:12| and then it was just simply no longer a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8352)|
| 2:19:15| for that individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| That individual was very grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8358)|
| 2:19:21| So it is a joint venture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8361)|
| 2:19:24| It is somebody realizing that they have a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8364)|
| 2:19:27| that they want to be responsible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8367)|
| 2:19:30| and working with the case manager to develop the skill to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8370)|
| 2:19:33| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8373)|
| 2:19:36| I have one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8376)|
| 2:19:39| I'm going to direct it to Mr. Lawler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8379)|
| 2:19:42| Looking into the future as we deal with this problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8382)|
| 2:19:45| of homelessness, and we have now already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8385)|
| 2:19:48| some permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8388)|
| 2:19:51| the term is a difficult question, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8391)|
| 2:19:54| How many facilities do you foresee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8394)|
| 2:19:57| the city of Knoxville in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8397)|
| 2:20:00| five, ten years, or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8400)|
| 2:20:03| how many facilities do you foresee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8403)|
| 2:20:06| that is going to be needed in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| to address this problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| I know that's maybe, just answer this best you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| Okay, give me a margin of error of 10 or 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8415)|
| 2:20:19| To answer that, let me tell you how many individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8419)|
| 2:20:22| that are chronically homeless in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8422)|
| 2:20:25| that received services in the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8425)|
| 2:20:28| That number is 959.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8428)|
| 2:20:31| Let me back up a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8431)|
| 2:20:34| Part of my charge was get an information system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8434)|
| 2:20:37| that all the homeless service providers use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8437)|
| 2:20:40| so that we really have a great way to know who is homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8440)|
| 2:20:43| what their degree of homelessness is, how to coordinate care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8443)|
| 2:20:46| That's called HMIS, our Homeless Management Information System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8446)|
| 2:20:49| According to HMIS, in the past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8449)|
| 2:20:52| there are 959 unique individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8452)|
| 2:20:55| that are chronically homeless that received services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8455)|
| 2:20:58| So let's round that up just to say 1,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8458)|
| 2:21:01| just for an easy number to play around with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8461)|
| 2:21:04| Our estimation is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8464)|
| 2:21:07| it would be great if we could place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8467)|
| 2:21:10| half of those in existing housing stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8470)|
| 2:21:13| and half of those in new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8473)|
| 2:21:16| As difficult as developing new housing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8476)|
| 2:21:19| we would love to see a greater percentage than 50-50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8479)|
| 2:21:22| in new housing stock and 50 in existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8482)|
| 2:21:25| But we will aim to develop these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8485)|
| 2:21:28| in blocks of 48 to 50 every year going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8488)|
| 2:21:31| until we see there is no more demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8491)|
| 2:21:34| So we'll use existing housing stock as much as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| but what our estimate is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8497)|
| 2:21:40| half of the individuals that are chronically homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8500)|
| 2:21:43| will need permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| that hasn't been developed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8506)|
| 2:21:49| Is that you done? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8509)|
| 2:21:52| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8512)|
| 2:21:55| Well, I'm going to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8515)|
| 2:21:58| a little bit different route here at first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8518)|
| 2:22:01| and then I'm going to get back to the mainstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8521)|
| 2:22:04| You know, as we look across these tables here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8524)|
| 2:22:08| we've got four council members and a mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8528)|
| 2:22:11| that are going to be gone from here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8531)|
| 2:22:14| in less than two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8534)|
| 2:22:17| One may be way sooner than that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8537)|
| 2:22:20| if things go as he wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8540)|
| 2:22:23| And one of the things that I noticed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8543)|
| 2:22:26| I mean, I've been involved with this Flanagan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8546)|
| 2:22:29| but this 10-year plan since I was on MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8549)|
| 2:22:32| I guess, I don't know, 15, 18 months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8552)|
| 2:22:36| And, you know, the vote was five to four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8556)|
| 2:22:39| that night, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| in favor to move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| So I think one of the things that we really need to consider here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8565)|
| 2:22:48| is that as I campaigned throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8568)|
| 2:22:51| you know, this 10-year plan was a huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8571)|
| 2:22:54| And people weren't particularly in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| of the way that it's moving under its current direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8577)|
| 2:23:00| So I think we need to be mindful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8580)|
| 2:23:04| of the new folks that will be campaigning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8584)|
| 2:23:07| just like the five of us were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8587)|
| 2:23:10| and how they're going to hold people's feet to the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8590)|
| 2:23:13| about how this process is moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8593)|
| 2:23:16| And perhaps we need to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8596)|
| 2:23:19| getting a more logical plan that people really buy into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8599)|
| 2:23:22| to where the city council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8602)|
| 2:23:25| at least have a super majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8605)|
| 2:23:28| if not, you know, at least seven to eight members of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| that say, yes, this is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8612)|
| 2:23:35| And, you know, I can go back and face my constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8615)|
| 2:23:38| and I can justify my actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8618)|
| 2:23:41| So that's one thing I think we need to be very mindful of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8621)|
| 2:23:44| And, you know, and I've really thought about this a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8624)|
| 2:23:47| for the last, you know, for the last two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8627)|
| 2:23:50| or ever since I've known this was coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8630)|
| 2:23:53| And, Jenny, if I could just ask you, I know we've warned you out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8633)|
| 2:23:56| but are there any, and I don't know the terminology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8636)|
| 2:24:00| but I'm going to say campus-like facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8640)|
| 2:24:03| throughout this country that are successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8643)|
| 2:24:06| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8646)|
| 2:24:11| San Antonio, Texas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8651)|
| 2:24:14| I will be quick to tell you I have not visited there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8654)|
| 2:24:17| My understanding is that that is a very new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8657)|
| 2:24:23| campus that has been established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8663)|
| 2:24:27| I'm not sure it's been established long enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8667)|
| 2:24:30| to even have any kind of statistics as to success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| I'm not sure what the goal of it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8673)|
| 2:24:38| And I would question the ability of that project to be successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8678)|
| 2:24:43| if the goal truly is to get people reintegrated back into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8683)|
| 2:24:48| I'm not aware of any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8688)|
| 2:24:51| There's none in the country that are in existence today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8691)|
| 2:24:54| for five to 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8694)|
| 2:24:57| I know of one, I believe, in Las Vegas that functions as a compound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8697)|
| 2:25:03| if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8703)|
| 2:25:06| I'm not aware of significant of any success coming out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8706)|
| 2:25:13| I want to go back a little more mainstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| I've worked for a message that I want to put into the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8716)|
| 2:25:20| and it's a little bit long, but I don't feel so bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8720)|
| 2:25:23| because it's not going to be near as long as some of the other ones have taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8723)|
| 2:25:26| But I do want to, this comes from my heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8726)|
| 2:25:31| and something I've worked on very hard and long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8731)|
| 2:25:34| The city of Knoxville has been tasked with providing services and shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8734)|
| 2:25:37| to one of the most unfortunate segments of our society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8737)|
| 2:25:40| the chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8740)|
| 2:25:43| It may well be true many of us don't want to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8743)|
| 2:25:46| how terrible it must be to be homeless in our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8746)|
| 2:25:49| Personally, I don't see how it is possible for any person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8749)|
| 2:25:52| with either a heart or a conscience to be a homeless person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8752)|
| 2:25:56| especially a family with children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8756)|
| 2:25:59| and not feel a pain, a sorrow, and or perhaps even guilt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8759)|
| 2:26:02| The homeless struggle daily for things most of us take for granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8762)|
| 2:26:06| having enough to eat, having shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8766)|
| 2:26:09| being surrounded by loving family members, and even pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8769)|
| 2:26:13| I cannot begin to imagine the feeling of despair and loneliness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8773)|
| 2:26:16| many homeless people must feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8776)|
| 2:26:19| I am truly sorry for the plight of the homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8779)|
| 2:26:22| and as one member of the city council, I want to help fix this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8782)|
| 2:26:26| Mayor Haslam and his administration have presented a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8786)|
| 2:26:29| they feel best for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8789)|
| 2:26:32| Bill Haslam is a person I respect and like very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8792)|
| 2:26:35| Bill comes from a family who has been very generous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8795)|
| 2:26:38| in giving back to our community, including the less fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8798)|
| 2:26:41| It is a way of life for Bill and his family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8801)|
| 2:26:44| and we should all recognize and be grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8804)|
| 2:26:47| But I cannot agree with the plan offered by the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8807)|
| 2:26:50| Most of my colleagues and all of South Knoxville are aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8810)|
| 2:26:53| I was deeply opposed to the proposed facility for the homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8813)|
| 2:26:57| at the old Flanagan Elementary School in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8817)|
| 2:27:00| due to the tremendous expense associated with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8820)|
| 2:27:04| As a member of city council, I do not see how it is possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8824)|
| 2:27:07| for me to be responsible and vote against such a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8827)|
| 2:27:10| in my own district, yet support a similar facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8830)|
| 2:27:13| in someone else's neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8833)|
| 2:27:16| That seems to me not only responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8836)|
| 2:27:19| but a violation of the public trust given me by the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8839)|
| 2:27:22| and it would be, I think, morally wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8842)|
| 2:27:25| It seems to me the current ten-year plan is one that intends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8845)|
| 2:27:28| to place permanent housing in every corner of the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8848)|
| 2:27:33| I just do not find that a logical approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8853)|
| 2:27:36| and I think it will be a source of constant and continuing friction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8856)|
| 2:27:39| for the council and the citizens we represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8859)|
| 2:27:43| Let me also say that I do fully understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8863)|
| 2:27:46| that under current federal law, the chronically homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8866)|
| 2:27:49| are considered a protected class of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8869)|
| 2:27:52| I understand we must comply with the mandated federal guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8872)|
| 2:27:55| and requirements, but I feel we can still meet those requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8875)|
| 2:27:59| and obligations by siting a facility closer to downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| in a campus-like atmosphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| The benefits of a centralized and single location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8885)|
| 2:28:08| should be obvious to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8888)|
| 2:28:11| Spreading facilities all over the city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8891)|
| 2:28:14| just is not practical, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8894)|
| 2:28:17| Keep in mind we are also required to deliver certain services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| and the greater the distance between locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8900)|
| 2:28:23| the higher cost of delivery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8903)|
| 2:28:26| I would remind my colleagues that the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8906)|
| 2:28:29| turned down a facility to be located in far west Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8909)|
| 2:28:33| at least partly on the basis of the distance of the proposed facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8913)|
| 2:28:36| from available services, and they had a legitimate point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8916)|
| 2:28:40| Considering the geographical size of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8920)|
| 2:28:43| I will be very surprised if that particular argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8923)|
| 2:28:46| doesn't emerge in every hearing in siting a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| anywhere outside the corporate limits of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8929)|
| 2:28:53| I can easily see the city of Knoxville having to extend transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8933)|
| 2:28:57| farther into the reaches of every area of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8937)|
| 2:29:00| and perhaps even the county, at a time when we have reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| services for others, including the disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8944)|
| 2:29:08| In our current economy, as a simple fact of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8948)|
| 2:29:12| the council has to eventually consider the expense involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8952)|
| 2:29:16| in not only building or buying an existing property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8956)|
| 2:29:20| for the ten-year plan, but in delivering efficiently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8960)|
| 2:29:23| the services required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8963)|
| 2:29:26| Even if the initial expense in building or buying a single facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8966)|
| 2:29:29| is far greater than the first phase of the ten-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8969)|
| 2:29:32| I think ultimately a single centralized facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8972)|
| 2:29:35| will be in the long run far cheaper than buying multiple properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8975)|
| 2:29:39| It will also make delivery of services cheaper as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8979)|
| 2:29:42| I also think the Knox County government will be much more likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8982)|
| 2:29:46| to extend aid to a single centralized location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8986)|
| 2:29:50| To me, it seems like common sense to call for a single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8990)|
| 2:29:53| centralized location located in close proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8993)|
| 2:29:57| to necessary services in Knoxville if the ten-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=8997)|
| 2:30:00| is to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9000)|
| 2:30:03| The city administration is assuring homeowners and neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9003)|
| 2:30:06| that numerous facilities throughout Knoxville will be an actual asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9006)|
| 2:30:09| to a particular community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9009)|
| 2:30:12| Then one could easily argue that a single centralized facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9012)|
| 2:30:15| will be a bigger asset for all concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9015)|
| 2:30:19| That having been said, I still wish to be part of the solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9019)|
| 2:30:22| and to fulfill our moral obligation to the homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9022)|
| 2:30:26| I will lend my support and work towards a single centralized location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9026)|
| 2:30:29| that will work to ensure the success of the ten-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9029)|
| 2:30:33| And I urge my colleagues and the administration to rethink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9033)|
| 2:30:36| where we are heading and support the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9036)|
| 2:30:40| of a single centralized facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9040)|
| 2:30:43| I appreciate the council and the audience for being so patient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9043)|
| 2:30:46| during my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9046)|
| 2:30:49| Thank you. I'm going to go to Councilwoman Palmer and then come back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9049)|
| 2:30:52| Vice Mayor. Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9052)|
| 2:30:55| I have a question first for John Moller and then I'll have a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9055)|
| 2:30:58| in response to Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9058)|
| 2:31:01| John, you mentioned that when you were finding a partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9061)|
| 2:31:04| to do the development of the housing, that Southeast Housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9064)|
| 2:31:07| was a partner that came to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9067)|
| 2:31:10| Did you advertise or solicit bids from any other non-profits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9070)|
| 2:31:13| or for-profits to build these facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9073)|
| 2:31:16| No, we had no knowledge of a non-profit in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9076)|
| 2:31:19| that had multi-family development experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9079)|
| 2:31:22| Southeastern Housing was the only one that had that experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9082)|
| 2:31:25| Did you not look outside of the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9085)|
| 2:31:28| No, not at that time we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9088)|
| 2:31:31| Okay. Thank you. Now, in response to Councilwoman Pavlis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9091)|
| 2:31:34| this week and over the past couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9094)|
| 2:31:37| when we knew this was coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9097)|
| 2:31:40| I have received a large number of calls, as I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9100)|
| 2:31:43| and emails, as I'm sure all the other council members have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9103)|
| 2:31:46| and I did not receive support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9106)|
| 2:31:50| for funding for Flinnegan from my constituents at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9110)|
| 2:31:53| These not only included people in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9113)|
| 2:31:56| many of whom are one or two paychecks away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9116)|
| 2:31:59| from being homeless themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9119)|
| 2:32:02| and they're worried about their own survival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9122)|
| 2:32:05| but also from people in other parts of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9125)|
| 2:32:08| and other neighborhood groups in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9128)|
| 2:32:11| And their feeling was, and it's something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9131)|
| 2:32:14| when I was running, that I talked to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9134)|
| 2:32:18| about, that scattered housing is not a good approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9138)|
| 2:32:21| if the neighborhoods are not involved initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9141)|
| 2:32:24| and want this in their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9144)|
| 2:32:27| The term cherry-picking was used more than one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9147)|
| 2:32:30| in reference to where the sites have been selected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9150)|
| 2:32:33| for the permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9153)|
| 2:32:36| and that is a huge concern among the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9156)|
| 2:32:39| not only in the 3rd District, but in the 4th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9159)|
| 2:32:42| in the 6th District, in the 2nd District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9162)|
| 2:32:46| and in the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| And I know the 1st District is really concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9169)|
| 2:32:52| When Flinnegan School was first proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9172)|
| 2:32:55| and I was a candidate for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9175)|
| 2:32:58| I was somewhat surprised when council approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9178)|
| 2:33:01| the move forward movement on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9181)|
| 2:33:04| I will not be supporting this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9184)|
| 2:33:07| and I will not be supporting funding for permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9187)|
| 2:33:10| supportive housing in a scattered approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9190)|
| 2:33:14| I'm sorry, thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9194)|
| 2:33:17| I guess I want to talk a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9197)|
| 2:33:20| about the single-campus model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9200)|
| 2:33:23| and then talk a little more broadly about my frustrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9203)|
| 2:33:26| with the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9206)|
| 2:33:29| I think the single-campus model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9209)|
| 2:33:32| you have sort of an interesting idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9212)|
| 2:33:35| The challenge becomes, if you want to build it next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9215)|
| 2:33:38| to existing services, the only location is next to McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9218)|
| 2:33:41| which is in an industrial park, so it means moving out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9221)|
| 2:33:44| existing jobs to create this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9224)|
| 2:33:47| or do what I understand San Antonio did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9227)|
| 2:33:50| which is build a whole new complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9230)|
| 2:33:53| So the siting becomes a real interesting thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9233)|
| 2:33:56| And I want to suggest, if we explore it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9236)|
| 2:33:59| and I don't think we should, and I'll come to that in a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9239)|
| 2:34:02| that we stop thinking about putting it downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9242)|
| 2:34:05| because downtown is more expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9245)|
| 2:34:08| we could move it downtown or eliminate some jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9248)|
| 2:34:11| at the I-275 business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9251)|
| 2:34:14| or take a big chunk of land someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9254)|
| 2:34:17| We actually have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9257)|
| 2:34:20| to build a whole new complex anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9260)|
| 2:34:23| which could include West Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9263)|
| 2:34:26| North Knox County, we could even buy some land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9266)|
| 2:34:29| in an adjoining county to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9269)|
| 2:34:32| And we could potentially move these people further away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9272)|
| 2:34:36| if that's what our goal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9276)|
| 2:34:39| And I worry about a single campus model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9279)|
| 2:34:42| that it always feels to me like that idea is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9282)|
| 2:34:45| let's put them someplace far away from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9285)|
| 2:34:48| And I don't think that's smart as a Christian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9288)|
| 2:34:51| and I don't think it's smart politically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9291)|

| 2:35:03| which means it can't be in a ghetto someplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9303)|

| 2:35:09| or Baptist Hospital, or any single location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9309)|
| 2:35:12| because there aren't many people then who care about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9312)|
