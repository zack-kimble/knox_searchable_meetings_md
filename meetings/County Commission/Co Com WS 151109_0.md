| 0:03:30| Number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=210)|
| 0:03:38| Number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| I just want some more clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| And also, 10 is already pulled, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=223)|

| 0:04:46| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| We will discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| It can be pulled at next Monday's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=288)|
| 0:05:07| 43 will be discussed at the meeting Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=307)|
| 0:05:13| If someone pulls it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| So when you say everything is on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| Everything except the ones that have just been named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| Now what about the discussion items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| And from 45 on down, 45 on down is for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=326)|
| 0:05:38| Do I hear a motion that the consent calendar is set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=343)|

| 0:05:52| Madam Clerk, the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| Before we get to the items, I need to have a motion for the approval of the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=361)|

| 0:06:11| Minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| Now, Madam Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| First item is item number five on page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| Resolution 201 is approving the Student Spaceflight Experiments Program, SSEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| agreement with the National Center for Earth and Space Science Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| a project of the Tide Center, a California 501C3 nonprofit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| for the Knox County Schools to participate in SSEP Mission 9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| to the International Space Station at a cost of $23,000 plus any additional potential expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=398)|
| 0:06:49| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| I just would ask that someone from schools come up, maybe Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=411)|
| 0:06:59| This sounds very interesting, but I have no clue what it is other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=419)|
| 0:07:06| it sounds like something I wish I'd done when I was in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| Do you have more details about what this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| I'm Jim McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| I'm the superintendent of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| We're at 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| Mr. Thomas, this is a wonderful program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| It is a program in the science disciplines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| and our participation in this program allows our students at the high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| and middle school level to compete to put science experiments on the International Space Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=454)|
| 0:07:41| And our kids, both at the high school and the middle school level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| have been successful in this competition in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| And, in fact, we've had a couple of experiments that have actually been selected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| to go up to the International Space Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| Now, we've had a couple that have actually, the rocket has blown up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| but that's real science, you know, that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| And you go back to the drawing board and you start again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| But it's an extraordinary program with NASA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| and really it's a wonderful opportunity for our kids to study the STEM disciplines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=483)|
| 0:08:10| and be able to do some real science that's going into the International Space Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| I just want to be sure I know how to explain it to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| And also, I can imagine how that would get a lot of kids more interested in science| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=501)|
| 0:08:28| and participating in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| So that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| Do I have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| I've got one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| Can he use his mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| He might have to stay down here because I have two or three microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Mike, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| We can hear you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| So last time this was just for STEM Academy, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| It's actually for several of our high schools and middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| The LNN STEM Academy has been one of the schools that has competed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| But this last time around, Dr. Alves is here, our chief academic officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| Last time we had a middle school team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| Was it from Gresham?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| And Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| And Bearden Middle School that competed and were successful in this competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| So, yeah, it's gone down to the middle school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| And we've seen, as Commissioner Thomas said, kids really get engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| and excited about practical learning in science when they know this is the potential outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| Well, some of these questions, particularly ones I ask from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| I may know the answer to, but some I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| But my main purpose is, just like Commissioner Thomas said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| he didn't know anything about this until, you know, now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| There's a lot of folks out there listening, watching, whatever, that don't know that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| And I think sometimes a discussion on these items before this body here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| puts that information out to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=595)|

| 0:10:21| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| Page 3, item number 10, Resolution 206,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| is approving a contract with School Bus Consultants, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| to provide an assessment of the Knox County Schools Student Transportation Organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| for the term of December 1st, 2015 through March 31st, 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| at a cost up to $53,400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| Yes, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| You just need to stay down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| We've got two or three for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| You don't have so much exercise unless you like exercising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| Again, for information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| I would like for you to kind of tell us where we are on the school bus transportation system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| what this is going to do and what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| and why we're trying to go out of state to get bids and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| So can you enlighten us on the bus situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| For me, this is a great opportunity for us as a school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| We spend, Mr. Oaks is here, he would be able to tell you better than I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| but probably about $12 million or $13 million a year on our student transportation program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| And this is an opportunity for us to really take a top-to-bottom review of our transportation program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=702)|
| 0:11:49| to look at our policies, our procedures, our operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| and to make sure that we're as efficient and effective in providing student transportation as we possibly can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| We want to make sure that we're utilizing the taxpayers' dollars wisely and effectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| and we want to make sure that our transportation program gets kids to school safely and on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| And so this is an opportunity for us to rely on some expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| to have a fresh set of eyes that have a great deal of expertise in the student transportation industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=733)|
| 0:12:21| to help us take a look and make sure that we're as efficient as we can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| Are we still short on drivers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Like many districts around the country, we've experienced some challenges in our contractors hiring qualified drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=749)|
| 0:12:37| We're in a much better position now than we were at the beginning of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| Our contractors have been able to identify and bring on several more drivers since the beginning of the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| and so we're seeing that move in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| Of course, we were able to reallocate some resources and provide an additional $600 per bus per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=769)|
| 0:12:58| from reallocating some dollars within the transportation program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| and our expectation was that at least 50 percent of that would go to the drivers employed by our contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| and I think that's, among other things, starting to have some positive impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| Yes, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| On this study, I was trying to figure, or I'd like to know what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| Are we looking at, do we have enough drivers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| Are we looking at the times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| Are we looking at the pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| I mean, what is it we're actually looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| All that stuff, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| Yeah, I mean, we're really looking at, you know, and Mr. Oakes is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| He can give you more of the specifics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| but it's really meant to be a pretty comprehensive review of our transportation program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| both from a procedural perspective and an operational perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| but also from a delivery of service perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| Are we structured the right way to make sure that we can provide transportation in the most effective and efficient way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=831)|
| 0:13:59| But Mr. Oakes can speak more to the specific research questions that we've asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| You know, several of the contractors have reached out to me in the past few months to tell their side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=845)|
| 0:14:12| and I do think they're honestly working as hard as they can, but they feel a little bit stretched sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| So I'm just wanting to know if we're doing this study to try to see if we need to go another route with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=858)|
| 0:14:25| or if we are just looking at the whole overall picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| I think we're looking at everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| I happen to think, and I've spent a good bit of time with some of our contractors over the last few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| I actually think that they provide a good quality service at a real value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| And I've been in other school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| I've seen other transportation programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| I think they provide a great value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| We rely on small business people who have roots in our community and have a stake in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| I think makes a difference in the service they provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| So, you know, I don't think this is necessarily anything that speaks to any deficiency we see in our contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=895)|
| 0:15:03| or any challenges with the current model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| We just want to make sure we're taking a hard look at our transportation program like we take a hard look at everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| make sure we're as efficient and as effective as we can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| And I agree that there are some significant economic challenges in being a bus contractor these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=913)|
| 0:15:22| The industry, you know, the standards have risen over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| We've raised our standards and our expectations around quality of service and safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| and all sorts of other aspects of the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| But we haven't necessarily, you know, school districts across the country haven't necessarily invested as much in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| transportation program commensurate with those expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| And so it is a challenging job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| But I think over time we want to make sure that, and you all have to be a part of that with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| to make sure that we do make that appropriate investment in our transportation program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| so that it is a viable business model for the contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| and they can really provide an appropriate service to our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| Let me add just quickly, a lot of the contractors mentioned to me they would be willing to buy the cameras for the buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=964)|
| 0:16:14| and then hope to be reimbursed later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| And I didn't know if that was anything that might be an option or not or where we are on that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=977)|
| 0:16:24| We're moving forward with installing two camera systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| So one's facing forward, one's facing back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| And, you know, that's a commitment that we've made, and we're moving forward in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| We've started installing those systems already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| You know, it will take us a little while to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| But they have the option of buying themselves and then putting them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| I don't think we've gone there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| I just want to say with respect to the cameras, we've already bought 90% of the cameras that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| We'll buy some more in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Where we are right now is negotiating the installation contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| and we should have that in place to bring to the Board of Education and the County Commission in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1017)|
| 0:17:04| Are there other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| I'll make also a comment to the question that was asked but not addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| Why did we go out of state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| I believe there was proper response from four or five competitively bid people responding to bid requests from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1034)|
| 0:17:24| and this contractor was the most credible and best bidder for this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1044)|
| 0:17:32| So this is not a purchase out of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| This is a purchase out of Knox County contracting, and this is the response of the street, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1055)|
| 0:17:44| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| Yes, while we're talking about transportation, I saw yesterday where it was the Department of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1065)|
| 0:17:53| but someone in the federal government has now authorized and endorsed putting seatbelts on school buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| and some states are already doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| How would that work in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Would we be responsible for that, or the bus operators?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| So that's a relatively new recommendation, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| from the National Transportation Highway Safety Administration, I think, is the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| But the question, I think, in Tennessee is really one of does the legislature want to make that a requirement in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1093)|
| 0:18:21| I think that's a recommendation that states need to take a hard look at, and is that a requirement or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1101)|
| 0:18:29| Of course, we'll follow whatever the law is and whatever applicable laws are enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| But I believe that's a change in their perspective and in their recommendation that's relatively new this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1115)|
| 0:18:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1126)|

| 0:19:19| for a term of seven years beginning December 1st, 2015 and ending November 30th, 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1159)|
| 0:19:26| with the option to extend for an additional three-year term with a cost not to exceed $238,975 in one-time fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1166)|

| 0:19:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Sometimes my old memory fails me, but a few months back I think Chris Caldwell came before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1200)|
| 0:20:09| and told us that Knox County's finance officer was going to be handling your payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1209)|
| 0:20:17| Now, that's what this is for, to replace what the county has been doing the last few months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1217)|
| 0:20:23| No, sir, this is Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| So we actually run our own payroll system in the Knox County Schools and have for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| And we have some 8,000 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| We actually have a pretty complex payroll that we have to put out on a periodic basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| So we've had our own payroll system, and this is both a human resources and payroll information system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1240)|
| 0:20:48| that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| The most recent, and Mr. Thomas, Bob Thomas, our assistant superintendent is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| can speak to this certainly better than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| But it's been about, I think our current system has been in place since the 1990s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| and it's served us well, but it really is time for us to have a system in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1263)|
| 0:21:11| that can have some enhanced functionality and really meet the demands of our current system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| The other great thing about this procurement is that the successful bidder is Munis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1277)|
| 0:21:25| which is actually the contractor that the county uses for finance, so therefore that we use for finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1285)|
| 0:21:31| So there's some great opportunities for alignment and synergy with the current finance systems that we use as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1291)|
| 0:21:39| Mr. Thomas, anything you want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Brown, Bob Thomas, Knox County Schools, 912 Southgate Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| and Dr. McIntyre is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| We've been doing payroll since, I think, the early 90s for school folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| and we've actually the system that we had back then or purchased back then is the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| and some variation that we're using right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| It was McAleer that we had recently purchased back in the early 90s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| and subsequent to that it turned next year and bought them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| So we've basically been using a variation of a system that we have right now since 1992-93 era.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1330)|
| 0:22:18| So as Dr. McIntyre mentioned, it's actually a human resources and payroll system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| It is the same system that the county uses for the financial package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| so we're hoping that there will be some better and more transparency, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| between our finances and also with Knox County's finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| But as Dr. McIntyre mentioned, the school payroll is pretty intricate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| There are numerous payrolls every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| Tracking all the information that we have to track is just now time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| I guess maybe a better analogy would be if you had a computer back in 92,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| would you be using that same computer system right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| So it's just outdated, and we're at a time and a point where we need to upgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| so that we can do business like we've been doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| So what's the cost, your annual cost of doing business now in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| Well, there's just, and again, I'd have to talk with our IT folks to get that exact information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| but we've been basically, what we've done and been doing, we've owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| So it's just been a matter of any kind of changes from a system perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| where we would make programming changes and things of that nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| that we would be responsible for paying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| So basically just the cost of any modifications to the existing system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| is what we would be paying right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| The first year you got, the way I read it, about a half a million outlay for the first year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| including the startup one-time fees, and then $257,000 plus every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1428)|
| 0:23:59| I don't know anything about these programs or what they cost or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| Mr. Caldwell, does this seem to be in line with what we might be doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| One thing, too, while Chris is coming to the mic, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| the hosting is going to be off-site, so that's basically what we're paying for in ongoing costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| We won't host the system in-house like we've done with our existing system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1462)|
| 0:24:31| Thank you, Dr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| I'm no IT expert like Dick Moran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| but instead of going out and buying about $200,000 worth of servers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| then they're going to just push that out like a cloud service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| That's where you would have that type of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| It's kind of the same, but instead of buying servers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| they're going to go out and you're buying a service instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| This is the system that we've used since 2011 on the county side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1501)|
| 0:25:08| It works great for us, and we've used it for our payroll and financial services, ERP as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1508)|
| 0:25:15| I think this is a good move for the schools to go on something that is the same system that we're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1515)|
| 0:25:24| It will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| Knowing that this is the same system that the county uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| I was wondering if we were able to leverage in this negotiation since we have both entities using it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1537)|
| 0:25:49| You're talking about in terms of the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| The negotiation, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| That's probably a better question for Mr. Caldwell or our purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| Once again, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| Happy birthday, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| No singing, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| I can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| I had it in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Since this is the same system that we're using at the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| were we able to negotiate leverage in any way to reduce costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| And is there any way in the future that we can join these contracts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| I'm sure that we could look at doing things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| I wasn't involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| But basically, the more things that we do with Tyler like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1588)|
| 0:26:35| then I'm sure we would get better pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| And they'll probably be viewed as separate contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| That way, if we ever moved away from it, then they can stay on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| But they may have took that into consideration as they gave us a price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| One last question, but first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| Chris, they had spoke about transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| With the reporting, will this make things easier for us to analyze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| and for them to analyze the reports generated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| I'm never looking at a payroll report from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| I can't say what the differences would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| But these reports are easily being able to PDF them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| and putting them on websites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| Now, we don't ever put payroll reports on websites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| But we do put our financial information on websites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| It's easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| Just to word about that, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| I think one of the reasons we're excited about this implementation is we do have a payroll system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| that's worked pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| But our human resources information systems is just sort of patchwork from the payroll system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1664)|
| 0:27:51| I think what we like about this system is it truly is both a payroll and HR system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| And it will allow us to not have to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| right now we're keeping a lot of manual logs and spreadsheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| We shouldn't be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| It should be all in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| We should be able to push a button to get information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| And I think it will be a lot more efficient in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| I guess this question will be for Mr. Thomas then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| Basically, if we're doing our math correctly, for the next seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| the total amount is going to be in excess of $2 million to do your payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| That would be correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Because, again, they're hosting the site instead of Knox County hosting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| A quick question for you because I've read this several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| and still want to make sure I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| Are the travel expenses for trainers at $54,000 plus every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1723)|
| 0:28:51| I don't think that the training would be every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| I know initially the first year you're going to have set up and training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| Just set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Chris says just to set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| The way it was in that sentence, I wasn't sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Just to follow up on Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| how much was it to purchase the servers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1754)|
| 0:29:24| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| Jay Garrison, Knox County Purchasing, 1000 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| I could get that information for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| I don't have it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| But because the schools decided to go with software as a service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| instead of purchasing the servers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| then we really didn't get that far into it, to be completely honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| But I can get you that information if you would like me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| Item 219, to approve the contract for Munis for the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1795)|

| 0:30:05| Item number 24, resolution 220,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| is approving contracts with NovaCopy and Rizzo, Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| in an amount not to exceed $2,500,000 annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| as needed for high-speed printers for 89 Knox County school sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| for the term of January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1822)|
| 0:30:28| with the options to extend for an additional four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| one year at a time, for a total of five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| Bob, Dr. McIntyre, whichever one of you all want to jump in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| This $2.5 million, is that purchasing each year or leasing each year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| We own the machines that I think that we have right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| and it's also click charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| We're charged so much for each copy that's made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| once you get above a certain number of copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| So this amount represents, in total, what we've paid for the machines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| as well as the additional click charges for all the copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| What we're hoping with this, and it's a large amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| that's about what we've been spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| Of course, these are copies that are out in the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| that teachers and other instructional folks utilize on a day-to-day basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| with instructional materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| So what we're actually hoping with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| we put the amount not to exceed in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| because that's what we've been paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| What we're actually hoping is to see a savings of $500,000 to $600,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| over what we've been spending with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| because Rizzo came back with a very good price on those copiers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| It's about half the price of what we've been paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| So we're right now analyzing everything that's out there in the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| and all the copies that have been made and put together a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| that will hopefully help us to reduce these expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| by anywhere from $500,000 to $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| Of course, that remains to be seen if we actually get that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| but that's kind of what we're hoping to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| Are these big jumbo office copiers, or are they desktop copiers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| The Rizzo's are the large, high-volume machines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| and the other contract there is for a smaller machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| It would not be the high-volume type machine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| so that we can put it in schools a combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| Maybe a school might need two high-volume copiers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| and maybe two or three low-volume copiers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| So that's part of what we're analyzing to see if we've got larger machines in schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| and what we actually need, and then to try to right-size that, I guess, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1972)|
| 0:33:02| So, again, in effect, we're going to be leasing these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1982)|
| 0:33:09| Yes, that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| I've looked at Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| She's our interim director for executive director for finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| Once you own them, I guess, from a standpoint, once you do own them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| and then they only last a certain number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| and you've got a high-volume number of copying machines that you've got to do something with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| either surplus or sell back to the company if they'll buy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| Does this figure include service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| I believe it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| So if one goes down in December, then they're going to run them another one out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| Or repair or replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Mr. Thomas, do you remember back in the late spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| you and I had a conversation about these high-speed printers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| and you had appropriated $300,000 for them at the end of the school year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| Was that to pay the balance of a contract that you had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| That was actually an extension for us for them to provide the service through December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2050)|
| 0:34:17| Of course, once the commission approves this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| what we're looking at would be a new contract period that would start in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| So that was for the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| Because the contract actually expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| Do you also remember in the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| you did a great job here of identifying the number of location sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| but do you remember us discussing the number of units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| Isn't it about 190 printers, something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| I believe that that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| Let me ask Liz to mosey on down this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| I think that would relieve some of the when people think it's just 89 printers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| when it's really double that or triple that or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| It's not just one per school because, again, you've got larger schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| like high schools, middle schools, some large elementary schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| that would be more than one copier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| But what we're doing right now is assessing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| For example, if a school had four high-volume copiers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| and once our assessment's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| we determine that two high-volume copiers would serve that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| then that's what would be allocated to that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| So it might not necessarily be the same number that a school has right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| but we will work with the schools on that and also with Dr. McIntyre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| as we work through this to make the allocations, if you will, to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| And in the future, if you don't mind, to put the quantities in there would help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| Oh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| To make it a little easier on us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| We'd be glad to report back to you once we've worked through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| and we can be able then to explain what we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| and what we're going to have, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| We'd be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| I think she's got your answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| How many printers do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| We are looking at 199.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| Name and address for the record, please, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| Liz McLeod, 912 Southgate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Yeah, just quickly, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| So if my math is right, we're spending about $40 per student per year for printing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2180)|
| 0:36:27| I want to make sure I heard what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| I think it's half as much as before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| It's $2.5 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| It's half as much as we've been spending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| No, we have been spending about $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| I think last year the actual expenditure was $2,468,000, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| I hear so much about tablets and everything's on computers and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| I'm hoping this number for printing keeps going down, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| Do you think it will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| That's what we're planning on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| As I said, what we're hoping is that we can save $500,000 to $600,000 off of this $2.5 million right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| Commissioner Schoonmaker, did you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| I did not, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| Somewhere in the budget process, I remember you all giving us a report that said there would be $500,000 to $600,000 worth of saving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2238)|
| 0:37:25| in printing, and is this what you're addressing right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| Well, actually, Liz and I talked about that today with the MOU that the boards approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2249)|
| 0:37:36| and the county commission approved looking for ways to achieve savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| So we feel like and we're hopeful that this will be one of those ways that we can achieve, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2261)|
| 0:37:48| at least a half a million dollars worth of savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| Liz wants to go further than that, but I'm not going to stand here and go further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| I'm going to tell you a half a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| She's hoping for much more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| But as part of the MOU, it's a cost-saving strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2280)|
| 0:38:07| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| I just wanted to say, as a parent, it's amazing to me the volume of stuff that comes home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| and my children's backpacks every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| And also we get a lot of phone calls on the automated system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| It seems like we get maybe three or four of those a week, and also e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| And I'm grateful for all the communication, and my daughters are not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| but I'm grateful for the amount of homework that they have coming home to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| But I also know that, especially at the schools in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| there's a lot of families that don't have a computer at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| And so the only way to get them information that they need is through papers sent home in a backpack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2333)|
| 0:39:01| So I hope that all the really important, critical stuff we're still going to be sending home in backpacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2341)|
| 0:39:08| and not through e-mail or through cell phone messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| Yes, ma'am, and we plan to take that into consideration with the allocations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| So we certainly don't want any student to be without the instructional materials that they need to make progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2357)|
| 0:39:25| It's amazing just the sheer volume of stuff that we get every week from the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| So like I said, my husband and I are grateful for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| The kids are not always, but you all do a good job communicating with families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| Seeing no further lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| My comments on this would be that during the Board of Education meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| my fellow commissioners, you have asked the same pointed questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| that were asked by the members of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| And the same credible answers were given then as given now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| The thing that I look forward to is the fact that both of these last two items that we've discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2397)|
| 0:40:04| are poised to give us significant savings in the long haul over the copying and computer work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2404)|
| 0:40:13| that's been done by the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| and both of these items are well worth the time and discussion to bring to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| What we have before us is Item 220, the approval of a printing contract of NovaCopy and Rizzo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2420)|
| 0:40:28| It's properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| Thank you, Mr. Thomas and Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| And Madam Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| So I am assuming that anything that comes from the schools to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| has already been approved by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| Most certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| After lengthy discussion sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| Wouldn't it be nice if we had a copy of some of those comments and questions and things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| It might save us a lot of time, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| The next item is on page 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| Item number 36, Resolution 409, is approving an on-call geotechnical consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2477)|
| 0:41:24| and materials testing services contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| This is Item 36, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| And the reason that it is not on consent is that there is a blank line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2492)|
| 0:41:39| Mr. VandeVe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Purchasing handled the procedure for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| We had actually six firms that expressed interest in the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| Four were determined to be responsive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| and S&ME was the firm selected as having the best overall pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| I can give you some boring details about geotechnical analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| and material testing if you like, but, again, it was managed through purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| and this was the most responsive bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| Is it going to be a motion to approve or no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| Well, we probably need to do no recommendation since we've done everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| I would agree with that, Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| but Commissioner Brown is making the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| I'll withdraw it then if you want to move it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| I mean, if you've got a name, you can go ahead and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| Send it on with that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| Is that your motion, Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| I'll second it as one, however it comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| Motion is before us to fill in the blank with S&ME.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| The motion is for no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| The maker of the motion is Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| Seconded by Commissioner Oynbee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| The motion, this is item 36, resolution 409,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2590)|
| 0:43:17| is to fill in the blank with S&ME for consulting and materials testing on a contract 2283.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2597)|
| 0:43:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| The next item is not listed on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| It was added, resolution 410.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| It is approving work order number three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| and the proposed scope of services in the amount of $144,300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| with Amec Foster Wheeler, formerly Amec Earth and Environmental Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| under the master services agreement designated as Knox County contract number 11-466| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2635)|
| 0:44:02| for the continued development of a permanent stormwater management program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| Do I hear a motion of no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| Commissioner Brown, I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| Is there any question or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| If not, the added resolution 410,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2660)|
| 0:44:29| motion to forward without recommendation is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2678)|
| 0:44:52| Mayor Burchett, is Mayor Burchett still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| Please, Mayor Burchett, escort Dr. Caldwell to the front, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2696)|
| 0:45:03| While they are on their way, this is point of personal privilege on my behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| please allow me this exception to our procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| Tomorrow, the Corrington Senior Citizens Super Seniors Group meets for lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| Anyone that would like to have lunch with the Corrington Super Senior Citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| please be there, 1030 for the program, 1130 for lunch, Corrington Senior Citizens Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2724)|
| 0:45:31| Mayor Burchett, thank you for the Senior Citizens Center in Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| I also would like to point out that Mayor Burchett has given me something that he received from his father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2736)|
| 0:45:47| This is going to be difficult for me to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| because I was commissioned an officer in the Signal Corps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| But somewhere way back there in the 70s, my second career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| my career at AT&T gave me my second opportunity at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| and my Aunt Mildred, Nancy Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| now don't be twittering on me here, Mayor Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| worked for Dean Burchett, so I got to lean upon her file cabinet while she helped me get in class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2777)|
| 0:46:25| I was 20 years out of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| Helped me get in class and get my degree from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| I know why Mayor Burchett acts in his spasmodic ways every now and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| is because my Aunt Mildred had as much influence on his upbringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| and dropping him on his pointed little head as anyone else in his developmental years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| So Mayor Burchett, I want you to know that I appreciate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| and the things that you received from your dad to think of me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| when you ran across this history of the United States Army Signal Corps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2818)|
| 0:47:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| This is actually the seventh anniversary of my father's, as I like to say, when he went to heaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| So I appreciate you remembering him in a good light because he was all about the military| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| and I'm sure he'd be tickled to death that you got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| And probably not tickled to death that you dropped me on my pointed head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| This is the truth, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| Now, wait just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| I appreciate you escorting Dr. Caldwell to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| In addition to and in connection with this book on the Signal Corps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2853)|
| 0:47:40| I had said tomorrow is the Corrington Super Seniors Luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| Wednesday is the Veterans Day Parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| This booklet reminded me, and I wore a pin today to remind me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| that I would appreciate anyone that could participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| or come out and observe the Veterans Day Parade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| because it looks like Wednesday is going to be the better weather day this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2880)|
| 0:48:07| So I would appreciate your being there for the Veterans Day Parade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| as it comes really close to this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| Now then, the reason I've asked you to escort Mr. Caldwell, Dr. Caldwell, to the front is get him up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| Tell me how old is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| How old?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Yes, I'm going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| How old?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| Well, you don't have to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| I don't wave illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| I can tell that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| So Dr. Caldwell's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| I'll yell to Sam McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| His age is not being contested now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| but as we all are candidates for singing on TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| we're going to sing Happy Birthday to Dr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| So I want you to say, me, me, me, me, me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| Happy birthday to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| Happy birthday to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| Happy birthday, Dr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| Happy birthday to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2944)|
| 0:49:11| That is why our ratings just slipped below WrestleTalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2951)|
| 0:49:18| Following Bigfoot anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| And thank you, Mr. Caldwell, for the service that you're giving to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2962)|
| 0:49:29| While I'm in the announcement mode there for just a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| Gerald Green, the MPC guy, is also here on the front row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2972)|
| 0:49:39| I don't know why he's observing us so closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| but I do want to recognize him and remind the full commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| that Metropolitan Planning Commission meets Thursday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| And then one last item, Friday, Juvenile Court Chili Cook-Off is Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2990)|
| 0:49:58| So support the Juvenile Court and their fundraising activities this coming Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=2998)|
| 0:50:08| Now, again, fellow commissioners, I appreciate this point of personal privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3012)|
| 0:50:19| Patch 12, item number 45, spread of record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| the distillery licenses issued by the Knox County Clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| to Knox Whiskey Works and Black Horse Pub and Brewery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| This spread of record will be read again at the regular meeting next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| Can we ask a question about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| Yes, most certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| Is there anybody here from the Knox County Clerk's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| Do you know the details of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| Oh, fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| Okay, well, awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| The question is, I noticed they pay a $1,000 fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| that goes from October 23rd of this year to December 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| and then on January 1st of 2016, what will they pay again as a fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| as part of the privilege tax for a distillery in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| For the entire year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| We are notified by the state as to who has a distillery permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3072)|
| 0:51:18| how much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| The standard is $1,000 for distilleries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| It varies with liquor by the drink privilege tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| And so whenever they're issued a permit, we're notified of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3084)|
| 0:51:29| And we also, even though these distilleries are in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3089)|
| 0:51:35| they have to pay the city, the county, and the state the same each time each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| Fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| Page 13, item number 46,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| Accepting Through Spread of Record Dr. Joseph B. Carsello's Letter of Resignation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| from the Knox County Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| This spread of record will be read again at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| Item 47, Discussion Regarding Appointment to the Knox County Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| This item 47 is related to the item 46,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| the process for appointment to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| Mr. Caldwell, would you help me tell this story, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3139)|
| 0:52:28| The procedure for selecting, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| the procedure for receiving candidate names is the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3153)|
| 0:52:40| We have already been in contact with TSCPA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| which is the organization that will recommend to us replacements for that appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3164)|
| 0:52:54| And if they do not respond, I think, within 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3174)|
| 0:53:00| then we would try to find someone on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| But we already began that process when Dr. Carsello let us know last week that he was resigning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3184)|
| 0:53:12| So the process has begun, and we will keep an eye on it and recommend someone ASAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3192)|
| 0:53:22| And this professional organization meets tomorrow night or tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| They do meet tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| They do probably at lunch, and we are hoping that they will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| and they will announce to their members there of this vacancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| and hopefully there will be a line of people just willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3222)|
| 0:53:48| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| Are there other questions of commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| Item number 48, discussion regarding Resolution 15-4-902 concerning annual MPC training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3236)|
| 0:54:04| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| As most of you remember, in April of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| we passed a resolution to opt back in to Tennessee Code Annotated 13-3-101 subsection J,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3250)|
| 0:54:19| which requires four hours of training and continuing education for MPC commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| And I've asked the Executive Director of the Metropolitan Planning Commission, Mr. Gerald Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| to come and give us a quick update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| My name is Gerald Green, 400 Main Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| The training required by this resolution has been going well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| Most of the commissioners have taken responsibility for receiving the training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3286)|
| 0:54:53| and have attended classes with the county appointees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| ranging in number of hours received from six to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| The only commissioner who has not received any training to this point is Commissioner Glenn Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3300)|
| 0:55:07| The others, again, range from six down to even one hour for Commissioner Mike Crowder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3307)|
| 0:55:15| whose appointment has not been confirmed by the State Appointing Committee at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| In fact, our chair has six hours, and the city appointees, they range from seven to zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3321)|
| 0:55:28| with Beth Easton receiving seven hours, most of the rest in the range of two or three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| Janice Toker receiving six hours, and Commissioner Jack Sharp receiving no hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3333)|
| 0:55:40| We appreciate this opportunity to encourage our commissioners to receive training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| I'm a firm believer that those who do a job should know about the responsibilities of that job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| and receive training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| We will continue to provide work with other agencies to provide opportunities for them to receive training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3352)|
| 0:55:58| One of the things I've done since coming to MPC as Executive Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| is had many training sessions at our agenda review meetings on the Tuesdays before our regular meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| In fact, Dr. Buchanan of the Health Department was there last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| talking about the link between individual health and the way our communities grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| This week, tomorrow, staff of the County Stormwater Engineering Division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| will be at that agenda review meeting to provide some information to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| So we're trying to get a good source of training and information to the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| to enable them to do their job well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| I'd be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| Oh, excuse me. Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| Mr. Green, we didn't set a deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| Have you set a deadline for them to have this training by or the route?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| We're trying to look at an annual basis so they get four hours each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| This year started in April, so we'll work with them to try to receive all that training by April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3416)|
| 0:57:03| Again, a number of them have received or exceeded the amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| and there are a few we've got to maybe push a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| What happens if three people don't have their four hours in by April 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| To be honest, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| I believe by state law then they can actually be removed from that position then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| That's what I thought, but I just want to be sure we're being aggressive enough to follow up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| Just a second. Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| Let's ask that question of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| I think Mr. Schoonmaker had it correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| It says this shall constitute a cause for the removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| I don't think it's mandamus, but it can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| and this body can only deal with the ones that they appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| So they need four hours worth of training, and they've got two months to get it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3469)|
| 0:57:55| I would recommend they get it in by the end of December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| because that's the requirement reporting time, if I recall, by the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| We'll let them know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| That was the question that I had with Mr. Green because we adopted the resolution in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| and, of course, the reporting time is December 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| So do they have to get three-quarters of the hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| or does it just start on a whole new year next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| It says annually, and I would assume that means from January to December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3503)|
| 0:58:30| Each planning commissioner shall, within one year of their initial appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| so it could vary from their initial appointment whenever they were appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| Was this October?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| We're opting back into this now, because that was actually in state law several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3519)|
| 0:58:50| Of course, the removal will be at the discretion of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| I would just recommend everybody get their four hours in by December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| They'll have no problem, no legal questions to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| It says each calendar year thereafter, we opted in in October or April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3540)|
| 0:59:09| I would recommend they have four hours by December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| We will make them aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| I believe one thing that a couple of items that are not on our list yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| are the presentation by Dr. Buchanan last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| and then tomorrow will be another presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| so that will give each commissioner another hour or hour and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| so that all of them except Commissioner Johnson will be at or above the four hours after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3569)|
| 0:59:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| Well, if anyone needs any special care, and it's important to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3577)|
| 0:59:43| I would recommend you try to make arrangements to get their training done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| and if you need any help, call my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| We can see what we can do to try to help get them some training before the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| I'm not volunteering us to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| but I'm saying we might be able to find somewhere where they can get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| If I recall, too, it's also a responsibility of this commission to see that it's funded for their training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3603)|
| 1:00:09| if I recall the resolution correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| So if we need to do something in a hurry, just contact us on behalf of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3611)|
| 1:00:18| We'll see what we can arrange to help expedite someone if they're in a real tenuous situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| I'd hate for someone who is very valuable to your commission to be put in a tenable situation when it's not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3624)|
| 1:00:33| I appreciate that, and we'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| Is there a light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| From the language I just heard, it seems like there could be a real problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| if you're somebody that gets appointed by necessity in October, November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| and you have to have your four hours in by December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| No, it's a year from their initial appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| But all these people have been appointed, and the April ticket was running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| That gives us this case a little bit of ambiguity, which we normally wouldn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| If they got appointed in December, they don't have to have four hours by December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| but they'll have to have four hours completely between January and December of the following year to comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3670)|
| 1:01:18| Thereafter, on their anniversary date at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| Yes, from thereafter, every December, every commissioner should have four hours to report to the secretary of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3680)|
| 1:01:27| I believe is the way it's worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| I just wanted to compliment Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| He attended the CTAS class that I did on zoning, and, of course, he could have probably taught the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3696)|
| 1:01:43| So I thought that was great that you wanted to continue your education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| even though you're the director of the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| I was very impressed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| I do feel it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| The laws change, and we, the staff, have a responsibility to keep up with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| and new techniques, so I enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| No further lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| The next item is added to the agenda, discussion regarding the joint education committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3728)|
| 1:02:16| This is the added discussion item in front of 49, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| And the reason I'd ask for it to go in front of 49, because it's about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| as we discussed, as Brad pointed out last month, that the joint education committee met in October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3747)|
| 1:02:35| and talked a little bit about several things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| and that included some kind of common ground that we can discuss with our state delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3758)|
| 1:02:45| And so the November meeting really kind of flushed that out a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3765)|
| 1:02:52| And as we looked at, you know, the board has their legislative priorities as it relates to education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3772)|
| 1:03:01| and what we kind of honed in on is, you know, there's more that unites us than divides us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3781)|
| 1:03:09| And what are the core things we feel that the joint committee can talk about when we get to item 49?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3789)|
| 1:03:18| And so we didn't decide on anything, but basically what we covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3798)|
| 1:03:24| and what we're going to put together and present to both bodies is, as we discovered last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3804)|
| 1:03:34| Dr. Lyons' funding for public education, BP 2.0,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| we think that that's something that we can both get behind as it relates to how our schools are funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3819)|
| 1:03:47| In addition to school vouchers, and we feel that that's something, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3827)|
| 1:03:54| and we would need to get into that a little deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| But first, I'm going to go back up to BEP 2.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| That's, you know, we probably ask for that every year, but what we discussed this time was trying to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3841)|
| 1:04:08| if we could find a few elements that we could maybe help them push,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| more than likely, you know, they're not going to pass 2.0 as it sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| So what elements can we potentially try to get some common ground amongst the rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3857)|
| 1:04:23| and the urban legislators to move that forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3863)|
| 1:04:31| Again, this is, you know, the whole thing of channeling dollars into private schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3871)|
| 1:04:38| We think that, you know, that's not needed, especially not in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3878)|
| 1:04:47| There's a, for those of you all that don't know, as it relates to charter schools, if they apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3887)|
| 1:04:56| even if the local boards or local legislations say no, if the application is proper, the state is going to say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3896)|
| 1:05:05| So that's, you know, bringing government as close as we can to the local level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| we feel it's something that we can gather around and unite on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| And that was one thing, trying to bring that final authority closer to our homes, which means our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3915)|
| 1:05:25| And we talked a lot about that and about, you know, right now there's several charter schools out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3925)|
| 1:05:34| not in Knox County, that really didn't even have their own community support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3934)|
| 1:05:38| You know, they're coming, and the community didn't ask for them, doesn't necessarily want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| But if the application is proper, here they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| So if we can't change those shoulds to shalls in terms of everything we've done here locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3946)|
| 1:05:53| at least we can push for a community support element that says if greater than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3953)|
| 1:06:00| if less than this percent of your people don't want the school, that has to weigh in the application process somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3960)|
| 1:06:08| So, again, charter schools aren't a big, huge monster right now, as they are in some districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3968)|
| 1:06:17| But, you know, we kind of have our first large-scale charter school that has support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| but there are probably others that are coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| And that was really it in terms of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3987)|
| 1:06:35| And we also had some questions about, you know, some folks at the state would like to pull the pre-K funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=3995)|
| 1:06:49| We're not saying that that's something that we'll just say keep pre-K,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| but one thing that we asked them to do was to, because we have a couple of schools that's been at pre-K a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4012)|
| 1:07:01| you know, Sammy Hill, Fair Garden, what are some, what's the statistics of those longer-serving pre-K?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4021)|
| 1:07:10| So they're going to pull those numbers and try to give us a basis to say, you know, this is something that we can get behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4030)|
| 1:07:17| And then there was a lot of talk about kind of the testing and graduation rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4037)|
| 1:07:23| And I don't want to sit, I don't want to confuse the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| but right now there's a formula by which graduations count either for you or against you, and it can be limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4046)|
| 1:07:37| And there's some legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| I'll look to Russ or someone that talks about when the ACT is given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4059)|
| 1:07:46| There's like a five-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| You all are looking confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| Well, if you don't know, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| But there was talk about how we count our graduation rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| This came from, I think, Board Member Bounds talked a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4078)|
| 1:08:05| So I'll bring you more on that next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| I'll pull that string because, again, like Russ, I didn't fully understand it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| But those were the items that we talked about, primarily legislative priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4092)|
| 1:08:17| And so if those are some things we could get behind, we don't have to make a decision today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| In fact, we're going to end up with a resolution that kind of comes before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| But as we talk about us meeting with our state delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| just try to think of some things that we can be a strong united front that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| hey, this is what we want you all to champion this legislative year as it relates to education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4118)|
| 1:08:47| in particular education in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| Madam Clerk, read the next discussion item, and then we'll tie these two together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| Discussion regarding the Knox County Legislative Joint Meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| Let me open the discussion here by saying Commissioner McKenzie just presented to us some of the content| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4146)|
| 1:09:15| that the Board of Education or Commission might like to see discussed with the legislative delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4155)|
| 1:09:23| Now then, let me talk a moment to process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| The chair of the Knox County Legislative Delegation, Representative Eddie Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4166)|
| 1:09:34| has proposed that there be a meeting early in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| Time and place has been emailed to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4178)|
| 1:09:44| The process to be used is he's asking us, Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| to have a couple of items that we would like to see legislative input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4190)|
| 1:09:57| We would like to give our legislative input to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| A couple of items lasting approximately 15 minutes per item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4201)|
| 1:10:07| and also see the Board of Education, which will be in that same joint meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| Commission and the Board of Education, with the local Knox County Legislative Delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4211)|
| 1:10:19| that the Board of Education also have two items of approximately 15 minutes of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4219)|
| 1:10:26| so that we could have at that one meeting possibly four items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4226)|
| 1:10:33| that we here in Knox County would see to be of importance that we express our opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4233)|
| 1:10:40| to the state representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| That's the process he's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| I'm saying we need to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| Commissioner Schoonmaker, I think your light was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| Well, I would just, hopefully we can, this may help out a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| As you know, last month I attended the annual meeting of the Tennessee County Services Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4258)|
| 1:11:04| and I signed up to be on their governmental relations committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| So I have, if you'll pass those down, the platform for 2016 for the governing body of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4268)|
| 1:11:17| county mayors, county commissioners, and county road superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| So this may give you just an overview of what they're thinking about before our December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4281)|
| 1:11:28| Commissioner Thomas, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| Yes, just quickly, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| I think this is a great opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| This meeting is going to be December 17th, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| Often or several times I've seen some resolution come before us to vote on in support of something in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4299)|
| 1:11:49| But this is, I think, a real opportunity to really get your voice heard instead of us just passing resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4309)|
| 1:11:58| So I hope that we'll all participate and all be there with some of the things that you feel are necessary for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4318)|
| 1:12:09| And one of those, like today, we were at the Metropolitan Drug Commission's legislative meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4329)|
| 1:12:15| about the drug problem we have here in Knox County and all across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| Items like that, things that are going to affect people's lives every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| we need to have some of these things ready to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| One of the things that I would like to add to the mix, and this may seem insignificant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4355)|
| 1:12:42| and I'm going to put together a packet of materials and send it around to everyone so you'll have more information on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4362)|
| 1:12:50| But last session, the legislature did not choose to continue funding the Tennessee Economic Council on Women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4370)|
| 1:12:59| We discussed that as a commission, sent them a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| And from the people I've talked to, it looks like they recognize that that might have been a mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| and it's going to be coming back up in this next session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| Otherwise, this organization will sunset in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| So as we talk about what issues to discuss with our legislative delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| I would like for that to be one, that we encourage them to encourage the continued funding of the TECW.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4403)|
| 1:13:32| And as I said, I will send around more information on that so that you can be fully prepped about what exactly this organization does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4412)|
| 1:13:41| how it's comprised, how people are appointed to it, and what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| They're really the only group in the entire state doing this kind of research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4426)|
| 1:13:52| And although it says it's called the Tennessee Economic Council on Women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| the work that they do affects every single citizen of the state, regardless of gender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4436)|
| 1:14:03| And as I said, they're doing research and studies that no one else in the state is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4443)|
| 1:14:10| and it turns out that it's tremendously valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| So that's something I'd just like to throw into the mix, and I will get you all some more information on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4454)|
| 1:14:20| They just came out with their most recent research study, and it's absolutely fascinating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4460)|
| 1:14:30| So there will be more information coming out about that too, and I'll make sure that every one of you gets it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4470)|
| 1:14:37| Thank you, Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Of the discussion items tonight, then the only discussion item to be carried forward is the items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4478)|
| 1:14:45| and format of this legislative delegation meeting to be discussed this coming Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4485)|
| 1:14:54| Are there seeing no lights, do any of the commissioners present wish to make any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4494)|
| 1:15:06| Okay, I'll burn the rest of this 15th minute, Madam Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| We went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| So we're over, so we're over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| The 6th Annual Gibbs Christmas Parade, the 6th Annual Gibbs Christmas Parade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4517)|
| 1:15:24| because the Halls Christmas Parade is stopped this year due to construction of the Highway 33| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4524)|
| 1:15:33| or Maryville Highway and Halls, Sunday, December the 6th at 2.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4533)|
| 1:15:40| there will be the 6th Annual Gibbs Christmas Parade starting at the Gibbs High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4540)|
| 1:15:47| and ending at Clear Springs Baptist Church, new construction site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4547)|
| 1:15:56| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| No, you can go ahead and finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| You've got to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| We're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| I just thought about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| I wanted to thank Barry's Funeral Home for taking care of the four homeless veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4567)|
| 1:16:15| I had the privilege of attending that funeral, and it was done just perfect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4575)|
| 1:16:23| and they took care of everything, and I just want to commend them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| and thank them for doing that and for taking care of those four veterans that deserved that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4587)|
| 1:16:37| and it was done very respectfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| So I just want to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| It was four veterans of the four branches of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| Four branches of service, and so they had no family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| but this community took them in, and Barry's took care of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4610)|
| 1:16:56| If there be nothing further to come before commission, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151109?start=4616)|
