| 0:00:52| Commissioner Lutho? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=52)|
| 0:00:54| Commissioner Briggs? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=54)|
| 0:00:56| Commissioner Anders? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=56)|
| 0:00:57| Commissioner Lambert? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=57)|
| 0:00:59| Commissioner Smith? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=59)|
| 0:01:01| Commissioner Carringer? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=61)|

| 0:01:06| Commissioner Brown? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| Commissioner Pinkston? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=67)|
| 0:01:09| We have 16 commissioners that are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=69)|
| 0:01:35| I want to turn it over to our new law director, Joe Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=95)|
| 0:01:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=102)|
| 0:01:44| Sir, I believe it's appropriate before we go any further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| if there's any commissioner who feels she or he has a conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| as you know under our rules of procedure and ethics code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=111)|
| 0:01:53| if you feel you have a conflict that you can't fairly and partially sit in this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=113)|
| 0:01:58| you are not only to recuse yourselves, you likewise have a duty to leave the proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| You will not participate in any discussions, deliberations, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| So I'll defer to the chairman, sir, to see if anyone here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=126)|
| 0:02:09| any commission president wishes to assert a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| I'll recuse in conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| I'm recusing for a conflict of interest that I did not serve on commission at the time that any of this took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=139)|
| 0:02:29| Commissioner Carringer, I'm not sure that's a relevant conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| A number of persons have not served on commission at the time various steps of this have not taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| So you can recuse for other reasons, but I'm not sure that's particularly relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=159)|
| 0:02:46| Again, we have a certain set of prescribed rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| I think the key is whether or not the commissioner feels she can be fair and impartial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| whether or not she feels she can come here without a preconceived notion in terms of whether or not Mr. Moore should remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=174)|
| 0:03:02| But if the commissioner feels, for whatever reason, that she can't be fair and impartial, then recusal would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=182)|
| 0:03:10| Because, again, you're not going to find black let alone every single incident of recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=190)|
| 0:03:18| So, Commissioner, I'll have to defer to you through the chairman whether or not you feel you can objectively listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| and be fair and impartial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| Therefore, that's why I'm going to recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| Mr. Law Director, as we go through this process of who's here, who's not here, who's recused themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=215)|
| 0:03:45| could you reiterate the state law of what constitutes a quorum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| Well, according to your rules, a quorum is a quorum of the commission as compared to commissioners present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| So it would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| Well, it's not just present, but state law states that an absence does not change the quorum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| but a vacancy or a recusal does change a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| So how many recusals do we have at this point and what's going to constitute a quorum at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=250)|
| 0:04:21| How many recusals do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| Right now we just have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| I want to recuse myself for conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| Ivan Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| We have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| Lumpy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Lumpy hasn't said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| No, Lumpy is absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| I saw him walk in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| Commissioner Lutho, were you saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| Well, I'm just trying to get to where everybody understands what state law is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=286)|
| 0:04:54| and what's going to constitute a quorum and what's a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=294)|
| 0:05:01| And we need to keep that in, you know, we need to know what that is as we proceed forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=301)|
| 0:05:08| Is that not correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| I believe, though, that Commissioner Pinkson wishes to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| I was involved in this lawsuit, so I feel like I need to, as a co-defendant, I need to recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=316)|
| 0:05:24| And as I have the floor, I don't feel like, you know, if I'm going to be called as a witness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=324)|
| 0:05:33| then I cannot sit here as both a judge and jury and be a witness as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=333)|
| 0:05:41| In fact, if I'm going to be called as a witness, then I'm going to have to recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| I don't think our law director has yet ruled on the question as to whether city commissioners can be both witnesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| and arbiters of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| Like I said, if I'm going to be called as a witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| And so perhaps it would be appropriate now for our law director to rule on that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| because if he rules on that question that commissioners should not be both arbiters of fact and witnesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=362)|
| 0:06:10| then your reason for recusal will disappear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| So that's why I'm going to ask you not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| Well, I've not recused yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| I'm just saying if I'm going to be called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| If he were, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| If I'm going to be asked to be a witness, then I can't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| Well, when the appropriate time is to ask the law director that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| Could you go ahead and answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| I will approach it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| Neither side can compel testimony because of the nature of this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| The problem you have is this is under a state statute that provides no guidance whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| It has not been opined upon by our courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| It hasn't been analyzed by the legislature, nor has it been opined upon by the state attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| Because this is not a 202H hearing where you can compel witnesses to subpoena testimony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| the commissioner is called as a witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| She or he need not testify, but you can't do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| If you are inclined to testify, then you cannot likewise run down to the podium, testify, run back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| and then sit in judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| So that's the dilemma you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| It's an imperfect system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| There is, you know, essentially that's the hand you've been dealt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| You're quasi-judicial, albeit you don't fall under the rules of civil procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| and the legislature has not thought it through to its logical conclusion to provide you with rules of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=432)|
| 0:07:20| Commissioner Bowles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| If I'm understanding or remembering correctly from the last commission meeting when we voted on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=444)|
| 0:07:30| Commissioner Lambert and Commissioner Smith both recused themselves at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| and Mr. Jarrett indicated that recusal from that vote indicated that would also count as a recusal during the procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=454)|
| 0:07:46| that they would not be allowed to participate or to deliberate or be part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| So does that automatically count, Mr. Jarrett, as a recusal for purposes here, or how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=472)|
| 0:08:01| Well, Commissioner Lambert stated early on that he was recusing himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| If Commissioner Lambert appears as a witness, then he's doing so as a private citizen but not a member of the deliberative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| I'm just wondering whether his absence counts as an absence or a recusal for purposes of determining the quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=492)|
| 0:08:19| He did intimate during the hearing and in the media that he was recusing himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| That's the best I can tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| He didn't specifically confide in me or approach me and say I am formally recusing myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| Point of order on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| So, I mean, I think we're going to have to count or not count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| So it sounds like every other commissioner showed up, presented themselves present, and then recused himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=517)|
| 0:08:45| You know, his self or her self.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| So it would seem to me for the purposes of today that that would be the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| If I'm wrong, please say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| We count him as a recusal or as an absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| So the question is, is he a recusal or is he an absence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| Because it may change the quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| Well, it's my understanding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| I think it will still take eight, but it needs to be precise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| My understanding was he was recusing himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| So that recusal goes over to this particular meeting also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| Yes, sir, because he intimated that he was close personal friends with Mr. Moore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| and he didn't feel he could sit in judgment of him is the last thing I believe he said on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| So we have five recusals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| That would be 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| So eight is the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| Do you have something further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| Well, sir, before we, I think, go into the procedures, as you can imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| Mr. Moore called my office to discuss his case, which is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| He didn't solicit legal advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| I didn't impart legal advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| But when you have someone who's pro se, when we have a case like this, either codes or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| either the attorney is going to call or the pro se person is going to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| And so we discussed what I believe the commission will follow as rules of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| We likewise discussed whether or not he thought there were possible grounds to seek a continuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=613)|
| 0:10:20| I think before we proceed, we should hear from Mr. Moore to see, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| if he wants to proceed today or seek a continuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| And once we can dispense with that, then you can make a determination how you want to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| Mr. Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| Scott Moore, 5307 Taunton Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| I had a conversation with Mr. Jarrett concerning the statute that was sent to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=640)|
| 0:10:48| and I'm not sure I have it here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| It says that I should be notified in writing of the charge other than calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| I did receive a letter, and I just got it and I really haven't went over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| I got it yesterday afternoon from the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| I had received something earlier, about a week ago, that says that you're having a meeting here to remove me for calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=665)|
| 0:11:13| Now, that was one issue I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| The other issue is that back during the Sunshine trial, half of you were here and half of you were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| But even for us to have to sign a letter to have a special call meeting was deemed to be a violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=681)|
| 0:11:30| because it was done outside of the public's eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| I get a copy of these rules that the commission have not voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=694)|
| 0:11:41| I think it's on Chairman Strickland's letterhead, but I'm still unsure of when the commission adopted these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=701)|
| 0:11:49| I see that I think they're going to be adopted this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| but I think you can see that that's kind of as a problem for me because I was straightforward early on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=712)|
| 0:11:59| with the commissioner, Chairman Strickland, and Mr. Jarrett, that we probably needed somewhere around eight hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| eight and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| And I get something saying we're going to have 15 minutes opening and an hour to argue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| And I submit to you that that's not due process, that we need some time to be able to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=732)|
| 0:12:20| and put on a case that for a lot of you were not even here on January 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| And we've called witnesses, and I'm assuming that all of the people who we issued subpoenas to are prepared to testify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=746)|
| 0:12:36| Because on the bottom of it, we had please contact me at this number before Thursday at 430 or 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| I'm not sure what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| And I haven't received a call from anyone, so I'm assuming that everyone's going to be prepared to testify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=765)|
| 0:12:53| If that's the case, then there's a number of you all that won't be able to sit there, according to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=773)|
| 0:13:01| And there's some other issues concerning some things being faxed out through the commission office, I think, concerning this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=781)|
| 0:13:12| I think it comes from Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| Once again, something done outside of the public's eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| We have looked, and maybe they can respond to it, that they have meetings at the Time Warp Tea Room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| Public notice, but I think the law director or the former law director had sent us a letter early on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| that those meetings should have minutes to them and who are present at those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| And if Commissioner Harmon can produce those to us so we can see if this matter was discussed at one of their meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=817)|
| 0:13:46| it may help us better understand while we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| I'd be happy to respond if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| Well, if you'll let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| But for today, I think it would be best for the commission to come up with a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| because I'm asking the commission that I need more time than an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| And, you know, I've talked to Mr. Jarrett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| and we've got records that we need to get that only he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| And I think we both agreed that I don't need to waste his time or his staff's time going through boxes after boxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| after boxes of lawsuit depositions until we know what the ground rules are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=861)|
| 0:14:31| So maybe Mr. Jarrett can respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=871)|
| 0:14:38| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, first of all, Mr. Moore, multiple issues you've raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| I'm going to try to, in my mind, see if I have a mental calculus to do these one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| But in terms of the formal charges, I'm of the opinion that the law was complied with on March 23, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=887)|
| 0:14:57| Commissioner Craig Lutehold, as vice chairman, sent you a letter that I think comports with Tennessee law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| outlining for you the charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| And likewise, I followed up with a letter reiterating that on April 16, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| And likewise, sent you some information several days ago, albeit by e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| I understand now you were out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| In terms of the process, if you recall, during the commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| I believe you called during the commission meeting and asked for the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| So that was your request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| Now, again, we realize it's a complex issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| But in terms of the procedure, no, the commission did not formally adopt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| You were advised of the commission procedure the same day the commissioners were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| So in terms of unfair advantage, both sides were aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| Now, the commission can basically obviate that technicality this morning just by suspending its rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=944)|
| 0:15:51| wherein people technically only get five minutes and enlarge it to 90 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| But I think the more important issue is, I don't want to speak for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| but it sounds like you're seeking a continuance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| and I want to make sure that that's on the record before we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| Are there any other grounds you wanted to bring before the commission before we proceed with some of these other issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=965)|
| 0:16:14| I don't know that there are issues that need to be addressed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| I mean, I talked about so many, and I left the other paper at home because I was under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=979)|
| 0:16:27| I thought the commission would probably grant a continuance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| I think they don't have a process in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| I think if we go back for the ones that's been here, we tried to do this hearing for the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=995)|
| 0:16:42| and we got boggled down with process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| And as I've lived across the state, I haven't seen anyone that used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1005)|
| 0:16:52| that have gone to this extreme to remove someone from office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| So there is no guidelines out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| This is a new process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| And I think we need to be open and transparent, and there's no need to move quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| If there's a problem with the commission that doesn't want me to sit on the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| I will submit to you today that I won't show up at the BZA this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| so there will be no issue that I could possibly take a vote on something on the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| But I think it's, to be fair to me, that I have a right to due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1040)|
| 0:17:28| You know, even back a few months ago when the ethics committee did it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| it involved Mr. Walls and the administration, that each side probably took four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| five, six hours apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| And this is going to be a complicated case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| And I think that some of you all will try to shut me down when we just talk about the removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| But there's a lot more to it than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| Now, I hear people, Commissioner Briggs, say the high burden of proof to remove an official is high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1072)|
| 0:17:59| And that's just not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| I was sued by a criminal defense attorney in a civil court where it's a preponderance of evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| It's just the judge's feeling or a tip of the scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| The burden is very weak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| You know, if you go to a criminal case, then you've got to have a beyond a reasonable doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| And the burden would be high at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| Point of order on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| The standard that was used in Mr. Moore's case was not preponderance of the evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| It was clear and convincing evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| That's in the last paragraph of the ruling, and that ruling I have put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| and that particular paragraph I have put on the commission website, and it's been there for nearly a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| Speaking of legalities, Mr. Moore, your attorney contacted me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| and advised that he filed a petition to the Tennessee Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| Can you verify that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| Yes, I was going to bring that up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| We have filed an appeal to the Tennessee Supreme Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| and we've asked for it to be expedited since it is an ouster case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| And I think, and I'm not a lawyer, but I think when you have a proceeding headed into a courtroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| that the civil or other proceedings would take second seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| Because I think there would be a lot of things that I wouldn't be able to say because we have that case pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| and I don't want to jeopardize the case or do something to that case here at a county commission hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1157)|
| 0:19:29| So I think those are a couple of grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| I also have one other thing, and I don't know that we need to address it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| but there's four commissioners, and they all sit right here together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| that was on the front page of the Knoxville News Sentinel that said they were ready to vote me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| And you are a quasi-judicial committee today, and I think to be fair to anyone sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1186)|
| 0:19:53| if it's me or if it's a citizen or if it's one of you, that you have a right to a fair hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1193)|
| 0:20:00| and that you all should have open minds and not come in here with a predetermined notion of what you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1200)|
| 0:20:09| So I'm concerned about that, that it seems, of what the paper said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| that they have predetermined the outcome of their vote already before we even start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1215)|
| 0:20:22| And, you know, just because they sit together made it a little more troubling to myself, but that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1222)|
| 0:20:31| I don't know if the law director or who, we need to take that up at some point, but that's a concern of mine too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| Because all I'm asking for is a fair hearing on the facts, and then you all can decide what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1238)|
| 0:20:48| But the most important thing this morning, I think, is that we've got an appeal to the Supreme Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| we've asked for it to be expedited, and that we haven't been able really to prepare a case for today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1253)|
| 0:21:00| because we really didn't know the ground rules of how we're going to proceed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1260)|
| 0:21:07| Somebody came up with these rules, and I'm not sure who it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| I'm assuming it's Chairman Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| But there's a lot more of you than one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| Each of you all have one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| And I would hope that someone on there would at least give me the opportunity to be able to put on a case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| that's going to take more than an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| I mean, I think, you know, I told Chairman Strickland and Mr. Jarrett that I thought it was important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| The first thing we need to look at is the January 31st meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| And that's three and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| And then I think we've called 10 or 11 witnesses, and I've read through depositions, and it's about 30 minutes apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1298)|
| 0:21:45| Now, we may be able to speed that up, but for a lot of you all, you wasn't here for January 31st meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| and the only part of January 31st meeting that you're aware of is probably based on what you've either read in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1311)|
| 0:21:58| New Sentinel or other media outlets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| And I'd submit to you that maybe looking at the actual tape would help you more than an article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| or something that got in your mind in a 60-second clip or a two-minute read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| So those are some of the issues, and I respectfully ask that, you know, we postpone the hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1333)|
| 0:22:20| but we go ahead and we can get a process down that we all know the ground rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| and I think it goes quicker that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| Because if not, I think we're going to stumble over each other as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| I think it makes it more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| Director Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Mr. Moore, just so you're aware, and I did speak to you about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| I understand that you did send out a document you entitled to subpoena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| You realize that you lack subpoena power, as does the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| Neither side can compel witnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| So I'm making light of that, but it doesn't have the legal effect I think you were hoping it would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| In terms of the continuance commissioners, of course, you know, in terms from my perspective, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| I'm here to submit to the wisdom of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| I'm prepared to move forward in terms of the legal aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| As a quasi-judicial body, what a court would do were to analyze this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| it would say essentially, one, that continuance is normally liberally granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| unless the side that it's being requested of can show a manifest prejudice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| So if the commission feels it will be prejudiced today by not moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| then a continuance wouldn't be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| If, however, the commission feels it would not be prejudiced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| and it would be more appropriate to do this at a later date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| and finalize this rules of procedure in a different manner than that which they're present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| But, again, this is a commission decision as to whether or not it wants to proceed today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| or grant the continuance requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Yes, I have just a couple of comments to make about what's been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| I don't think we're here to retry the perjury case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| That's already been tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| That's part of the court documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| That's been decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| The sole thing that we need to decide on a hearing whether to remove Mr. Moore from a committee or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1445)|
| 0:24:13| is whether if a person, if an elected official has been ousted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| and sits on a committee by virtue of his position, should he be removed from that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| That's all we're trying to decide to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| I think that, you know, you referred to the part of the same hearings that we had regarding the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| and some of the things that occurred there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| There's a big difference between this commission moving someone from a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| and having an ouster of an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| I mean, quite frankly, and this is, and I believe that Mr. Jarrett would agree with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| is that the people that sit on the committees that are appointed by this commission serve at the pleasure of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| And if there's cause to remove them, we have a hearing like this to determine if there has been a cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| and then to vote to see if we want to remove someone from the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| We don't have the same, the bar is not so high as it is to remove an elected official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1500)|
| 0:25:06| which really can only be done by a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| And just also so you know, when we voted, I think it was about two months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1510)|
| 0:25:17| whether if an elected official is ousted, he is removed from all county committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| I made an amendment to exclude you from that because I thought it was more important to look ahead than looking behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1521)|
| 0:25:27| So I don't want you to think that we came into this, that I came into this with any prejudice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| because I added an amendment to that that would exclude you from any, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| from that resolution if it did become, that ordinance did pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| Finally, I'm going to, I do have a comment and I think that this commission needs to consider this seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1541)|
| 0:25:51| is this appeal that's been made to the Tennessee Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| If we go through this, let me make one other comment about the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| We set the rules on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| Since it's not codified in state law, we set the rules on how we want to conduct this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| The final thing is that deals with this request for a continuance, and this is a concern that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1570)|
| 0:26:18| What would we do or what would happen if this does go before the Tennessee Supreme Court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1578)|
| 0:26:25| They do act on this in an expeditious manner and the original decision and the appeals court's decision is overturned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1585)|
| 0:26:36| And Scott takes his seat back on the commission and we've ousted him from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1596)|
| 0:26:43| we've removed him, it's not an ouster, we've removed him from this commission, this committee, the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1603)|
| 0:26:51| And now we found out that the Supreme Court's ruled that he didn't do anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| Well, there's a simple answer to that, if I may, Mr. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| And I think that's something that we need to, we really need to consider, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| particularly with Mr. Moore's request for a continuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| Do we need to postpone our judgment on this until we're absolutely certain that his appeals process has been exhausted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1630)|
| 0:27:19| Because I think we would, you know, I think we would potentially have a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| if the Tennessee Supreme Court overturns these lower court rulings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1644)|
| 0:27:30| Mr. Chairman, may I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| Commissioner Briggs raises an interesting point, but there's a simple answer to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| And that is that in the highly unlikely event that this case is heard, it's already been decided at a civil court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| there's binding law, it's already been rejected by unanimous appeals court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| But in the highly unlikely event that the Supreme Court took it and reversed all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| and Mr. Moore would resume the status of a commissioner, commissioners can't serve on Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| So the point of our removal of him becomes moot because he couldn't serve anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| So it really is such a moot point that we can proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1681)|
| 0:28:09| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| I want to ask for a continuance until, make a motion we continue this until the Supreme Court makes a ruling on Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1692)|
| 0:28:19| I'm going to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| I'm going to second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| I would like to speak to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| I would like to speak to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Go ahead, Mr. Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| It has, Commissioner Moore, former Commissioner Moore keeps representing January 31st, 2000 as an important date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1711)|
| 0:28:41| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| As Commissioner Briggs said, that's a matter of decided law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| The court ruled on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| We have a binding ruling not overturned by anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| In fact, already challenged once and turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| It has been, the relevant date is October 14th, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| That was the date that in a civil case, Commissioner Moore was found by a standard of clear and convincing evidence to have given false statements under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1743)|
| 0:29:17| That's all of what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| It's not about other people's behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| It's not about what happened at the meeting that he was convicted of lying about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| It's only about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| And the question before us is, does that, which is still binding law, meet the standard that our law director laid out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| And he laid out the following standard for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| Failure to perform the duty imposed upon him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| We can agree or disagree about that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| But the next one is clearly, or, or, so any one of these standards can invalidate, brings discredit upon the appointed authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1785)|
| 0:29:53| How can we argue that someone found guilty, found in a court to have lied under oath, does not bring discredit to the authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| Engages in wrongdoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| How can we as a body find or delay even when engages in wrongdoing by giving false testimony under oath?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1802)|
| 0:30:10| Or failure to establish, fail to adhere to established laws, rules, and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| Clearly, giving false testimony under oath meets that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| So the four criteria, any one of which, under our law director's definition, is justification for removal of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1818)|
| 0:30:25| there's an almost prima facie case on its face for removal of three of those four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| This decision, the initial finding that Scott Moore lied under oath, was made 553 days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1832)|
| 0:30:41| And the appeals court, 54 days ago, said it was a valid ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1841)|
| 0:30:48| Now suddenly we get a last minute Supreme Court appeal and we're all going to scurry and scamper and go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| We have reason to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| And even in the unlikely situation that we're all wrong and this gets overturned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| he still can't serve on board of zoning appeals because he then resumes the role of a position where you can't be appointed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| So our actions, that point is moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| And we should go forward today and we should hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| Commissioner Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| I frankly feel the only equitable thing to do is go along with the motion of my colleagues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| But let me ask the time frame question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| If I'm not mistaken, former Commissioner Moore, now BZA member Moore's term on the BZA expires in like August, doesn't it, or September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1887)|
| 0:31:38| We know, I'm thinking about this, the term limit, the Bailey case, didn't it take three years to find its way to the Supreme Court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1898)|
| 0:31:44| I guess my point is, does this become moot, Mr. Jarrett, if they hear it in August of 2012?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| Well, if it runs its course, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| Then after Mr. Moore's term on BZA expires, we aren't really, this is, I'm not trying to put words in your mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1914)|
| 0:32:03| but what's its status in the legal world?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| Well, that's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| It becomes a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| I mean, if he's, if the appeal for some reason, you know, the court, normally what they'll do is they'll either send back an order quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1928)|
| 0:32:15| that says permission to appeal granted, file your brief, or they'll say we're not interested and we'll affirm the lower court judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1935)|
| 0:32:23| But if it goes beyond the date of his service, then it is a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| We have a motion on the floor for content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| Mr. Chairman, down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| I just had one thing that I think that may help if I talk about it just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| They talk about that I was found to have lied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| The final judgment on that isn't here yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| I can say that the Court of Appeals ruled that the trial court erred a couple of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| but they're saying we didn't argue the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| We have those points in record, in our briefs, and they're, you know, we've sent them to the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1979)|
| 0:33:06| You know, I think that's important to realize that this case isn't over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| I haven't been found guilty of anything yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| And I think about Commissioner Harmon says no harm is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| If I was to take my seat back on the commission, it would be a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| It certainly isn't a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| You don't get paid for being on BZA, but certainly my reputation once again is on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| And if I'm removed and then was to be put back, even though it's a moot point, I was removed by this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| and it's another hit on my reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| And I will submit to you today that I protected this county for 14 years in the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| And I have not had one speeding ticket in my whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| Now, I will tell you I got a couple of those red light camera tickets on Broadway turning off 640 on the Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| I don't do it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| I just sit there until the light turns green now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| I've never been sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| I wasn't sued any time I was at the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| And you're making arrests continuously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| I was never sued while I worked in the jail for four years with our inmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| And I think that speaks something that I've never been sued, never had a ticket, never been in trouble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| and no one in my family has ever been in trouble and arrested or anything until I ran for county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| And we're prepared to bring a person up here that talked to some attorneys that was involved in the case that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2069)|
| 0:34:37| well, we didn't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| We wasn't interested in the other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| So I don't want to get into the case and my things today, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| I'm just asking that at least we get a continuance to whatever you all want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| if it's for a month until we can get the stuff or if it's until this Supreme Court hearing is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2091)|
| 0:34:57| So thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| Mr. Jarrett, back to the Supreme Court appeals process, before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| do you have any idea how long it is before it's even before them to say, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2108)|
| 0:35:16| we will proceed with this or, no, we won't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| I couldn't give you a time frame, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| I know that the pleadings, according to Mr. Moore's attorney, they're presently with the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| The court will generally, you know, except when you're talking about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| a death case appeal or something of a high capital crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| the court does take very seriously ouster because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| a person is put in office by the electorate, so they'll expedite it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| I couldn't give you a time frame on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| So there's no likelihood that this would even be seen in a decision made whether to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2143)|
| 0:35:51| before Mr. Moore's term expires?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| I can't imagine the court waiting 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| Normally what it will do, it's not going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| All the court would do is they would send him a one-page order to his attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| and either say one of two things, one, permission to appeal denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| or two, permission for oral argument granted, file your brief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| and then they'd get 30 days to file a brief with the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| So it's an ongoing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| So likely this letter would come forward within 90 days of the appeal process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2176)|
| 0:36:23| Yes, that's very feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| So when did the appeal process start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| I received a copy of the pleadings from Arthur Seymour, I'm thinking, about a week ago, if I recall, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2189)|
| 0:36:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| We've just heard statements that are at odds with the demonstrable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| Let me read once again from the John Kerry Blackwood ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| Chairman Moore's statements that he does not recall the subject matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| that it might have been about real estate and his other explanations, while under oath, were untrue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| These statements were false, given under oath, intentionally, knowingly, and with intent to deceive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| TCA 3617702 defines perjury as a false statement under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2228)|
| 0:37:15| This offense is a misdemeanor, involves moral turpitude, and is a violation of penal statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| Furthermore, there were some matters at the appeals level which said a trial court should have had a jury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2242)|
| 0:37:31| but that was irrelevant to the Scott Moore matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| And the judge said directly, we affirm the trial court's judgment as to Scott Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2253)|
| 0:37:40| So let us be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| Those violations are on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| They have not been overturned or questioned by any legal authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| They are a matter of pending, binding, existing law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| So, and they were, the first one was issued 553 days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| We are not premature in our action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| We are overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| Seeing no other likes, we have a motion on the floor for continuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2296)|

| 0:39:40| It specified that we hear from until the Supreme Court makes their ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| And we also heard testimony that it would be very likely that that's indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| No, I think what we heard was that the law director said it could be within 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| Could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| Could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| I'm speculating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| I'd like to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| I have just a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| I don't think we can discuss this until the vote has been announced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| The vote is nine yes, four no, and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| So Mr. Moore will get a continuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| Do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| Well, that was just what my question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| Do we need a majority of the absolute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| Do the recuses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| Yes, it takes eight votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| If I could, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Moore, I'm not going to try to tell you how to try your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| I know you have able counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| You confer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| But you have to understand there's a distinction between putting on a defense and putting on a counterclaim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| And, you know, I'm talking to you like I would talk to an attorney on either side who doesn't often practice before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| You're in the position where you need to raise your defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| And if you don't raise a defense and rely on a counterclaim, you're dooming yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2447)|
| 0:40:55| Now, again, you, I don't want to give you legal advice, confer with counsel, but understand that's how the process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| You're in a situation where you're there to defend yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| You know, a counterclaim may seem attractive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| but it doesn't rise to the level of offering a defense for which the commission can consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| Is that clear, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| We have something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| Commissioner Bluto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| Two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| Number one, can we vote on the rules of procedure today for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2486)|
| 0:41:34| And number two, why does January 31st have to be retried?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2494)|
| 0:41:41| I would like to see all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| I mean, it, in essence, doesn't have any bearing on what we're here for for this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2502)|
| 0:41:49| It's already been adjudicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| If I could, Mr. Chairman and members of the commission, I would be a lot more comfortable if you would put on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| add to the agenda for next Monday the rules of procedure so you can discuss it in open forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| and then you can make a determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| You can cogitate it between now and then whether or not you want to stick with the time allotted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| or enlarge it or contract it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| You've heard a request for an enlargement of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| but I would be a lot more comfortable procedurally if you put it on the agenda for Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| Regarding your question as to January 31st, that's what I was trying to intimate to Mr. Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| That's a counterclaim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| That's not a defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| And, again, it's a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| These are costly proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| And he has a right not to be misled thinking that a counterclaim constitutes a defense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| because he's setting himself up to fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| And, again, you want a fair and impartial open meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| And, again, that's what I would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| We do that with pro se defendants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| That's what courts do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| If someone's pro se and not represented by counsel, the court will give them some guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| But an attorney, to me, that's irrelevant, but, you know, Mr. Moore can segue it into his defense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| and you feel it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| It's up to you whether or not you want to weigh it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| and what weight you'll accord any testimony you receive from either the commission representative or Mr. Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2577)|
| 0:43:05| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| I just wanted to make a comment to Mike down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| You know, I think what he decides to use is his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| But he's got an opening statement and an hour to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| If he wants to spend his entire time on that, you know, that's his business, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| That's all he's got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| If we decide to accept these rules, you know, these rules of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2605)|
| 0:43:34| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| I think implied in this process Mr. Moore said or agreed that he wouldn't serve on the BZA until we take this back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2617)|
| 0:43:48| Is that your understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| Whatever the commission wants me to do, that's certainly fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| But I will, if I have the opportunity, well, I'll wait just a minute and let you all finish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| I think that was implied in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| I don't think that we can ask him not to sit on a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| He's representing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| He volunteered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| That's up to him whether or not he shows up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| We can't imply that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| I think he volunteered for May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| He still represents the 7th District and the 7th District deserves to be represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| And that's, I think, his decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| Commissioner, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| Just talking about the hour timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| Depending on what the commission ultimately does at some point in time, I think just as we do in any case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2673)|
| 0:44:40| and maybe the law director can help me here or at least advise, that this is building a record in case it was to go into Chantry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2680)|
| 0:44:49| And I think if we don't argue it now, they'll say, why didn't you argue it when you went before the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2689)|
| 0:44:56| So I think being able to argue a case that you ought to be able to have at least a little more than an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2696)|
| 0:45:03| Like I said, the ethics committee gave Mr. Walls five or six hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| It was a two-day hearing and the administration some other time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| And that's the only hearing that I ever remember having here in this county to try to get someone out of their job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2711)|
| 0:45:21| or out of off a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| So, you know, I think, again, due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| Just to be clear, Mr. Law Director, for if and when we ever come back to this setting for this cause, the number is eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2733)|
| 0:45:45| We have five commissioners that have recused themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| They can't necessarily come back after the appeal and say, well, now I want to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| Is that a true statement or a false statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| Well, once you recuse yourself, in order to reverse that position, the facts and circumstances would have to change substantially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2756)|
| 0:46:05| My advice to a client is once they recuse themselves, they're recused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| I think that sort of implied the ruling of Commissioner Lambert when he recused himself last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| That it carried on to this manner today and I would think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| Same here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| I just want to make sure that the Law Director was agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| A point of order, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| I contend that the position of granting a continuance is an act of the commission as a body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2788)|
| 0:46:37| not an act of the commission in its role as hearing this proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2797)|
| 0:46:43| So in hearing this proceeding, the Law Director was absolutely correct that a quorum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| that the majority would be set at, in this case, eight out of 14 present and deciding on the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2809)|
| 0:46:57| But granting a continuance is an action of the full commission and thus the majority should be ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| and therefore the action has not been granted because there were only nine votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| I'd have to disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| Well, that's why I'm putting it to the Law Director, not to Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| Well, I believe that the continuance is lawful and supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| But Mr. Moore has raised on the record for your consideration next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| I think you would be wise to or you're certainly empowered on Monday to consider his request for an enlargement of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2844)|
| 0:47:33| I don't think the decision should, I'm not comfortable you making that decision today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| He stated for the record, I can remind you on Monday, that he does want more time than the hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| and you can consider it then, you can formally adopt him, open session on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| Okay, so you're saying that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| Hold on, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| Are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| What is the appeals process from this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| We are a quasi-judicial body hearing this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| What is the appeals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| Well, he would have to file an action in chancery court and a court would have to make a determination as to whether or not it feels that he was properly removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2883)|
| 0:48:13| The problem you have, of course, is it's an oddity, again, because of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| It's not like he's an employee who's losing a property right interest or he's an elected official, he's an appointed official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| But the court could entertain the motion and then could review, most likely review the record to see how the proceedings were carried out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420scottmoore?start=2903)|
