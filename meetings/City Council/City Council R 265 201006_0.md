| 0:03:30| Okay, any items to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| Mayor, I have one. Yeah, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| I'd like to make a motion to postpone items 12E and 12G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=216)|
| 0:03:42| Those include areas where the hospitals reside and members of those hospitals can't be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=222)|
| 0:03:52| But I think their voice is important, particular to those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| So maybe a two-week postponement should be sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=241)|

| 0:04:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=251)|

| 0:04:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=268)|

| 0:06:27| Moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| Now it's time for my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| My mayor's report to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| I want to start with a very important issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| our efforts to serve the unsheltered in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| As you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| we have intentionally communicated very openly with the public and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| council about our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| But there is some misinformation circulating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| So first I want to start by saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| let us remember that the people we are talking about are real people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| their sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| Living unsheltered under an underpass in unsanitary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| unsafe conditions, and that this is not sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| The action that the city will take this week is focused on cleaning the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| homeless encampment under and around I-40 interchange with I-275,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| an area commonly known as Blackstock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| Since March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| the number of individuals camping at this location has grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| There are approximately 100 people who are experiencing unsheltered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| homelessness in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| I visited Blackstock today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| along with my deputies and some of our outreach partners who engage every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| day with our neighbors experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| I want to first make sure everybody knows that there are no reports of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| any children staying in this encampment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| Street outreach workers from VMC, CARM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| and CAC say that physical distancing is not being observed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=464)|
| 0:07:51| Another really clear thing that our outreach workers were sharing with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| today and the community members that we met in the encampments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| everyone is increasingly concerned about unmitigated drug use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| Health and sanitation concerns have become much more pronounced since our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| visit to the encampment earlier this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| Additionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| nearly every person living in the area with whom we spoke made reference to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| crime and safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| They reported increased gunfire, rape, assault,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| crimes they say are often not being reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| This experience aligns unfortunately with the data we do have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| that since March there have been over 50 reported assaults,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=507)|

| 0:08:41| With cold weather conditions on their way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| we know we need to connect individuals with sheltering opportunities that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| promote better health outcomes and offer a path toward permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| In developing this strategy, which is one of clearance with support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| it's not a raid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| we have worked closely with partners who provide direct support to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=536)|

| 0:09:14| Formal notification of the planned cleanup began September 30th and is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| continuing to ensure folks know about the change and have time to prepare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| As the cleanup begins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| outreach workers will be onsite alongside our city public service crews to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| assist any remaining campers as they move away from the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| I want to stress because this has been misreported,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| we have room in our shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| Just to reiterate that we have room in our shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| Occupancy numbers fluctuate, but as of last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=581)|

| 0:09:51| there are resources available to help providers respond to the gaps that do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=591)|

| 0:10:09| As you all know, homelessness is a complex problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| and there's not a one size fits all solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| Addiction, poverty, and mental illness compound the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=614)|

| 0:10:23| options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| but we also need to act to address the challenges immediately in front of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| Winter is coming and now is the time to work to connect our unsheltered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| neighbors with safer, healthier shelter environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| With that said, I want to take a moment to thank all our service providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=636)|

| 0:11:45| and we are currently trying to coordinate more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=705)|

| 0:11:52| brings together a lot of different ideas and perspectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| and one goal is to save lives and livelihoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=715)|

| 0:12:23| but from the signs on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| the messages on the jumbotron and the distancing in the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=745)|

| 0:16:08| On October 14th and October 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| So you can look for those signs on the buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| To get an idea of what buses pass by an early voting location, or you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| Speak with cat staff and they can help you find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| The closest place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| The other thing that I wanted to ask is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| In your announcement, Mayor, you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| Shared a big change in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| And I wondered as a community, if we'll have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| An opportunity to discuss that, or if it's a final done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| Where are we at with, with this new policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| You're talking about our, our asking people to get into shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| Do before winter comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| Yeah, yeah, that is a, we, we had a temporary policy during.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| Beginning of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| And we had to adjust because our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| our shelters hadn't had time to adjust to COVID safety thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| So now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| They have had time to adjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| And we are doing something we've done before is encouraging people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| get the support they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| To get out of the cold weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| And my visit today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| And talking to the people down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| And encouraging them to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| And getting them into real shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| Connected to services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| Is an ongoing policy that we have had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| We just had that temporary change at the beginning of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| But that's that. Yeah, that's, that's moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1071)|
| 0:17:59| I thought the new policy we had in place in the city was because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| the CDC guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| we're always making sure that if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| if they needed to have extra space and safety and cleaning protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| Then the shelters were okay. And now our.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| I think I've shared some information with you from the shelters and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| facilities that they have adopted those protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| And so we are doing things consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| So with the 110 beds available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| is that the total number of homeless that we have on the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| I don't know exactly. That's the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| Probably less than that is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| In black stock today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| That would be my question. If there are not beds available for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| We have a dashboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| HMIS dashboard that does its best to sort of calculate and keep track of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| the number of beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| But, but the best resource to do that is to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| We can contact Mike Dunthorne, our homeless service coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| or, or the providers themselves, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| the city doesn't directly run a homeless shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| We work with our partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| And BMC and the Salvation Army and other community partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| So, so those are, those are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| we have the information that we shared with you and, and with their beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| 110 available right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| And so that's, that's the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| I know there are a lot of people concerned that people were going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| have no place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| And, and, you know, I would, I share that concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| but I think there is room at the shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| And also some people may find rooms with family and relatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| I had conversations with people today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| Who were already making plans to reconnect with family and relatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| And friends where they would be able to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| I just wanted to lift the issue up and ask some questions because there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| just seems to be a disconnect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| That somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| All of a sudden we've solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| The homeless crisis in Knoxville and there's beds for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| And they just need to leave the streets and get to the bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| And that just doesn't seem like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| It's plausible to me. It seems like as soon as this campus cleared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| we're going to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Concerns and complaints from other parts of Knoxville as we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| When camps have been cleared like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| I wonder if the city is planning to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| I would never claim to have solved homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| It's a very complex problem. As I said, in my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| And I'm just saying that the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| This administration has looked carefully and we've taken the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| recommendations of the people who actually work with the homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| This is not American cannons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| Recommendation. This is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| The recommendation and partnership with the people who serve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| homeless every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| And I'm just saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| I would never claim to have solved homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| It's a very complex problem. As I said, in my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| And I'm just saying that the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| This administration has looked carefully and we've taken the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| recommendations of the people who actually work with the homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| And I'm just saying that the recommendation and partnership with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| the people who serve the homeless every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| So this is not a disconnect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| We, we, we are working with the people who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| Have suggested and said that this is that what's happening on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| black stock is not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| It's not humane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| And this is a better path forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| That's safer for the homeless residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| This, this, this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| Not an unusual step. We have done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| We've done this before, before I was mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| And this is the best. I mean, there's no easy solutions, but this isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| I think the most compassionate way forward right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| as we also continue to work on other avenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| Dealing with opioid addiction and affordable housing and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| Drug treatment and mental health. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| Thank you for the questions and I don't have any further information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| To add, but if there are any other reports from other council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| Now's a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| Otherwise we can move on to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| Council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Thank you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| Council members agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| 12 G was regarding science standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| In the institutional district that was postponed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| As you remember from just a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| And it will be taken up in our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| So that will be on our agenda for the next meeting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| In council's workshop on the subject council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| Requested options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| With regard to those science standards in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| So consistent with council's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| I've asked Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| To draft institutional science standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| That planning commission had reviewed or considered at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| And so that'll be on our agenda for the next meeting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Any other reports from council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| Council member writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| I just had a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| Follow-up question to the previous discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1371)|

| 0:23:31| A few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1411)|

| 0:23:40| Specifically to deal with getting input on the emergency solutions grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1420)|

| 0:25:49| The reason I raised this is because we're talking about unhoused folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| who don't have their own cell phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1550)|

| 0:27:00| Rather than make people wait until the end of a meeting the format is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| I mean, the format is a known established thing. So, I'm not sure why we can't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1626)|
| 0:27:14| another meeting on the exact topic in a timely fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| I like that. I'm able to hear it from more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1638)|
| 0:27:25| The only thing I would say is that because there's no agenda item, it's a policy of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| administration. And this is a particularly vulnerable population with a lack of resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1652)|
| 0:27:41| who want to speak publicly on this issue, not in private meetings, but who want to speak publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| And I believe that's an important part of our public forum is giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| public an opportunity to state publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| But is that not established as public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1676)|
| 0:28:04| Right. And I said this would be an exception because we're talking about a particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| vulnerable population who do not have access to their own resources, but who are waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| right now next to a cell phone and would be able to share with us now. And I would not say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1696)|
| 0:28:23| this is the only time it would have happened. We certainly brought speakers forward to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| on items that were shared in a mayor or council's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| Thank you. It seems to me that the way forward is for someone to make a motion to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| the agenda, have a second, and we vote. That's the way we change the order of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| Thank you, Council Member Fugate. Sorry for, I should have said that myself as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| presiding officer. Is there a motion to change the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| I'll make the motion to add a public forum to the beginning of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| Is there a second to this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| Mr. Johnson, could you tell us how many people we have signed up for public forum, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| Total is nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| Okay. And I want to point a clarification. Is this motion to change public forum to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| beginning of this meeting, this is only this one time for this particular meeting, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1766)|
| 0:29:37| It would have to be the, your ordinance for the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| state's public forum is at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| Suspend the rules for an individual meeting is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| Can we ask for Mr. Frost to shed some light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1788)|
| 0:29:55| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Mr. Johnson is correct. That's what the ordinance provide. You'd be suspending the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| for this meeting only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| Okay. There's a motion on the floor. I haven't heard a second. Council Member Beto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| Thank you, Mayor. Just a point of clarification. Is the motion to allow all of the public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| speakers to speak or I thought the specific discussion was about a certain, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1818)|
| 0:30:27| individual or individuals who might not otherwise have access to a cell phone in a couple of hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| when we get to public forum. So I was unclear what we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| Well, there's no way of knowing what people sign up for because public forum isn't based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| on a topic. They just say they're speaking to something. So, you know, we can stop and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1841)|
| 0:30:50| you know, that's my understanding. I don't know how we distinguish who's for which topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| Except wait and hear from them in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| Council Member Ratting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| I have a question and a comment. Question number one is how many people are signed up for public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| forum, Mr. Johnson? Nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| Nine total? Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| Okay. Well, I think it would be something to sort through. So if we're going to suspend the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| and have people speak at the top, the game of sorting people seems untenable and we just need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1880)|
| 0:31:28| to do the nine. The only thing I will say is there are people wanting to speak. I hear Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| Member Parker about that. I wish we had discussed this in advance or the mayor had known or Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1893)|
| 0:31:40| Johnson had known that there were going to be folks that needed to be at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| There are also people on the call waiting for their agenda items. So just of note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| So secondly, specifically someone who waited three hours to speak at our last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| and their item got postponed and I told them it would be quick tonight. Secondly, I would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| want this to preclude a second meeting or, I'm sorry, not a second meeting, a meeting to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| about this. With this council, we have not done a workshop on homeless issues. We did it, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1927)|
| 0:32:14| after some of us came on council three-ish years ago. So given COVID and other issues and the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1934)|
| 0:32:22| that we're workshopping ourselves to death these days, I would like to make a request that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| either have a workshop or some form of public meeting to talk about these issues in light of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| the fact that the quarterly meetings haven't been regularly and there have been some changes. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1952)|
| 0:32:39| I'll vote to move this, but I don't want the request to have additional discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1959)|
| 0:32:46| of only this topic being lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| I think the motion on the floor is ambiguous. I believe it's for all of public forum to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1972)|
| 0:32:59| right now and put the rest of the agenda after. But I don't know. I mean, I'm just trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1979)|
| 0:33:07| clarify what the motion is. Ms. Parker, there's no second on the motion? Is there a second on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| the motion? There's no second on the motion. Okay. So Mayor, I think that we were just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=1993)|
| 0:33:23| we were still in question and conversation mode. So at this point, due to the sensitivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2003)|
| 0:33:32| of the topic of conversation and the circumstances around some of those vulnerable people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| are impacted and want to speak to this, I will second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| Okay. The motion, what is the motion that were for all public forum to happen now? Just clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| Yes. Okay. I made a motion to add public forum to the beginning of the meeting. We can amend it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2029)|
| 0:33:56| and say just for speakers on the topic of the encampments. I'm fine with all nine speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| at the beginning. Okay. So I think the motion is to add all the public forum to the beginning of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2042)|
| 0:34:10| the meeting. It's been made by Council Member Parker and seconded by Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| Does everyone understand what the motion is? Okay. Is there any further discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2055)|
| 0:34:22| Seeing none, Mr. Johnson, please conduct a roll call vote on moving public forum to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2062)|
| 0:34:31| Council Member Parker? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| Council Member Ryder? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2075)|

| 0:34:47| Council Member Smith? No. I don't think it's fair to everybody else that's waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| Council Member Testerman? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| You're muted, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| Sorry. No, but I think this is something we should talk about. But my problem is doing it just right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| in the middle of a meeting without any preparation. And we also have people waiting who are expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2111)|
| 0:35:19| to speak in a certain order. I think we should revisit this and have a discussion. But today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| I'm voting no. Council Member Fugates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| No. And Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| Yes. Mayor, the vote was five against, four in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| Okay. Motion to change the agenda fails. Moving on to item 9A, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2137)|

| 0:39:23| This first person signed up to speak in favor is Mr. Benjamin Mullins. Mr. Mullins, are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| on the call? I am. Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500. I'm here for Mr. Tom Brandon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2368)|
| 0:39:36| Also in the room with me is Mr. John Lyle, who represents Mr. Brandon as well. I think he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2376)|
| 0:39:43| filed the original rezoning application for Mr. Brandon. Okay. Did you have any comments or were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2383)|
| 0:39:51| you just making yourself available to answer questions? Well, we're available to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| questions. I know Councilwoman Ryder made a motion to approve. We certainly support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| This was a property that was zoned I-3 before the new zoning ordinance was adopted. It is being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| in industrial use currently, but the rezoning of the property moved it to a neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2407)|
| 0:40:15| Our client wants us to have it rezoned to IG, which is the zoning, the prior zoning equivalent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| for the property because it would allow the full uses that are available in the industrial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2421)|
| 0:40:29| to be available to him in the future, no matter what happens with his current tenant. He's had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| a tenant in place for 2006. However, if that tenant were to leave, he would lose his preexisting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| nonconforming rights and he would like to maintain the value of his property with the industrial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| intact. So, with that, we would respectfully ask that the Council approve the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2445)|
| 0:40:54| Thank you, Mr. Mons. Mr. Lyle, John Lyle, has also signed up to speak. It sounds like he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| in on the same call. Does he wish to speak as well? I am. This is John Lyle, L-Y-L-E 118 North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2460)|
| 0:41:08| Peters Road, Knoxville, Tennessee. My comment would be, I reached out to all City Council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2468)|
| 0:41:16| and the Mayor with hopefully a fairly detailed description of exactly what our issues are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2476)|
| 0:41:24| I didn't receive any phone calls from anyone. I asked if anybody had any questions. I'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| very happy to meet with anyone on site. And I spoke with Lauren. She's the City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2490)|
| 0:41:40| person for the district. She's the only person that I have spoken to about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| Certainly, we're available for any questions. We would absolutely support the rezoning effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2506)|
| 0:41:53| I would make one other key point here. This area is in a flood zone. So, we have a serious issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2513)|
| 0:42:01| if we're trying to come up with some kind of commercial use for it besides what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| It is very limited. And the fact that Mr. Brandon has been able to come up with a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2527)|
| 0:42:14| and have it be in effect since 2006, it's still in effect. We anticipate it continuing to be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2534)|
| 0:42:22| effect. This may be the highest and best use. It might be the only use of the property for going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2542)|
| 0:42:29| forward. And I would also say Mr. Brandon needs the money. This is an important income to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| I would hope Council would support us, allow us to have the zoning that he had when he bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2556)|
| 0:42:42| the property. Thank you, Mr. Lyle. Council Members, that concludes public, people signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2562)|
| 0:42:51| to speak to this agenda item. Mr. Thomas, I think you'd raised your hand. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| Yes, I originally had some questions about rezoning this up to industrial from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2577)|
| 0:43:04| CN. And since then, I've studied the packet. I've talked to the staff of the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2584)|
| 0:43:12| also took a look at the property. And the points that Mr. Lyle made at the end probably are right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| on point. This is high flood prone area. You know, that's noted in the report. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2597)|
| 0:43:27| anybody that would try to go with CN there and build something would probably be doing at their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2607)|
| 0:43:33| hazard and maybe even industrial. So the use of the property right now probably is maybe the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2613)|
| 0:43:42| use actually for that property. They're generally just parking trailers there. They're not polluting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2622)|
| 0:43:49| It's not quiet. I was in the park today right across from where this part of particle piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2629)|
| 0:43:58| of land is. And I didn't see any nuisance or disruption. So I was just kind of looking at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2638)|
| 0:44:04| totality of the circumstances. But since the postponement two weeks ago, I can recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2644)|
| 0:44:11| I can agree with the staff's recommendation. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| Thank you, Council Member Thomas. Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| I just wanted to follow up on that. Thank you, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Lyle and Mr. Mullins as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2661)|
| 0:44:28| I have, I do acknowledge this is an entrance to my neighborhood. I did not receive any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2668)|
| 0:44:35| even through the delays, any comments from any neighbors on this. I have had conversations with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| the city forester, Casey Krause, about additional trees to screen because this has been a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2681)|
| 0:44:52| industrial use that got changed during the recode process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| There is a small corner because of the bridge reconstruction that is owned by the city. Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| Krause went out and looked for it, looked at it. Unfortunately, that corner that belongs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| the city that abuts the bridge and Tom's property cannot be used for screening trees because it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2707)|
| 0:45:15| sewer and gas lines. So unfortunately, that didn't work out. So Mr. Krause and I are going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| continued conversations about maybe some more tree screening on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| on the Greenway side, to kind of buffer a little bit there. So I appreciate all the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2726)|
| 0:45:35| We may have more of these. I think we're only about three quarters of the way into the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| year of the two years that people can submit for these. So they may trickle to us, or maybe we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| see less, and we've seen them on the front end. But that was, for those of us who went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| recode, this was a big part of the process is to re-examine these on a one-by-one basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| Thank you, Council Member Ryder. Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| Just quickly, and I just want to say I concur, I did visit the property with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2761)|
| 0:46:08| business owner that's been leasing this property for the last 15 years. So it seems definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2768)|
| 0:46:15| suitable and certainly not eligible for residential zoning at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2775)|
| 0:46:23| Thank you, Council Member Testerman. Any further questions or comments from Council? Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| Yes, I appreciate the efforts by Ms. Ryder. I'll be glad to join in those efforts. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| it was a good discussion here. I appreciate it being postponed for a couple of weeks so I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| allay some of my concerns. But again, I can go along with the staff's recommendation on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2799)|
| 0:46:46| Thank you. Thank you. Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2806)|

| 0:49:55| utter and extreme disappointment in all of City Council and the Mayor. The neighborhood has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| been presented with a final or even final draft plans for this project. I find it very Trumpian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| that the most detailed description of what is actually going to happen is only issued when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=3005)|

| 0:56:50| that would otherwise not have it? Sure, and I failed to say Becky Wade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=3410)|
| 0:56:57| Director of Housing and Neighborhood Development. Yeah, one of the great things about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=3417)|
| 0:57:05| our ability to acquire property through the Chronic Problem Property Program and then sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| them through Homemakers is that it takes dilapidated, vacant, underutilized properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=3431)|
| 0:57:19| that have not been able to attract any market potential. So we are able to purchase properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=3439)|
| 0:57:29| and clear title so that they can be sold to new developers for whether it's affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=3449)|
| 0:57:37| housing that the person buying it will live in, or to develop it for rental or for sale housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| So it takes something that couldn't be used before and is a blighting influence on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| neighborhood and turns that around. So without Homemakers, what would happen with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=3469)|
| 0:57:56| some of these parcels? I'd say that the city could surplus sale them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| And in that case, we would have no control over when something was developed or even if it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=3482)|
| 0:58:11| developed. Homemakers requires the purchaser of the property to begin construction or rehab within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=3491)|
| 0:58:19| six months and complete the project within a year, or we can take the property back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=3499)|
| 0:58:26| So it guarantees that a vacant or underutilized or problem property is going to be redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=3506)|

| 1:08:49| And I'd like to thank you, Mayor Kincaid and the council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4129)|
| 1:08:56| Obviously, I'm in favor of any improvements for Morningside Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| I do have some concerns about the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| That's the main thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| The other thing is really the overall usage, whether we get something new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4147)|
| 1:09:12| or whether we keep what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| There's going to have to be an overall plan to increase residents' usage of what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4154)|
| 1:09:21| But relating to the signage in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| I looked at three areas where I felt signs could go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| Obviously, at the main entry from Dandridge Avenue and Hazen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| there's currently the big concrete sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| And then there's some smaller signs attached to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| There's four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| And then beside the concrete sign, there's actually a plaque with a concrete base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4180)|
| 1:09:47| So I had not known exactly what type of size we were looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| until the Zoom meeting on September 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| The Knoxville City Public Property Naming Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| which at that time, Scott Wilson with Blue Cross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| gave me an idea and all the other members of just the size of that sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4207)|
| 1:10:15| But I'll get back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| The other areas in my estimation of where signs could go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| is right across from Haley Heritage Square, where you enter into the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| And then as you go past that, as you turn the corner on Hazen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| there's another walkway, maybe two, that allows you to enter into Morningside Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4235)|
| 1:10:45| My preference, and I've used this park since I was a young man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4245)|
| 1:10:51| so I'm very familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| Used to ride a bike, exercise in it, took my kids to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| So I'm very familiar with this park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| The place where I would like to see a sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| if we're going to have one that has Blue Cross Healthy Ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| would be right past, there's a pavilion currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| when you enter into the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| as you enter across from the Haley Heritage site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| And before you actually start to get to where the work is going to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4280)|
| 1:11:26| with Blue Cross as a hill, before you get to the large boulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| And to me, that would be the ideal place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| But because the sign is so large, and I'm going to get back to the dimensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| Scott Wilson said that the dimensions are 15 feet tall by eight feet across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4298)|
| 1:11:44| And to me, that's overwhelming wherever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| But if you're going to put that type of signage within Morningside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| it definitely needs to be within where you are going to do your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| And the other concern I have about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| is that he said that the requirement for the grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| the $5.2 million grant, is that there needs to be two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4325)|
| 1:12:11| Now, I'm okay with one, but now you're putting two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| So my point is that Blue Cross Healthy Ways is really overshadowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4335)|
| 1:12:22| even though there's nothing at the main entry of Dandridge and Hazen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4342)|
| 1:12:28| Once you get into the park, those are very huge signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4348)|
| 1:12:34| The five signs that are at the main entryway are very miniscule compared to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4354)|
| 1:12:44| The one for Knoxville City Recreation and Parks is a circular sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| and it's 14 inches in diameter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| Then you have one from the Tennessee Recreation Trails Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| which is a federal and local state cooperative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| That's an eight by 10 plastic engraved sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| Then you have the improvements to this site were financed in part by the Urban Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| and Recreation Recovery Program grant for the U.S. Interior and National Parks Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4389)|
| 1:13:17| That's an aluminum sign that's six by 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| So my-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| Mr. Kemp, you have one more minute, up to one more minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| The largest sign is actually in that main entry area is a 16 and 1-8 by 16 and 1-8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4408)|
| 1:13:35| And I want to get to my final comments, and that is that I think it's imperative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4415)|
| 1:13:43| that the city parks and recreation, along with other community organizations and agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| develop and implement a strategic plan for multi-generation use for Morningside Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4428)|
| 1:13:55| especially for the community residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| Otherwise, the new Blue Cross Healthy Place improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| will meet the same fate as what currently exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| and that is grossly underutilized by the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| So whether it's new or whether it's old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| there's going to have to be a very important part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| where the city of parks structure something for the usage of that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| Okay, that's your five minutes, Mr. Kemp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| We have another speaker signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| Let's see, the next person to sign up to speak to this item is Yvette Fragile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4472)|
| 1:14:39| Ms. Fragile, if I hope I pronounced that correctly, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| I am on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| My name is Yvette Fragile, and close enough, Mayor Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| My address is 735 LeConte Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| I am a resident of Morningside Heights neighborhood for the past five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4496)|
| 1:15:02| I'm also the president of the Mabry-Hazen House Association Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| which is located across the street from Morningside Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| and the park is three streets over from where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| So I am very familiar with the park as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| and I agree with Mr. Kemp on several of his points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4518)|
| 1:15:23| I did have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| I haven't been able to see the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| I was not in some of the earlier meetings and kind of found out about it afterward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4526)|
| 1:15:33| The size of the sign does seem a little large in terms of being for the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4533)|
| 1:15:39| The park is a lovely place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| It is a bit shabby, but it does have a lot of potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| so I was very excited to hear about the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| but I know the next point is really kind of talking more about the plans themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| and this was really more about the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| I am supportive of Blue Cross Blue Shield having a sign in the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| much to Mr. Kemp's point as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| but that does seem rather oversized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| especially in consideration of the other signage in the park as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4566)|
| 1:16:12| So I would be in support of it, but I'll be it with some alterations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| Okay, thank you, Ms. Fragil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| Council members, I just wanted to, before we get into any discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| I just wanted to give some more context to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| I've had the opportunity to visit Morningside Park over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| but also really recently, and it's a beautiful park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| It's 36 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| It's one of Knoxville's gems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| It's got a lot of the features that you heard the speakers address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| and I'm really excited that we're talking about a multi-million dollar improvement to a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4608)|
| 1:16:55| and this is going to be a huge asset in nearby neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4615)|
| 1:17:01| and I just want to thank you to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| for making a $5.5 million upgrade to a portion of this park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| and this is what we'll be getting to in the next agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| but they're linked, so I wanted to share comments on both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| So, we are going to be adding to the generous grant of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4636)|
| 1:17:25| several amenities to this park to make it a premier space for outdoor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| healthy, accessible, and inclusive recreation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| and to Mr. Kemp's concern is activating the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| and getting all the surrounding neighborhoods to use it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| So, it will have play spaces for younger and older children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| a challenge course fitness station, and 40-yard dash community pavilions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| a new multi-purpose playing field with bleachers, enhanced walking path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| and this one, and this last one is a really important one, restroom facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| It's really something that makes a big difference in people's ability to use the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4677)|
| 1:18:02| So, this is a big investment in Morningside Park and the people our neighborhood serves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4682)|
| 1:18:08| and I want to thank Blue Cross Blue Shield for selecting Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| and making this gift to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| So, I also want to thank Carol Evans and Legacy Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| for doing much of the heavy lifting to attract these funds to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| and I know my team is eager to work with the many partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| at Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation and the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| to breathe new life and energy into those tree-lined gems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| and they're really gorgeous, mature trees in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| Cheryl Ely is here to answer questions, our Director of Parks and Recreation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| Carol Evans, and a representative from Blue Cross Blue Shield are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4715)|
| 1:18:39| and I know that we have several partners who are neighbors and friends of the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| who already spoke about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| So, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| I'm certainly committed to continuing to work and communicate with the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| who will be using this park on how this amenity can be best deployed to serve their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4730)|
| 1:18:56| I'm really excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| So, that's all that I wanted to mention about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| So, I know Cheryl Ely is here to answer questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation folks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| So, council members, if you have any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| Vice Mayor McKenzie, you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| Yeah, thank you, Mayor, and I want to thank everyone who spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| And also, thank you to the Legacy Parks for submitting this grant application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| on behalf of Morningside and the residents there in Morningside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| I would also want to mention to Mr. Kemp that, absolutely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| we did talk about additional improvements that need to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| to the existing part of the park that will not be covered in this particular grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4776)|
| 1:19:41| So, I definitely understand what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| and that is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4783)|
| 1:19:44| We've had those conversations with City Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| I do want to address the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| And so, I'd like to ask Ms. Ely if you would please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| maybe just talk briefly about the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| It looks in our packet as if the Blue Cross Healthy Place branding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| and the archway is present in the existing spaces across our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| that have also received the grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| I also know that in our conversations that the Stone Morningside Park sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| that is at the top of the street where you turn into Morningside Park will remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| So, could you just speak briefly and confirm that information, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| Yes, ma'am, thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| Shirley Lee, Director of Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| And I also want to make sure that you all are aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| that King and Lucy Johnson here, Blue Cross Blue Shield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| who will also be able to answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| But the signage really will not be on Dantridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| It will be basically in the park close to and near the project area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| Mr. Kemp stated that he thought that that's where it should go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| and that's actually where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| There are two signs, and Keith, make sure I'm saying this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| but they will be basically within that project area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| They're not going to be across any streets, not going to be impeding anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| And again, the biggest thing is we are still designing what everything looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| So, they are still doing their due diligence right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| We're just working through contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| and I'm hoping that you all will approve us to go forward with this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| But Keith or Chelsea, if you want to add anything else to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| I greatly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4883)|
| 1:21:23| And thank you, everyone, for having us and for considering this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| We're really excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| If you could just state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| Yes, this is Keith King, 702 South Greenwood Avenue, Chattanooga, Tennessee, 37404.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4892)|
| 1:21:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| And yeah, so just to kind of clarify on the signage part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| it's not, you know, your typical kind of large-scale sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4906)|
| 1:21:52| It actually functions as a gateway into the park itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| So, we have this, when you visit our parks, which we opened one in Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| we have one in Huntland, Tennessee, and one in Henry Horton State Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4921)|
| 1:22:06| and one in Kingsport, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| Whenever you visit these parks, kind of the first thing that you'll pass through is this archway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| And so, that archway, it will have the words Blue Cross Healthy Place on the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| but above that, in kind of a curved portion of the sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| it'll still retain the name Morningside Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| So, definitely is a priority to still show respect to the name of the park as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4946)|
| 1:22:35| and definitely want to give that the marquee visibility that it has, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| Yeah, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4960)|
| 1:22:41| You'll see Councilperson McKenzie holding up an example of that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4961)|
| 1:22:48| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| Go ahead, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| Go on, if you have more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| No, I just wanted to, again, reiterate what Miss Eli said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| that these signs will be only at entry points inside of Morningside Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| that enter into where the actual Blue Cross Healthy Place space will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| which is actually going to be in a new parking area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4991)|
| 1:23:15| that will be located adjacent to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4995)|
| 1:23:18| And that's really to help with the inclusivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| so it gives closer parking access for people that have varying abilities of mobility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5001)|
| 1:23:28| so they can get access to the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| and really enjoy all the assets that we have on the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| Anything else, Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| Oh, Miss Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| I have a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| Miss Eli, this was a grant that you guys filled out, applied for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5024)|
| 1:23:50| but you also mentioned that, at a certain point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| you'll approve the contract, that's to get it started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| So, in your packet, basically, the mayor has to apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| has to basically sign the contract in order to move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| So, in your packet should be the contract that you all should be reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| in order to make a decision on, and that should be 11-I, I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5053)|
| 1:24:18| Yeah, H is adding the name to the sign, and I is the donation agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5058)|
| 1:24:25| So, it's part of the contract that we do need to change the name of the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| in order to get funding for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| It is not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5073)|
| 1:24:33| So, it's just the section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| Sorry, it's just the section that the assets will be placed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5076)|
| 1:24:40| So, it'll still be Morningside Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| so the area that we are improving will be called the Blue Cross Healthy Place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| at Morningside Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| What is making it the healthy place at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5088)|
| 1:24:53| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5093)|
| 1:24:53| What is making it a healthy place, a Blue Cross Healthy Place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| So, a Blue Cross Healthy Place is really the branding that we've gone with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| to help inform visitors that this space will have inclusive assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| it will have fitness assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5106)|
| 1:25:11| This park specifically will have a multi-purpose field, a play area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| So, really, if you visit any Blue Cross Healthy Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| the purpose of that branding is to let people know that this is a space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| we can go and connect with community members, exercise, play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5123)|
| 1:25:29| and other kinds of kind of active activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| Okay, how is that different than the other parks that have these amenities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5132)|
| 1:25:37| I don't care for the name Blue Cross Blue Shield on our park, on our city park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5137)|
| 1:25:42| I love that you are willing to give a gift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| but if that is a condition of the gift, then it's not really a gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5145)|
| 1:25:53| I'm going to jump in. I absolutely understand where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| The gift is actually coming from the Blue Cross Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| Can you state your name and address for the record and tell us who you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| Sure. I'm the Director of the Community Relations and Foundations Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| at Blue Cross. I manage the Blue Cross Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| I am located at 9221 Sugar Pine Drive, Soddy Daisy, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| 37379.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| You're welcome. And I completely understand where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| However, the funding is actually coming from our foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| It is a philanthropic arm of our enterprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| but it is not a portion of our not-for-profit corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| This is an initiative that our board decided about four years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| was important for us to create a signature cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| where we are able to make a difference in communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| What we decided the difference we wanted to make was creating space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5202)|
| 1:26:46| a place for people to come together, to connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| And to Keith's point earlier, we are creating an expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5209)|
| 1:26:54| So we have a design-build partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| Barge Designs is involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5217)|
| 1:26:58| Playcore Game Time is our main design-build partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| We have a certain standard and quality that we expect and require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| in order for a space to be called a Blue Cross Healthy Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| This is also something that has to be applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| And that's where this whole conversation comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| Legacy Parks, in conjunction with Cheryl and some of the other members of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| saw a need and saw that this could be a gift that would benefit the Morningside Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| And when Keith and I came and visited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| we could have danced back to Chattanooga at how beautiful this park was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| and how excited we were to partner with you all on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| The naming is a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| And unfortunately, because a separate entity submitted the proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| some of these things like who owns the property and who has to sign off on the contracting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| didn't go in the steps that we typically require when we're looking at finding a partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5263)|
| 1:27:50| And so this one was so important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| And we saw the value here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| And we know the community is excited about it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| That we really have worked very hard to make sure that we can answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| and make you all feel comfortable about this partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| So it's something I think it will be mutually beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| in that we as a foundation hope to have these across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| where if you're on I-40, you can pull up on an app and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| you know, my kids are driving me crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| I need to let them out and have a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| And you can find the next nearest Blue Cross Healthy Place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| and know that it's going to be, as Keith mentioned, inclusive, ADA compliant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| that there's going to be parking nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| And it will be a designated space that you know will be upkept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| based on a maintenance fund that we include in the grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| that should be an endowment for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| The warranties are all included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| Basically, it's setting an expectation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| making sure that your community has the best highest quality option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5323)|
| 1:28:48| when it comes to this park space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| It makes it feel like it's not a Knoxville-owned thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| It seems like purchasing a portion of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| and the amenities that we have just for an advertising purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| if it is a gift, then please give it as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| Well, we're not purchasing your amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| We're purchasing amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| No, it seems like it with that type of naming it right in the front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5362)|
| 1:29:23| I was just going to say, I appreciate Legacy Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| doing the work and finding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| I am the CEO of Girl Scouts, and we also saw that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| and thought about wanting to apply for our camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| It is fabulous that this will improve amenities in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5375)|
| 1:29:41| and provide resources that often taxpayers cannot provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5381)|
| 1:29:47| I really appreciate that it's a foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| I understand Council Member Singh's concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| but most philanthropic organizations with a donation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5394)|
| 1:30:01| get some sort of recognition for their significant donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| Sounds to me like this is Morningside Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| which happens to be a Blue Cross Blue Shield healthy place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5409)|
| 1:30:14| I don't think I'm doing the right name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| but it would still be Morningside Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| I assume that's what's happening in Kingsport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| and the other cities that you have worked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| Yeah, I would just add first that this is not so different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5426)|
| 1:30:32| from where we have dog parks, let's say PetSafe dog parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| It's pretty similar to the HGTV overlook at Lakeshore Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| where you go to Lakeshore Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| and these have been donations from private entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| Does it give them some benefit of showing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| that they're involved in donating things to the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| Yes, but I think the benefit to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| is considerable and I'm really excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| about this investment in Morningside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| and hope you'll support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| Did I see, Ms. Parker, did you have your hand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| Yes, I have similar concerns as Councilwoman Singh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| and community members who called in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5469)|
| 1:31:14| I don't know the size of signs at other locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5474)|
| 1:31:19| but when I think about the PetSafe sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| it seems quite small, not the 15 foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| but eight foot that we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5485)|
| 1:31:31| One question, I'm a little confused by the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| and trying to figure out where a massive archway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| would be placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| Does this project require a new roadway for the park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| The archway actually goes over a sidewalk entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| It's essentially, it's a pedestrian entryway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| But yes, there would be a roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| that would give parking access adjacent to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| So that it would give access to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| that have different abilities to have wheelchair access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| that isn't currently available on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| So it would actually bring it to an ADA compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| Yeah, that's a pretty big deal that accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| I mean, I'm a strong supporter of universal design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| and some of our parks have it and some do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| And it would be a great amenity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| to make Morningside Park universally accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| If you've had a chance to walk in there, it's gorgeous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| But if you're in a wheelchair or even using a stroller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5549)|
| 1:32:33| it might not be so accessible right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| And then I'm looking at the diagram and trying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| I can see where the new roadway, I think would come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| Where is the sidewalk where the sign would go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5567)|
| 1:32:51| So the diagram, if you're looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| this is the one that has like the colored boxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| kind of laid out on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| So the kind of lighter gray line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| that kind of goes all the way around the outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| that is a walkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| And also that sidewalk that comes from the parking area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| it'll be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| So I think the first one that we've proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| is between where the pavilion and the playground space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| would be and the second one would be up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| kind of farther north to where that second pavilion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| So it'd be just over those two entry points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| And I will reiterate that our design and build partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| who actually, I believe we have some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| represented on this call as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| They still have to get on site and really dig in deeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| into the more geotechnical information of the site itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5623)|
| 1:33:48| to have really a better understanding of that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| But this is the plan as they have kind of designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5631)|
| 1:33:56| based on their initial kind of findings on the site itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| But those two archways, just to circle back to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| will be coming from those two specific parking areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| So it's gonna be not even visible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| from even like the Hazen Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| or other entry points of Morningside Park at a larger scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5654)|
| 1:34:20| And is the size of that sign a part of the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| or would you all be open to a smaller sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5664)|
| 1:34:28| So it's part of the branding package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| which is part of that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| And it's just kind of the standardized sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| So we have a small park that's in Hutman, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| and it also is at the entry point of that sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| as well as the entry point of the playground in that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| So it's just something that's set up with the package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| And I know it's, I have a bias obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| but I do feel like that it fits into the actual branding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| When you visit the site, it does not feel too imposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| as far as like, it doesn't feel like a blinking billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| of any kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5700)|
| 1:35:00| It does feel like an entry gateway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| that you would maybe see if you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| to a different kind of amusement park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| or zoo or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| It's definitely an entry point gateway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| It's not so much a billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| or any sort of imposing sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| The example we have in our packet of Kingsport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5720)|
| 1:35:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| Seems quite large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| Is that the type of sign you're imagining for Morningside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5735)|
| 1:35:36| Those are the questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5737)|
| 1:35:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| I'm going to go back and just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| coming from the nonprofit world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| and understanding how dependent we are on grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5749)|
| 1:35:56| Again, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| It's five and a half million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| is substantial investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| And grant process is incredibly competitive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5763)|
| 1:36:10| And so the fact that we were awarded this type of infusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5770)|
| 1:36:16| into an absolutely beautiful park and space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| I think it is a gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| But knowing there are certain conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5785)|
| 1:36:32| that do come with these types of investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| and awards, grant awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| 15 by eight, I know sitting in a room seems quite large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| but at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| if they're taking in consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| the environmental landscape of the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| and trying to make it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| you're measuring against the sky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| it works pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| So I'm just going to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| Five and a half million dollars is an infusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| and investment into one of our local parks is remarkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5822)|
| 1:37:06| So that's all I needed to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| I'm familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| I know it's competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| and I feel like we should feel very fortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| to have been chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| Thank you, Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| Well, Cheryl Illey, did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| And then Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| Thank you, Mayor, for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| The only other thing I just wanted to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| is one of the things I think Councilwoman Singh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| kind of brought up is that about what is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5857)|
| 1:37:41| And the biggest thing is about money-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| we are getting with this 5.5, it's actually 4.6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| And Keith, make sure I'm right on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| The other 920,000 will go towards maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| long-term maintenance for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| So if you think about that in the scheme of what we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| in our Parks and Recreation Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| that really is a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| And it really does help our department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| to basically spread our money out to other parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| So I wanted to make sure that we added that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| to make sure people were aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| The other thing is it is a 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| again, we get maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| And so I think there was a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| of whether or not it was going to perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| And the biggest thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| it goes through the length of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| And Keith and Chelsea, make sure I'm correct on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5906)|
| 1:38:29| But if there's any issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| we can basically decide and agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| that we will no longer want to be partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| So there is that possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| So in your contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| there's a contract in your packet there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| we'll outline that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| But I just wanted to make sure that you all had that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| and understood the other space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| the other pieces of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5931)|
| 1:38:51| And just to add on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| we do set the maintenance funds aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| with a community foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| with the hope and expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| that they'll grow over those years as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5940)|
| 1:39:01| So those dollars will be larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| when hopefully you're getting them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| because we do have really great warranties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| on all the play core and game time equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| that they install.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| So definitely want this to be a lasting impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| Ms. Ely and Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| Ms. Ely answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| It was related to the term of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| And I believe there's a 10 year renewal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| after that 20 years, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5973)|
| 1:39:33| So that gives Blue Cross enough time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| to save up for the next round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| I know my deputy David Brace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| over operations has been part of this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| and wanted to just ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| to sort of give us a little overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| of the community engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| and the grant and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| Mr. Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| David Brace, Chief Operating Officer for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| And just wanted to, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6000)|
| 1:40:01| thank Mr. King and Ms. Johnson and the foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| I think it is a grant that we sought out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6005)|
| 1:40:09| with one of our key partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| Legacy Parks and Ms. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| I think you're all familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| with the good work that Legacy has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| in our community really since it was created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| to grow park space, green space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| healthy activities throughout our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| They created the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| So we sought this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| And if you look at the total investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| that 5.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| and it's amazing to have a grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| that includes long-term maintenance dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| I mean, that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| from my almost two decades of experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| that's almost unheard of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| And so the way the foundation looks at this investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| is really from a sustainability perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| for the ongoing maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| out of one and done, ribbon cutting, sign, we leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| Their brand, and that's why the signage is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| Part of that long-term commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| is to brand that space with the foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| And again, as Mayor Kincaid had mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| that's not uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| We've done that with the donations from Mr. Boyd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| and PetSafe Parks throughout the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| and all the investments at Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| There was a significant amount of community process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| that my colleagues, Ms. Ely and Mr. Lomax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| worked with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| because this really is an investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| in not only the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| but in the neighborhoods that are adjacent to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6092)|
| 1:41:36| And it really opens up the road access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| The accessibility opens up an area of Morningside Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| that is not accessible to all folks right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| It's a large open space near a pavilion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| that, again, is now gonna be open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| to all residents of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| and of course, the county and people that visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| So there was community process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| I think, thank you so much, Ms. Johnson and Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6120)|
| 1:42:05| Again, we sought this out as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| and Legacy Parks, thank you to Legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| And there was good community process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| and we look forward, obviously, to the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| and this long-term investment in Morningside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6135)|
| 1:42:20| Thank you, Mr. Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| Carol Evans is on the call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| if anyone has questions from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6146)|

| 1:43:59| 11-I, first is Carol Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| Ms. Evans, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| Here I am, yes, I'm here, unmuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| Okay, hi, if you could just start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| Sure, yeah, Carol Evans, 900 Volunteer Landing Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6252)|
| 1:44:18| with Legacy Parks Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| and good to see all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| and good to see Chelsea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| I've spoken to you on the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6263)|
| 1:44:24| and she made that same comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| when we spoke a while ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| about that she had attended UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| and had she known that park was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| she never would have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6273)|
| 1:44:34| So I think sometimes we don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| you know, it's wonderful to hear from others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| how spectacular our natural assets are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| And I think we are thrilled to be able to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6281)|
| 1:44:45| for this grant on behalf of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| and work closely with Cheryl at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| And Morningside Park was just the natural location for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6288)|
| 1:44:53| When you think about, as you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| just the beautiful space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| and the central location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| you know, it's already in the hub of destination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| but what's happening with the Science Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| and the Gateway Park Terminus will be even more so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| But I think what we appreciated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| and I know the community wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| is sort of alignment with Blue Cross Foundation's values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| to be very inclusive for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| And so we are fortunate to have Ross Fowler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| donate all the design time on the initial concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| that really addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| how do we make something for all ages, for all abilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| and really have a park that everyone can go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| for all of what they hope to be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| and accidentally get fit and healthy as a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| So the proximity to Isabella Towers is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| I think that's a community that now can access a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| very close for therapeutic recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| And so all of that, I think never,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| the only thing to add to everything everyone has said is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| in addition, and David, thank you for those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| I think in addition to the very much community engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6351)|
| 1:45:55| the city did, we reached out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| to sort of adaptable sorts community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| and got their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6360)|
| 1:46:00| And there was a great need for the places to recreate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| for those with differing abilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6363)|
| 1:46:04| So this will provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| And I think now more than ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| we all recognize the value of parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| They mean a lot, but what we've learned over and over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| close to home parks are really critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| As you probably know, only about 25% of our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| get the required amount of daily activity they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| But the most recent study found that children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| who have a place to play within a half mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| of where they live are five times more likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| to be of healthy weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6395)|
| 1:46:36| And so this park alone, imagine where it's located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| in the neighborhood and community surrounding it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| to have that kind of effect on our children's health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| As well as economy, 5% increase in physical activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| is estimated about saving our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| about $13 million in health costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| So I'm probably speaking the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| that Blue Cross already knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| But I do think from the health and vitality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| of our community that this grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| will really bring this to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| and really be a neighborhood park for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| So I just wanted to say really thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| for the opportunity to partner with Cheryl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| We have a great collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6431)|
| 1:47:12| We love helping in any way that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| to support city projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| And so you can count on us as this moves forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| to help in any way that Lexi Parks can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| So thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6442)|
| 1:47:23| Thank you, Ms. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| Next person signed up to speak is Yvette Fragil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| Good evening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| Yes, Mayor Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6453)|
| 1:47:35| This is Yvette Fragil, 735 LeConte Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| And it's very interesting hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| all of the conversation about the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| And definitely, it would be crazy to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| that you wouldn't want a $5.5 million investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| in a park that was three streets over from your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| And I do think overall, it could be a very good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| But when I first heard about this last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| so Aaron Streeter is a friend of mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| and was a board member with me at Mabry-Hazen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| the large white house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6484)|
| 1:48:05| the family who donated all the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| where Market Square is today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| and lots of other things going on in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| We knew nothing about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| And that is the one thing in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| that's giving me a little bit of pause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| is that myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6498)|
| 1:48:19| and then I let a lot of other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| in the neighborhood know that this was being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| that all we knew was that the name was being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| to possibly be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| And that Blue Cross Blue Shield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| was going to be making a donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| And the reaction I got from a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| is that our park is not for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| If we wanna change our park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| let's raise the money, let's do it for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| That was kind of the first initial reaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| that I got from a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| Now, Mr. Charles Lomax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| who is with the Community Empowerment Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| did reach out to me very kindly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6534)|
| 1:48:57| and gave some more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| about the size of the investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| And it's nothing that you can kind of shirk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6542)|
| 1:49:05| or turn your back on that amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| One would probably be crazy to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| but I still think that the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6550)|
| 1:49:13| deserves the opportunity to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| that this is all in our back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| This is our neighborhood too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| It's part of the larger city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| but none of us knew about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| None of us have seen plans for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6564)|
| 1:49:27| We would just, I think we deserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| as members of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| and citizens of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| deserve to have a voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| in what's going on with the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| I can appreciate the foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| and the meaning behind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| and wanting to give our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| and our citizens a better place to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| and to get exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| But I have lots of questions like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| will trees be torn down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6589)|
| 1:49:50| Where are the bathrooms going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| And it's kind of made out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| that nobody uses that park at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| It may be a little underutilized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6595)|
| 1:49:56| but I'm there many, many times a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| And there's lots of people who play disc golf there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| And a 15 by eight sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| the Alex Haley statue that sits proud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| at the top of Morningside Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| is probably that size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| And so again, and so as we were sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| I went and looked online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| at some of the other parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6621)|
| 1:50:22| that you all have done, Chelsea and Keith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| they look nice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6624)|
| 1:50:25| but it is definitely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| it feels very Blue Cross Blue Shield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| And when we're talking about Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| and PetSafe Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| the focus is on the natural beauty of those parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6633)|
| 1:50:36| and being a part of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| and not necessarily on the business itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| And I understand you have to get something in return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6642)|
| 1:50:45| for the investment that you're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| And I have no problem with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| but I just wanna be sensitive again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| to the people who live in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| the history of this area and celebrating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| Would I love for more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| from all over the city to come here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| Absolutely, it fits in with a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6662)|
| 1:51:03| of the other exciting things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| that are happening in Morningside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| But I will, again, return to the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| that we at Mayberry Hazen House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| we're not involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6672)|
| 1:51:13| in any of the conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| nor were any of the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| of the neighborhood here right adjacent to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| because every house that I went to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| people that live right near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| and surrounding the park know nothing about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| And it just seems odd to me to take a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6686)|
| 1:51:30| to accept that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6690)|
| 1:51:31| And I've worked on grants too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6691)|
| 1:51:32| so I know how hard it is to get those funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| without really talking to anybody in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| to get everybody kind of behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6700)|
| 1:51:43| I won't say I'm against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| I won't say that I'm against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| Again, it's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| Overall, it would be an amazing thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| I just have questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| and maybe I'm a little late to the party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6716)|
| 1:51:59| Interested and will respectfully hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| what the council has to say on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| And thank you all for your interest in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| and for Morningside Park overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| And just have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| Thanks so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6732)|
| 1:52:12| Thank you, Ms. Bregio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6732)|
| 1:52:13| The next person signed up to speak on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| is Reverend Dr. Renee Kessler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| from the Cultural Exchange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| Are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| Hi, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| Mayor Kincaid, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6749)|
| 1:52:29| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| If you could just state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6753)|
| 1:52:33| My name is Renee Kessler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| and my address is 2327 Woodbine Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6755)|
| 1:52:40| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6763)|
| 1:52:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| First of all, I want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| that I appreciate the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| and I'm grateful for a city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6769)|
| 1:52:52| who takes your duty very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6772)|
| 1:52:57| about ensuring that all neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| and all communities have been properly vetted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6779)|
| 1:53:02| for whatever the opportunity is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6782)|
| 1:53:03| because we recognize that all money is not good money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6783)|
| 1:53:08| But I want to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| I want to speak on behalf of not only the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| that I'm a native Knoxvillian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| born and raised in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| and I live, I still live in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| I am also the president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| of the Beck Cultural Exchange Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| just a few blocks from Haley Heritage Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| in Morningside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6806)|
| 1:53:27| And I also grew up playing in Morningside Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| as Mr. Kemp mentioned when he was on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| And I got to tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6814)|
| 1:53:36| I am excited about the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6816)|
| 1:53:40| to bring investments into East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| I appreciate the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| about the size of the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6826)|
| 1:53:47| and marketing and branding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| because I think that's important conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| and discussion and I don't take that lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| So I appreciate that we have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| that kind of good in-depth discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6837)|
| 1:54:01| For the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| this is a blessing and an asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| that invest in a community that needs investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| that's always needed investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| And what makes me proud about this project now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| when I think about parks in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| and not only this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| because I'm very well, very much connected to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| and have been for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6860)|
| 1:54:24| is I think about almost 100 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| September 21st, 1922,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| the very first park for colored children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| which is what we would have been called in 1922,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| was the Cal Johnson Park of which Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| you know, you all just did some great renovations there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| and I'm grateful for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| But on that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| when Caldonia Fackler Johnson opened that park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| two things happened that remind me of this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| The first thing is the city owned Cal Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| It owned that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| Cal Johnson took his own personal money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6897)|
| 1:55:01| and he who was a formerly enslaved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| when he was emancipated and he made all of his monies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| he believed that there should be a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| for children, colored children to play in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| And Knoxville did not have a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| for children, colored children to play in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| So when the city donated the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| which they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6920)|
| 1:55:21| he donated all of the money to then fill up the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6921)|
| 1:55:26| He donated the money for the water fountain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| the archway that went in the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| He don't, which we have no idea whatever happened to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| I've always tried to find that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| We have pictures of it, of course, at the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| but we can't find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| He donated the money for the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6938)|
| 1:55:39| the sidewalk, excuse me, the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| the maintenance, the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| And even, excuse me, as you mentioned about the maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| he donated the money for maintenance of that park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6947)|
| 1:55:50| his own personal money, not city money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| I'm very proud of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6953)|
| 1:55:54| because when you talk about the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| that someone who was formerly enslaved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| when emancipated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| made all of these wonderful money on his own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| but understood that our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| and our children deserve to have what every other child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| every other community deserves to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| And he was willing to invest his own money in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| I was very proud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| to read that part of the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6977)|
| 1:56:19| And I'm also very honored and proud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6979)|
| 1:56:21| that we would find someone today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| that would want to invest their money inside our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| so that our children, our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| our people who live in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| can enjoy the investment into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| And then nevermind, our greater community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| will come and find space and place there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=6998)|
| 1:56:41| And so I'm grateful for the infusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7001)|
| 1:56:44| of capital and investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| I think as much as we can invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| as much as we can invest in these communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| then we do good to all communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| When our community in East Knoxville is great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| all communities are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| So I thank the city council for understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7017)|
| 1:57:00| that it is also important naming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7020)|
| 1:57:03| I am clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7023)|
| 1:57:04| My intention, and I'm very intentional about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| is to create the Beck Cultural Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| particularly with the gateway being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| the Haley Heritage Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7031)|
| 1:57:12| where we really talk about our heritage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| and our roots with respect to history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| and how great our legacy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| We're going to tell that story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| And people are going to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7041)|
| 1:57:22| and have their family reunions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| Their children are going to play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7043)|
| 1:57:24| and they're going to hear about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7044)|
| 1:57:25| and read about this extraordinary history, Black history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| that's a part of the fabric of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| So I thank the mayor, I thank the vice mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| and I thank all of the city council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| who are looking at this project with close eyes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7056)|
| 1:57:39| understanding that the investment is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| We just want to make sure we get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| And I thank Blue Cross Blue Shield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| for their willingness to invest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| And so I'm very supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| Thank you so much, Reverend Kessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7069)|
| 1:57:53| I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7073)|
| 1:57:54| Council members, since there's been a few questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| raised about community engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| I would want to call on Charles Lomax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7080)|
| 1:58:03| my director of community empowerment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| who's been leading the engagement process on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7084)|
| 1:58:08| And I'd just like him to share a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| about what's been happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| and what will happen going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7091)|

| 1:58:15| Mr. Lomax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7095)|

| 1:58:17| Thank you, Mayor Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| Members of council, good to see you all this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| We were very mindful just of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| that we are in the middle of a pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7105)|
| 1:58:26| with our community engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| of how we went about doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| And so we opted to have a meeting of a few stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7110)|
| 1:58:35| that was held in the park itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| in open air and open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7117)|
| 1:58:38| And we invited representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| from four surrounding neighborhood associations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| to come and to be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| In addition to members and representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| of Mount Calvary Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| Mount Olive Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| which are across the street, Mount Olive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| and down the street, Mount Calvary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| as well as representatives from SEED| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| and from the Beck Center, Reverend Kessler was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7139)|
| 1:59:03| It was my omission with the Mabry-Hazen House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7143)|
| 1:59:06| and do offer apologies for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7146)|
| 1:59:10| I did make some phone calls and speak to individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| that did have some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| that were addressed after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| And we were grateful to have representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7160)|
| 1:59:23| that were present at this meeting as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| with some of the charts outlining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7165)|
| 1:59:28| what potentially the space could and would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7168)|
| 1:59:33| And from that, we were able to get some input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| from those that were present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| And that was the initial meeting that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7177)|
| 1:59:41| Thank you to Director Ely for her presence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| and for her being there from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7183)|
| 1:59:44| And our Office of Neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7184)|
| 1:59:47| was instrumental in that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| And so going forward, what we're looking at doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| once we get to this point is we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7192)|
| 1:59:55| that there will be more discussions to be had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| about the space and some of the customizable options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7200)|
| 2:00:01| And so we're looking to engage and embrace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| with the community to get their input on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7203)|
| 2:00:08| and how this can really take shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| to be an asset to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| For those that are longstanding residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| I myself grew up going to Morningside Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7215)|
| 2:00:17| lived down the street on Dandridge Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| and learned how to ride my bicycle there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7219)|
| 2:00:22| And we're really just looking forward to the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7222)|
| 2:00:27| that's gonna come along with this as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| And so there's still much more community conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| and engagement to be had as it relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| to this particular space and what it's gonna look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| Thank you, Mr. Lomax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| Council members, any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7242)|
| 2:00:45| Go ahead, Ms. Parker, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| Yeah, and it may be for Mr. Lomax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| which is why I wanted to jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| But I just wondered in the outreach efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| if any of our local festivals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7255)|
| 2:00:58| were included in those conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7258)|
| 2:00:59| because the Coomba Festival comes to mind for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| And I don't have a sense from the drawings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7263)|
| 2:01:06| how much of the park this would take up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7266)|
| 2:01:10| Also, the Frisbee golf has been popular at that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7270)|
| 2:01:15| Would it still allow for those amenities to move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| Or Dr. Lomax, either one, both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7278)|
| 2:01:25| I'll defer to Director Ely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7285)|
| 2:01:29| We have had conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7289)|
| 2:01:30| with the president of the disc golf community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7290)|
| 2:01:33| They know that there are a couple of holes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| that will need to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| They are aware that we'll have to make some changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7298)|
| 2:01:40| on those holes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| And that's only because they are already having issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7302)|
| 2:01:44| So we wanna address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7304)|
| 2:01:45| as we are looking at this part of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7305)|
| 2:01:48| I think the question you asked about the festivals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7308)|
| 2:01:50| we did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7310)|
| 2:01:50| One of the things that we wanted to make sure of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| is that that multipurpose fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7312)|
| 2:01:53| could still be used by all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| That meant we ask, and I guess the outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| when we talked to the neighborhood associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7318)|
| 2:02:01| that was one of the requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7321)|
| 2:02:02| is making sure that that field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7322)|
| 2:02:04| would have electricity and all those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7324)|
| 2:02:06| that if there was a festival there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7326)|
| 2:02:08| that it could happen and it could happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7328)|
| 2:02:10| without having to bring in different equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| for sound or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7334)|
| 2:02:15| So that was one of the ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7335)|
| 2:02:16| And so we did talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7336)|
| 2:02:19| And that was a request that came in from the stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7339)|
| 2:02:23| Thank you, Director Ely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| Any further questions, council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7347)|
| 2:02:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7349)|
| 2:02:30| I have every intention of voting yes on this gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| I appreciate the gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7352)|
| 2:02:34| I think it's going to be great for the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| and for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| Just the only point that I am stuck on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| just because that is normal process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7360)|
| 2:02:43| to name something after the gifter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7363)|
| 2:02:48| doesn't mean that it's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7368)|
| 2:02:50| You know, we have city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| I'm not going to go into other brands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| but that's the piece that I don't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7374)|
| 2:02:57| Is this an investment or is it a donation or is it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| you know, if you really want to have a healthy space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| toss around some health insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| then I'd be really good with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7389)|
| 2:03:12| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7392)|
| 2:03:15| I just had one more thought to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7395)|
| 2:03:19| that has left my brain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7399)|
| 2:03:21| and I'm going to recover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7401)|
| 2:03:24| I just wanted to ask in terms of this donation agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7404)|
| 2:03:31| if there is a timeline on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7411)|
| 2:03:34| since there were concerns from community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7414)|
| 2:03:37| that they were not aware of it until very recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7417)|
| 2:03:43| would there be any issue with delaying the vote on this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7423)|
| 2:03:50| so that community members could be brought up to speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| before we vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7433)|
| 2:03:59| Question for administration, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| Yeah, I think it's nice to move forward when the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7441)|
| 2:04:07| you know, this is what the community has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7447)|
| 2:04:10| We told the community that we're moving to Council tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| so we're bringing it to you for decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7453)|
| 2:04:16| There has been some community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7456)|
| 2:04:18| It hasn't maybe, it's not over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7458)|
| 2:04:21| You know, this is just midway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| through accepting the grant tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| will help Director Ely and Director Lomax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| move forward with more community engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| along with the donors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation and Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7474)|
| 2:04:37| So, you know, I think that it would benefit the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| to move forward and know that the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7480)|
| 2:04:43| and the people donating the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7483)|
| 2:04:45| are going to continue with the engagement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| So it's a positive experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| with the surrounding neighborhoods and churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7490)|
| 2:04:52| and the historical houses and museums nearby as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7492)|
| 2:04:58| Dr. David Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| Mayor, I did want to mention that it is, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7500)|
| 2:05:03| imperative that we move forward this because of COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7503)|
| 2:05:06| and some of the delays with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7506)|
| 2:05:09| we had an administration transition and COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7509)|
| 2:05:12| This has been delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7512)|
| 2:05:14| And so Ms. Johnson and Mr. Kang,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7514)|
| 2:05:15| I know are anxious to move this project forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7515)|
| 2:05:18| Also the timing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7518)|
| 2:05:20| from a construction standpoint will be important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7520)|
| 2:05:22| So it is time we would encourage a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7522)|
| 2:05:26| and to move this contract forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7526)|
| 2:05:28| and we can continue to work with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7528)|
| 2:05:29| on these improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| but also other improvements that Vice Mayor McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| mentioned that our Parks and Rec| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| and our public service team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| will be making in conjunction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7536)|
| 2:05:38| with the $5.5 million overall investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| One other question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7544)|
| 2:05:46| in terms of those conversations moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7546)|
| 2:05:51| we've learned that the sign is not up for negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7551)|
| 2:05:56| The size of it is not up for negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| Are the other elements of the project up for negotiation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7559)|
| 2:06:03| The location of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7563)|
| 2:06:05| whether there is a street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| whether there's a different access point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| are those all still a part of the conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7569)|
| 2:06:14| So Mayor, I could, so-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7574)|
| 2:06:16| Vice, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7576)|
| 2:06:17| Go ahead, Ms. Heland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7577)|
| 2:06:19| Basically right now, to be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| they have not been on site to really do their due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7581)|
| 2:06:25| So the layout right now could change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| That is something that we are aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| and we're trying to work through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7590)|
| 2:06:31| but they have not done anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| And that's Blue Cross Blue Shield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7593)|
| 2:06:34| as well as their contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7594)|
| 2:06:35| to come out to look at the engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| the geology, or any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| It's just, it was a plan that was placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7599)|
| 2:06:43| and we submitted it through Legacy Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7606)|
| 2:06:47| So there could be that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| of where it lays out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7610)|
| 2:06:51| Again, we don't have the final,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| what that plan would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| Yeah, I would say that the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| that you're reviewing tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7617)|
| 2:06:58| the base tenants of those concepts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7618)|
| 2:07:01| is what Blue Cross Blue Shield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| and the foundation have agreed upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7623)|
| 2:07:04| with the city and with Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| So of course there could be minor modifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7626)|
| 2:07:09| but what you're voting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7629)|
| 2:07:10| is this investment in the concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7630)|
| 2:07:12| And so there could be some minor changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| The access to that site was very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| The location was very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| But what you are voting on includes that concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7641)|
| 2:07:25| and the commitment to the signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| and to the foundation's investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7647)|
| 2:07:30| in this park space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7650)|
| 2:07:33| And if and when those changes do take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7653)|
| 2:07:36| we will do our due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7656)|
| 2:07:37| to reach out to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7657)|
| 2:07:38| to inform them and to keep them abreast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| of what's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7660)|
| 2:07:44| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7664)|
| 2:07:44| I do think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7664)|
| 2:07:46| I realize there are challenges with COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7666)|
| 2:07:48| but perhaps the Mary Hazen House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7668)|
| 2:07:55| and resident associations can self-organize a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7675)|
| 2:08:00| and the city can still prioritize them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| I just want to add that Morningside Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7689)|
| 2:08:14| is a park that is near and dear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7694)|
| 2:08:16| to the hearts of anyone who grew up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7696)|
| 2:08:18| in East Knoxville up to and including myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7698)|
| 2:08:21| Here in the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| this is a park that has been highly underutilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7703)|
| 2:08:28| other than the fact that Cumba started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7708)|
| 2:08:29| having the festivals there in the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7709)|
| 2:08:33| If you visit the park on any given day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| you will scarcely see anyone utilizing that park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7715)|
| 2:08:39| for multiple reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| There is some work that needs to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| to the park to make some improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| And so for Legacy Parks to have submitted this grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7725)|
| 2:08:50| along with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7730)|
| 2:08:51| and been awarded this amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7731)|
| 2:08:54| to invest in the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7734)|
| 2:08:55| which I think will provide more access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7735)|
| 2:08:59| and accessibility for people to want to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| and enjoy the park again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7741)|
| 2:09:03| as they once did many, many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7743)|
| 2:09:06| I think is phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7746)|
| 2:09:07| I think it's actually going to provide a better space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7747)|
| 2:09:11| even when we talk about festivals such as Cumba.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| Hopefully it will encourage other festivals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| to be held there in Morningside Park as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| Again, this is a huge improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| into an East Knoxville Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| that very well deserves this amount of attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7763)|
| 2:09:28| and investment in the park as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7768)|
| 2:09:29| And so while we may have issues with the signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7769)|
| 2:09:34| as far as the size of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7774)|
| 2:09:36| I do think that the benefits far will outweigh that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7776)|
| 2:09:39| Again, the community will stay engaged on this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7779)|
| 2:09:42| as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7782)|
| 2:09:45| And I'm in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7785)|
| 2:09:46| I think that I made a motion and got in a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7786)|
| 2:09:48| and I would like if there's no more further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7788)|
| 2:09:51| for us to move forward on a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| on this particular item tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7796)|
| 2:09:57| I don't see any further hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7797)|
| 2:10:00| without seeing any further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7800)|
| 2:10:02| Mr. Johnson, would you please conduct a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7802)|
| 2:10:04| Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7804)|
| 2:10:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7806)|
| 2:10:07| Councilwoman Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7809)|
| 2:10:10| Councilman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7810)|
| 2:10:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| Councilman Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7815)|
| 2:10:16| Councilwoman Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7816)|
| 2:10:19| Sorry, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7819)|
| 2:10:22| Councilman Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7822)|
| 2:10:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7823)|

| 2:11:43| Okay, motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| Council, I'd like to call for a 10-minute recess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| since we've been meeting for a little over two hours now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| So let's reconvene at 8.22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7910)|
| 2:11:53| We're back and we're ready to start section we're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7913)|
| 2:11:59| 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| So Mr. Johnson, if you could read the item 12A for us, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7922)|
| 2:12:06| 12A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7926)|
| 2:12:10| Chapter 12, to clarify flooding regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7930)|
| 2:12:12| and to remove certain unnecessary language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7932)|
| 2:12:17| Is there a motion on item 12A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7937)|
| 2:12:18| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7938)|
| 2:12:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7939)|
| 2:12:20| Motion made by Councilwoman Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7940)|
| 2:12:22| seconded by Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7942)|
| 2:12:24| Any discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7944)|
| 2:12:26| Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| Could I just ask Director Cannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7948)|
| 2:12:29| will this impact any of the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7949)|
| 2:12:32| or is this just a wording change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7952)|
| 2:12:37| Mr. Cannon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7957)|
| 2:12:39| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7959)|
| 2:12:39| Harold Cannon, Director of Engineering, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7959)|
| 2:12:42| Councilwoman Ryder, there are no changes to the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7962)|
| 2:12:47| It is a little bit more than wordsmithing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7967)|
| 2:12:49| And I want to commend my staff for coming up with these ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7969)|
| 2:12:53| I get to be the spokesperson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7973)|
| 2:12:54| but they're the ones who initiated them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| specifically Chris Howley and David McGinley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7977)|
| 2:13:00| There is some wordsmithing to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| some simplification of a language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| as well as new terminology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7986)|
| 2:13:07| that FEMA is asking us to incorporate into both A and B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7987)|
| 2:13:12| And I'll speak to both of these with your permission, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7992)|
| 2:13:16| The second component to this is we have simplified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=7996)|
| 2:13:21| for lack of a better term, the check writing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8001)|
| 2:13:24| There would be a submittal fee made to engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8004)|
| 2:13:27| But as each of you are aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| there are times that documents have to be recorded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8008)|
| 2:13:32| whether it's homeowner's association documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8012)|
| 2:13:35| or things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8015)|
| 2:13:36| that the submitter would be writing a separate check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8016)|
| 2:13:41| for that to another department within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8021)|
| 2:13:45| And yet they'd end up writing a check to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| We'd have to tell them, no, we need another check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| They were losing three to four weeks in that transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8030)|
| 2:13:54| So now you will see a change in fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8034)|
| 2:13:56| not increasing our fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8036)|
| 2:13:58| but merely allowing us to take care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| of that recording for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8040)|
| 2:14:02| and saving probably three to four weeks in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8042)|
| 2:14:06| The last one is one that is probably near and dear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8046)|
| 2:14:09| to my heart just from work on the Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8049)|
| 2:14:12| And that is right now, I believe everyone is aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| there's a grandfather clause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| for development within flood zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| that as long as you do not cross a 50% threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8059)|
| 2:14:23| as far as the value of that specific business or building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8063)|
| 2:14:29| that you don't have to bring the finished floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| and all those things up to the current flood elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8072)|
| 2:14:37| Right now today, the person who owns that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8077)|
| 2:14:41| that 50% is good once and forever and ever, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8081)|
| 2:14:46| And then they would have to tear the building down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| and raise it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8088)|
| 2:14:49| Under this scenario, and it is allowed by FEMA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| and encouraged by FEMA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| that we have set a five-year threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8095)|
| 2:14:59| where at the end of five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| basically the value is reset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| and they could do another up to 50%, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| This is pretty significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8108)|
| 2:15:11| My concern has been on the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8111)|
| 2:15:14| but by the way it was written before currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| we could unintentionally be creating blighted areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8118)|
| 2:15:21| This gives owners of those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| the opportunity to continue investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| but at the same time not play the phasing game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8125)|
| 2:15:28| submit something one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8128)|
| 2:15:29| and then the next year they submit another phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| and another phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8131)|
| 2:15:32| There is a five-year window that has to be honed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8132)|
| 2:15:36| Long explanation Councilwoman Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8136)|
| 2:15:38| I hope I answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8138)|
| 2:15:41| No, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8141)|
| 2:15:42| It will impact development and speed up the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8142)|
| 2:15:48| Thank you, Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8148)|
