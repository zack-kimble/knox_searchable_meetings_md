| 2:53:37| and whatever addendums are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10417)|
| 2:53:41| Going with me to this meeting is the district manager and the sales manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10421)|
| 2:53:48| and we're going to go meet with somebody in County Purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10428)|
| 2:53:51| All three of us have to register as a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10431)|
| 2:53:54| Mr. King, your five minutes is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10434)|
| 2:53:57| Mr. Lambert, I think you were going to move that we give him a little more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10437)|
| 2:54:01| How much more time would you like to give him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10441)|
| 2:54:03| How much more time do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10443)|
| 2:54:05| I'll give him about another three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10445)|
| 2:54:08| Another three minutes will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10448)|
| 2:54:10| We'll grant the three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10450)|
| 2:54:13| All three of those people have to register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10453)|
| 2:54:15| It's not just registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10455)|
| 2:54:17| Now they get to start filing reports in addition to that that are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10457)|
| 2:54:22| I'll give you one last example, and I am going to quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10462)|
| 2:54:26| No, I'm not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10466)|
| 2:54:29| MPC has a meeting monthly with subdivision meetings with developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10469)|
| 2:54:36| and their engineers, surveyors, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10476)|
| 2:54:39| and they invite them to come up to meet with them to discuss problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10479)|
| 2:54:42| and things that may be able to change on their plan and this, that, and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10482)|
| 2:54:46| They've got to register, not because it's something they voluntarily did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10486)|
| 2:54:49| They got invited to come be a part of a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10489)|
| 2:54:51| Now they've got to go register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10491)|
| 2:54:54| The last thing I'm going to mention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10494)|
| 2:54:56| if you read the section that says who doesn't have to register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10496)|
| 2:55:00| I raised the question under item number C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10500)|
| 2:55:04| These people don't have to register among the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10504)|
| 2:55:08| Representatives of citizens group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10508)|
| 2:55:11| Representative is not a defined term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10511)|
| 2:55:13| Is that a lawyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10513)|
| 2:55:14| If citizen group hires a lawyer, does he still have to register as a lobbyist or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10514)|
| 2:55:19| I would submit to you maybe he does, maybe he doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10519)|
| 2:55:22| He may not be a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10522)|
| 2:55:24| It's hard to tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10524)|
| 2:55:26| This ordinance is replete with those kind of examples and present those kind of problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10526)|
| 2:55:31| and I haven't done much more than scratch the surface on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10531)|
| 2:55:35| I suggest to you it bears your serious reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10535)|
| 2:55:38| because as you've heard me say many times, stand right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10538)|
| 2:55:42| it's the law of unintended consequence that will produce your first problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10542)|
| 2:55:47| That's what this one is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10547)|
| 2:55:51| Commissioner Lambert, you did have your line on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10551)|
| 2:55:53| Did you wish to speak on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10553)|
| 2:55:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10554)|
| 2:55:55| I'm not going to give a big long speech about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| I'm against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10557)|
| 2:55:59| I think that in a legislative body this size and in a town this size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10559)|
| 2:56:03| we all know who the lobbyists are and who they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10563)|
| 2:56:09| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10569)|
| 2:56:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10571)|
| 2:56:12| I don't want to give a long speech either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10572)|
| 2:56:14| I think everyone is aware of the ordinance and what it does and doesn't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10574)|
| 2:56:18| We've talked about it at great length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10578)|
| 2:56:20| I would just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10580)|
| 2:56:22| If you are a lobbyist and you are hired to go to Nashville to lobby the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10582)|
| 2:56:27| you must register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10587)|
| 2:56:29| And if you've been to Nashville lately, you know that there are lots of lobbyists in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10589)|
| 2:56:34| I mean, they are making a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10594)|
| 2:56:35| They are complying with the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10595)|
| 2:56:38| Maybe they have a problem with the registration, but they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10598)|
| 2:56:42| But they're able to make a living and they're able to go and represent their clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10602)|
| 2:56:46| If you go to Washington, D.C., and you are hired to attempt to influence a member of Congress on a bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10606)|
| 2:56:54| you must register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| And if you've been to Washington or you talk to folks who are in Washington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10616)|
| 2:56:59| you know that there is no shortage of lobbyists in Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10619)|
| 2:57:02| They know what the rules are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10622)|
| 2:57:04| They know that they must comply with certain procedures and paperwork and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10624)|
| 2:57:08| They do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10628)|
| 2:57:09| They make a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10629)|
| 2:57:10| And there is no shortage of lobbyists in Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10630)|
| 2:57:14| If you go to Metro Nashville and attempt to lobby, influence, one of the members of the Metro Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10634)|
| 2:57:23| or a member of the Metro government, you must register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10643)|
| 2:57:27| And this is what this is patterned after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10647)|
| 2:57:29| And they will tell you in Nashville there is no shortage of people in Nashville who try to lobby the Metro government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10649)|
| 2:57:35| They know the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10655)|
| 2:57:37| They comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10657)|
| 2:57:38| And they make a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10658)|
| 2:57:40| And they represent their clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10660)|
| 2:57:42| So I would just simply say that this is a matter of transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10662)|
| 2:57:46| I'm not sure where the newspaper got the fact that it was aimed at three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10666)|
| 2:57:50| That's certainly not the intent to be aimed at any one individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10670)|
| 2:57:52| It's aimed at anyone who wants to attempt to influence this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10672)|
| 2:57:58| or this government for a vote on behalf of a client, and they are paid to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10678)|
| 2:58:04| So I would just submit to you that this is nothing new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10684)|
| 2:58:08| This is done every day in Nashville, in Metro Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10688)|
| 2:58:11| It's done every day in Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10691)|
| 2:58:13| The people comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10693)|
| 2:58:14| They know what the rules are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10694)|
| 2:58:16| Nashville has told us, they told Mr. Lockett, they've had no problems with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10696)|
| 2:58:20| Initially there was a little angst because people were saying, oh, well, you know, we don't want to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10700)|
| 2:58:25| and maybe there are some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10705)|
| 2:58:27| But they comply, and they make a living, and they move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10707)|
| 2:58:30| And so I would just say to you that this is just another way for us to be transparent in our government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10710)|
| 2:58:36| and I would ask that you vote in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10716)|
| 2:58:41| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10721)|
| 2:58:43| Commissioner Hammond, what's the registration fee for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10723)|
| 2:58:48| There is no registration fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10728)|
| 2:58:50| There is no registration fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10730)|
| 2:58:52| When these lobbyists in Nashville register in Washington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10732)|
| 2:58:57| every time they represent a client they've got to go re-register?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10737)|
| 2:59:01| If you pick up a new client, yes, you'll have five days to fill out your form and say, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10741)|
| 2:59:05| I've picked up a client and this is the person that I'm going to be lobbying and trying to influence your vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10745)|
| 2:59:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10749)|
| 2:59:10| Well, you know, I've seen it here, and I'm sure you have before, that you've seen some of these lawyers come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10750)|
| 2:59:16| I'm not going to call them lobbyists because I do think they are lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10756)|
| 2:59:19| Come up and they'll make a statement, you know, my client can't be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10759)|
| 2:59:24| but he called me on the phone and asked me to represent him two days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10764)|
| 2:59:31| So, you know, that does pose a problem, this five-day deal, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10771)|
| 2:59:38| And I don't mind them registering as lobbyists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10778)|
| 2:59:41| but I don't think they need to register to represent everybody every time they pick up a client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10781)|
| 2:59:45| Because if I came before this board, I certainly wouldn't, and I'm a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10785)|
| 2:59:50| and know a little bit about the law, but I would be hunting one of these lawyers to represent me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10790)|
| 2:59:55| if I come up here and was trying to get something through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10795)|
| 2:59:59| because I don't know enough about the law, and I'm a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10799)|
| 3:00:03| Mr. Pengson, I have no problem increasing that to ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10803)|
| 3:00:08| Are you willing to change your motion to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10808)|
| 3:00:10| I'll change the motion to approve and increase the time frame to ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10810)|
| 3:00:17| Does the second agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10817)|
| 3:00:20| Who seconded that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10820)|
| 3:00:22| I did, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10822)|
| 3:00:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10824)|
| 3:00:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10825)|
| 3:00:26| What if the case comes up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10826)|
| 3:00:28| What I'm saying is, can he represent me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10828)|
| 3:00:32| If a guy calls him two days before that, he can't represent him even with the ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10832)|
| 3:00:36| He could represent him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10836)|
| 3:00:37| He would just have ten days to file his paper with the court clerk to say, I've picked up this client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10837)|
| 3:00:43| I mean, they could still do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10843)|
| 3:00:44| He just has ten days to file, or they have ten days to file, whoever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10844)|
| 3:00:48| I understand that, but what I'm saying is, Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10848)|
| 3:00:53| what if this client calls him Thursday, and here he is up here today trying to represent him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10853)|
| 3:01:00| That's not ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10860)|
| 3:01:01| Well, the way it's drafted, Commissioner Pengston, I think there was some concern that what if, for example, a client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10861)|
| 3:01:15| let's say someone was here lobbying on behalf of a client that they had been here for some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10875)|
| 3:01:22| and a citizen showed up and wanted to retain them on the spot that night and ask that a matter be continued or that they represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10882)|
| 3:01:31| The way it's drafted is they could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10891)|
| 3:01:36| It's just that when they accept the retention, then they have to file within whatever number of days the commission decides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10896)|
| 3:01:45| The way it's drafted now, it's five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10905)|
| 3:01:47| If it's changed to ten, then it just means that it has to be filed within ten days of being retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10907)|
| 3:01:54| But it doesn't mean that within that ten-day period they can't take any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10914)|
| 3:01:59| They can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10919)|
| 3:02:01| Maybe I misunderstood Mr. King, but I thought he read there that they had to have a proof letter before he could represent them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10921)|
| 3:02:08| before he could even be authorized to represent them with a clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10928)|
| 3:02:13| Mine was a very specific example, and it was based on the five days where you have a period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10933)|
| 3:02:18| when I'm supposed to be before this body representing them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10938)|
| 3:02:22| and I don't yet have their confirmation, if you will, their written authority for me to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10942)|
| 3:02:31| But every example you can come up with just produces another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10951)|
| 3:02:37| Extending it to ten days is fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10957)|
| 3:02:41| but again, what you're doing is you're putting us in a situation where I've got, let's say, the same circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10961)|
| 3:02:50| I get that call, and now I've got ten days to file it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10970)|
| 3:02:57| but when the day comes that I'm supposed to be in front of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10977)|
| 3:03:00| I still don't have a written proof of my authority to lobby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10980)|
| 3:03:08| and now what they're saying is it'll be okay if I get it in in ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10988)|
| 3:03:14| So you're really asking somebody to stand up here and run the risk of doing the lobbying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10994)|
| 3:03:21| doing the work before this body on the hope and expectation that that letter's going to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11001)|
| 3:03:26| and if it doesn't, you just theoretically are in violation of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11006)|
| 3:03:31| And I suggest to you, yes, they register in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11011)|
| 3:03:38| and they spent years getting it done right, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11018)|
| 3:03:43| and I assume they've done the same thing in Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11023)|
| 3:03:47| And I'm not saying that if you want to have lawyers and or others register as lobbyists, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11027)|
| 3:03:55| Then do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11035)|
| 3:03:56| But at least you can do it in a fashion where you don't have these kind of problems permeating what we're doing about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11036)|
| 3:04:06| number one, who really is it that's supposed to register?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11046)|
| 3:04:10| And then, you know, how do we go from there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11050)|
| 3:04:15| Who is it that is in charge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11055)|
| 3:04:19| You get to the end of this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11059)|
| 3:04:30| the last thing it says before when it's going to take effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11070)|
| 3:04:34| any violation of this chapter shall be punished by imposition of a civil penalty of not more than $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11074)|
| 3:04:41| Who seeks it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11081)|
| 3:04:43| How do they seek it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11083)|
| 3:04:47| Anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11087)|
| 3:04:48| You know, if you say anyone can, does that mean somebody out in the general public can, in some fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11088)|
| 3:04:55| pursue to have that civil penalty invoked against somebody who appeared here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11095)|
| 3:05:00| and they weren't even involved in the particular issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11100)|
| 3:05:03| Mr. Law Director, could you answer that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11103)|
| 3:05:09| This county code provides that whenever this code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11109)|
| 3:05:14| or any ordinance of the county prohibits a specific act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11114)|
| 3:05:17| or an act is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11117)|
| 3:05:21| or whenever this code or an ordinance requires the doing of any act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11121)|
| 3:05:24| or declares that the failure to do any act will be unlawful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11124)|
| 3:05:27| and no specific penalty is provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11127)|
| 3:05:29| therefore the violation of this code or any such ordinance shall be punished by a civil penalty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11129)|
| 3:05:35| of not more than $1,000 for each separate violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11135)|
| 3:05:38| Provided, however, that the imposition of a fine under this code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11138)|
| 3:05:41| or any ordinance of the county shall not prevent the revocation of any permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11141)|
| 3:05:45| or license for a code or ordinance violation where it called for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11145)|
| 3:05:49| or permitted under the provisions of this code or of any ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11149)|
| 3:05:53| The General Sessions Court shall fix the amount of any fine to be levied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11153)|
| 3:05:56| under the provisions of this section as his discretion may dictate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11156)|
| 3:06:01| Each day that any violation of any ordinance continues shall constitute a separate offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11161)|
| 3:06:07| So the civil penalty provision would be go before General Sessions Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11167)|
| 3:06:13| and if there was a decision made that-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11173)|
| 3:06:16| Initiated by whom, I believe, was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11176)|
| 3:06:19| Who would have to file or start the proceedings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11179)|
| 3:06:23| Right now, the way it would be done is under other provisions of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11183)|
| 3:06:29| It's done by the law enforcement for Knox County, and that would be the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11189)|
| 3:06:35| TCA 5-1-211.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11195)|
| 3:06:38| And that's what it says, is that the chief law enforcement officer does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11198)|
| 3:06:46| Well, this business then about filing sworn complaints is lost on me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11206)|
| 3:06:55| as to why that's even in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11215)|
| 3:06:58| It's just another issue or another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11218)|
| 3:07:03| And-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11223)|
| 3:07:08| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11228)|
| 3:07:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11232)|
| 3:07:13| Thank you, Commissioner Hammond, for bringing this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11233)|
| 3:07:16| It is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11236)|
| 3:07:18| I think this is just another way that we can go about, as you said, making our-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11238)|
| 3:07:23| Oops, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11243)|
| 3:07:24| Our government more transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11244)|
| 3:07:27| I think this has worked extremely well in Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11247)|
| 3:07:32| I don't see any problem with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11252)|
| 3:07:35| I'm in full support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11255)|
| 3:07:41| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11261)|
| 3:07:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11263)|
| 3:07:45| I find myself in an extremely unusual position of agreeing with Lumpy, so I'm-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11265)|
| 3:07:53| Spreading lightly here, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11273)|
| 3:07:55| Be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11275)|
| 3:07:56| You all bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11276)|
| 3:07:57| He's out in the audience lobbying right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11277)|
| 3:08:00| Dr. Briggs, did you bring a thermometer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11280)|
| 3:08:02| Hey, I get more votes out here than I do up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11282)|
| 3:08:06| But in all seriousness, my issue isn't with this particular thing, although I do think it's overkill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11286)|
| 3:08:16| I think in Knox County it's overkill because I don't know why they came up with three people named,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11296)|
| 3:08:25| well, I guess four with Moxley Carmichael Thorn in there, but that's pretty much all it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11305)|
| 3:08:30| So it's not an issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11310)|
| 3:08:32| But with that said, we want to, again, show ourselves even more open and honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11312)|
| 3:08:40| My charge and my challenge to this body is to come up with a point when we say when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11320)|
| 3:08:49| When is enough enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11329)|
| 3:08:50| Every month, in my opinion, someone's trying to one-up and continue on and let's do even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11330)|
| 3:08:59| And, again, I think we're at a good spot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11339)|
| 3:09:05| We can take this thing beyond the tipping point and we find ourselves ineffective and not able to do business and serve our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11345)|
| 3:09:20| Again, is this one okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11360)|
| 3:09:22| If this one passes, it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11362)|
| 3:09:24| But, again, I challenge us to let's slow this wave down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11364)|
| 3:09:30| Black Friday was terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11370)|
| 3:09:32| It really was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11372)|
| 3:09:33| It was a dark day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11373)|
| 3:09:35| Black Wednesday, I'm sorry, was a dark day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11375)|
| 3:09:38| But we have come a long, long way since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11378)|
| 3:09:42| And, again, we keep seeing these things crop up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11382)|
| 3:09:45| Okay, let's do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11385)|
| 3:09:47| It's like we sit and we dream of this and we wake up in the morning and say I've got another resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11387)|
| 3:09:52| And let's ordinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11392)|
| 3:09:54| So I'll just challenge us to if this one passes, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11394)|
| 3:09:58| But let's slow this down a little bit, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11398)|
| 3:10:04| Commissioner Lambert, you did have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11404)|
| 3:10:05| You turned it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11405)|
| 3:10:06| Did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11406)|
| 3:10:07| No, I was going to offer a substitute motion, but I've changed my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11407)|
| 3:10:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11410)|
| 3:10:12| Commissioner Briggs, you had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11412)|
| 3:10:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11414)|
| 3:10:15| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11415)|
| 3:10:18| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11418)|
| 3:10:22| I agree with what Commissioner Hammond is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11422)|
| 3:10:27| I'm reading over this document, though, in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11427)|
| 3:10:29| And what we've got here is someone can come here, they can lobby, the deal's done, they walk out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11429)|
| 3:10:38| I still don't know they're a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11438)|
| 3:10:40| There's nothing to have been transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11440)|
| 3:10:42| It's all over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11442)|
| 3:10:43| The old saying goes where I come from, the cow's out of the barn, nobody's closed the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11443)|
| 3:10:48| And we've got all these hoops they've got to jump through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11448)|
| 3:10:51| And they've already left town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11451)|
| 3:10:54| Ten days later they register as a lobbyist, and I'm still wondering what it was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11454)|
| 3:10:59| I mean, we're looking back with the way this document is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11459)|
| 3:11:03| So I don't see any transparency there at all because the action is done by the time we get to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11463)|
| 3:11:09| So I think conceptually registering lobbyists is probably not a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11469)|
| 3:11:16| I'm not too sure that this document here is really the way we want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11476)|
| 3:11:20| I think we need to put some more thought in it, and I would rather kind of defer this thing at best by what I'm reading here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11480)|
| 3:11:29| The second thing is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11489)|
| 3:11:30| We could even come up with a way where if we're going to have lobbyists, then let's just register the lobbyists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11490)|
| 3:11:35| and let's do it like at the first of the year and we know who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11495)|
| 3:11:39| It's not like we've got 20,000 of them running around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11499)|
| 3:11:44| And most of the time when they stand up before us they say, you know, I'm XYZ and I'm here representing PDQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11504)|
| 3:11:50| And we know that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11510)|
| 3:11:52| And I kind of agree with Commissioner McKenzie on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11512)|
| 3:12:00| And I think we probably need to at least step back and look at what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11520)|
| 3:12:05| I think our heart's in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11525)|
| 3:12:08| I think what we're after is really generally a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11528)|
| 3:12:12| But I just really don't see, I really think this one is going to cause us more trouble than it's worth if we try to pass it like it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11532)|
| 3:12:21| Just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11541)|
| 3:12:22| I think it's really going to cause us more trouble than it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11542)|
| 3:12:25| And I don't think we're going to gain that much for the public or the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11545)|
| 3:12:29| So at this point in time I'm really not leaning toward this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11549)|
| 3:12:33| If we could come up with a better structure, a better procedure, a better process where we could maybe do a one-time deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11553)|
| 3:12:40| and we know that, you know, Mr. King is going to be a lobbyist and he's going to represent these type of things, that might be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11560)|
| 3:12:46| But I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11566)|
| 3:12:48| That's my take on it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11568)|
| 3:12:50| If you make that in the form of a substitute motion, I would second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11570)|
| 3:12:54| I'll make it in the form of a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11574)|
| 3:12:56| And your motion being?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11576)|
| 3:12:59| That basically we defer this and try to come up with a better procedure or maybe a one-time registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11579)|
| 3:13:07| So you want to defer this for, what, 30 days, 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11587)|
| 3:13:10| Well, give the law department some way to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11590)|
| 3:13:13| I would really have a one-time. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11593)|
| 3:13:15| I would rather have a motion to have a one-time registration for lobbyists if we want to have some kind of transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11595)|
| 3:13:21| Yeah, that's what I thought you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11601)|
| 3:13:23| That would be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11603)|
| 3:13:25| And then we could let the law. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11605)|
| 3:13:26| So you're not. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11606)|
| 3:13:28| That would put us back on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11608)|
| 3:13:30| So it would have to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11610)|
| 3:13:31| We would have to come back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11611)|
| 3:13:33| So we can vote on your proposal tonight and then have it ready for the second reading because that would put us back to first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11613)|
| 3:13:40| Well, let me get this straight because I want to make sure everybody understands what your motion is before we would even vote on it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11620)|
| 3:13:48| You're asking to defer this so that we could come back with a different ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11628)|
| 3:13:56| Well, I'm thinking. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11636)|
| 3:13:57| Really what I'm thinking is. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11637)|
| 3:13:58| You're amending it to a one-time registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11638)|
| 3:14:01| I'm really. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11641)|
| 3:14:02| Or are you trying to just change the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11642)|
| 3:14:06| It would actually make it be a substantial change to where it would not be second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11646)|
| 3:14:11| It would be a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11651)|
| 3:14:15| Or is that what you're wanting to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11655)|
| 3:14:18| Please, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11658)|
| 3:14:20| I'm trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11660)|
| 3:14:21| Are you just asking for a deferral for a certain amount of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11661)|
| 3:14:24| Or are you wanting to make a substitute motion or change of this ordinance, which in my opinion, and I'll confer with the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11664)|
| 3:14:32| that it is a substantial change that it's no longer a second reading but a first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11672)|
| 3:14:38| My motion would probably be a substantial change to this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11678)|
| 3:14:41| So you're wanting to go ahead and make a substitute ordinance so that it would have to be first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11681)|
| 3:14:49| and that they would have to register, what, one time, January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11689)|
| 3:14:55| One time as a lobbyist in Knox County so that this body would recognize when people who are registered come before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11695)|
| 3:15:02| they're lobbyists, and that would make them transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11702)|
| 3:15:06| And they would be a lobbyist up front instead of after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11706)|
| 3:15:12| I mean, if a lot of lawyers come up here and they represent and leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11712)|
| 3:15:17| and then 10 days later we find out, oh, whoops, they were a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11717)|
| 3:15:20| Well, see, that doesn't tell me anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11720)|
| 3:15:23| Mr. Law Director, do you have enough direction to write an ordinance given that information that we could come back with a second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11723)|
| 3:15:33| Well, what it would, if I understand what Commissioner Armstrong is saying is this will shorten the ordinance substantially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11733)|
| 3:15:41| and all it will require is that we'll have to come up with, again, a definition of lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11741)|
| 3:15:48| But the only requirement will be that whoever meets that definition will just have to register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11748)|
| 3:15:56| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11756)|
| 3:15:58| And I would suggest, again, whatever the will of the body is, if that's the way you're going to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11758)|
| 3:16:04| that that registration be good for a specified period of time, maybe a year or something, and then it be refiled annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11764)|
| 3:16:16| And I do come again with some of the, I think some of the flaws that have actually been pointed out in reading this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11776)|
| 3:16:23| that if we're going to have any penalties related to it, if they don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11783)|
| 3:16:27| then we need to have a very strict procedure as to how we're going to address those penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11787)|
| 3:16:32| I would rather they address this to be a fallback position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11792)|
| 3:16:36| Instead of it just being that they register and it's good for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11796)|
| 3:16:39| shouldn't we just make it that it's for the calendar year and if they come in part way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11799)|
| 3:16:44| they know that it ends December 31st and come January they all just have to register again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11804)|
| 3:16:49| Or either our fiscal year, either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11809)|
| 3:16:52| You're the maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11812)|
| 3:16:54| You decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11814)|
| 3:16:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11815)|
| 3:16:56| I think the law director and I are on the same page at this point, kind of, and I'm going to make a motion that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11816)|
| 3:17:02| Well, let me say, for this, I want whatever is passed to meet legal muster and not be subject to a court challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11822)|
| 3:17:11| So if we're talking about having a substantial revision of the penalty provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11831)|
| 3:17:19| then what I'm going to recommend is that this matter be deferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11839)|
| 3:17:27| and that we come back with something in writing that is before you that you can look at the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11847)|
| 3:17:36| It will be first reading, I understand, and it will delay whatever action is going to be taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11856)|
| 3:17:42| but when we start changing it to this extent but we don't have the specifics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11862)|
| 3:17:50| it concerns me that you're voting on something that you really don't know what you're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11870)|
| 3:17:54| Mr. Law Director, would it be an appropriate motion if he asked for a deferral for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11874)|
| 3:18:00| to give you the time to write up what he wants to do as far as a substitute or a different ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11880)|
| 3:18:09| Sure, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11889)|
| 3:18:10| Is that what you're wanting to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11890)|
| 3:18:13| Well, that was my original. I was wanting it deferred 30 days so we really could come up with a better approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11893)|
| 3:18:17| So that you can get with the law director and have your idea proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11897)|
| 3:18:21| and then we could defer Commissioner Hammond's for 30 days and then we'd have the two ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11901)|
| 3:18:28| We'd have second reading on one or we can go first reading on the other. Is that what you're proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11908)|
| 3:18:35| It would be fine. I'm not trying to supersede any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11915)|
| 3:18:39| All right, I'm just trying to get clear where we're at. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11919)|
| 3:18:43| Commissioner Smith, your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11923)|
| 3:18:45| Yes, I'll just wait for the rewrite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11925)|
| 3:18:47| Okay. Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11927)|
| 3:18:51| Thank you. I think we're trying to throw the baby out with the bathwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11931)|
| 3:18:59| What is a lobbyist? A lobbyist is a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11939)|
| 3:19:01| What's an attorney? An attorney is a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11941)|
| 3:19:04| What is John Doe that comes up here and represents Mary Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11944)|
| 3:19:07| He is a representative. Maybe Mary doesn't feel like talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11947)|
| 3:19:11| Maybe she's deaf. He's her neighbor. He comes up and represents her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11951)|
| 3:19:14| He's got to register her as a lobbyist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11954)|
| 3:19:16| Why do we, you know, if anybody comes up here and representing somebody else, they're a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11956)|
| 3:19:22| What's the big deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11962)|
| 3:19:25| Are you done, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11965)|
| 3:19:28| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11968)|
| 3:19:29| Okay. Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11969)|
| 3:19:31| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11971)|
| 3:19:33| One of the things that sort of bothers me about this we keep saying comes up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11973)|
| 3:19:40| Do lobbyists only appear before us here at County Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11980)|
| 3:19:46| And I would submit that they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11986)|
| 3:19:51| I agree with Commissioner McKenzie, and I hate for us to be sitting on the same side as Commissioner Gregg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=11991)|
| 3:20:03| But I think it's important to note the fact that there are a lot of questions being raised by the new majority of County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12003)|
| 3:20:18| and that's the ten people that are now in County Commission that were not here a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12018)|
| 3:20:25| I believe that Knox County Commission holds itself to a lot higher standard than Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12025)|
| 3:20:34| and the legislature holds itself to there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12034)|
| 3:20:37| especially when we speak of Washington and how extremely strong monetary lobbying is in Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12037)|
| 3:20:52| I would submit to you that we don't really face that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12052)|
| 3:20:55| What we face as lobbyists is the fellow down at the crossroads wanting to get the sign changed on the corporation that he may be representing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12055)|
| 3:21:11| Now, that person is not a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12071)|
| 3:21:13| He's not standing maybe here, but he's asking me how I feel about his sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12073)|
| 3:21:21| Or let's not use the convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12081)|
| 3:21:25| Let me go to a different one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12085)|
| 3:21:28| The local assistant pastor at the Baptist Church is wanting to get his sign changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12088)|
| 3:21:34| If he gets a bigger sign, he gets a bigger crowd and he gets more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12094)|
| 3:21:39| He's a paid representative of the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12099)|
| 3:21:42| Is he a lobbyist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12102)|
| 3:21:44| And I don't think the one-time registration of lobbyists even comes anywhere speaking to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12104)|
| 3:21:55| Let me back up and say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12115)|
| 3:21:57| I believe that Knox County Commission is held to a lot higher standard than any other legislative body in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12117)|
| 3:22:08| I think we understand that, and I think that this set of regulations extremely limits our ability to exercise our ability to weigh things in perspective by making me think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12128)|
| 3:22:26| well, since I can't talk to my seatmate, now I can't listen to anyone try to influence me on what should take place at County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12146)|
| 3:22:37| So I believe I'm going to have an extreme amount of difficulty in dealing with anything that's going to cause people to have to register to explain to me how they feel about what ought to take place in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12157)|
| 3:22:55| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12175)|
| 3:22:58| And if you'll just keep in mind, we are running late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12178)|
| 3:23:01| If you could try to be as short and concise as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12181)|
| 3:23:04| I would support postponing this to do a little more research into it, although I don't think it's caused a problem in other places where it's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12184)|
| 3:23:16| And although this commission, I think, holds itself to a higher standard, that may not always be true in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12196)|
| 3:23:22| And when I came in on commission a few months ago, I didn't know who the lobbyists were or the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12202)|
| 3:23:31| You aren't given that information in orientation, and they didn't contribute to my campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12211)|
| 3:23:38| So that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12218)|
| 3:23:42| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12222)|
| 3:23:44| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12224)|
| 3:23:45| Commissioners, having lived through all of the travails of the last few years and few months, those of us who are here and who have lived through it, we, I guess, come at things from a different perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12225)|
| 3:23:58| A lot of work has gone into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12238)|
| 3:24:00| This hasn't been something that has been kind of roughshod, that was just thrown together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12240)|
| 3:24:03| I postponed this on three different occasions to make sure that we had the proper wording, that we had the proper procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12243)|
| 3:24:13| This is why we use Nashville as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12253)|
| 3:24:16| Mr. Lockett even went to Nashville personally, talked with the folks in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12256)|
| 3:24:20| My bottom line is, a lot of work has gone into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12260)|
| 3:24:23| If you're going to vote it down, then let's vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12263)|
| 3:24:26| Give me a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12266)|
| 3:24:27| If you don't want to do it, I can accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12267)|
| 3:24:29| I've been beaten before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12269)|
| 3:24:31| But the notion of, let's say, let's have one lobbying bill and let's compare it to another lobbying bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12271)|
| 3:24:38| And frankly, I feel like we're watering it down if we come in and say, well, let's just register once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12278)|
| 3:24:44| If you don't want it, vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12284)|
| 3:24:48| And then that way you can start from square one and go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12288)|
| 3:24:51| But I would just ask as a courtesy, give me a vote on it and let me vote it up or down rather than deferring it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12291)|
| 3:24:56| and trying to come up with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12296)|
| 3:24:58| I mean, if you vote it down, then somebody else can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12298)|
| 3:25:00| I mean, I'm not going to come back with another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12300)|
| 3:25:02| So maybe somebody else can come in with something if you choose to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12302)|
| 3:25:07| But with all the effort that's gone into this, I would just appreciate a vote up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12307)|
| 3:25:11| And if you vote it down, then I can go home and eat my hamburger and my glass of wine in peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12311)|
| 3:25:19| Are you inviting me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12319)|
| 3:25:20| I'd like a hamburger too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12320)|
| 3:25:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12321)|
| 3:25:22| We'll sunshine it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12322)|
| 3:25:24| First from Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12324)|
| 3:25:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12325)|
| 3:25:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12326)|
| 3:25:27| Those here who have taken a campaign contribution from King, Seymour, Valiant or Cynthia Moxley, hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12327)|
| 3:25:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12333)|
| 3:25:34| Any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12334)|
| 3:25:35| Or you just can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12335)|
| 3:25:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12336)|
| 3:25:37| See, that didn't hurt or it shouldn't hurt because this is about the public knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12337)|
| 3:25:42| As Commissioner Broyles said, you don't learn this at orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12342)|
| 3:25:45| They don't put this information out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12345)|
| 3:25:47| They don't put little brochures below us indicating who gave contributions, who's lobbying for whom, who the players are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12347)|
| 3:25:53| This is simply the public's knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12353)|
| 3:25:55| Commissioner Hammond researched this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12355)|
| 3:25:57| He went to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12357)|
| 3:25:59| He found out what worked in other communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12359)|
| 3:26:01| He does deserve what he just asked for, which is an up or down vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12361)|
| 3:26:04| Commissioner Armstrong, I understand your position, but there's an internal contradiction in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12364)|
| 3:26:09| You know, if you're talking about a yearly form, as you were earlier, think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12369)|
| 3:26:14| We have to wait ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12374)|
| 3:26:15| You complained about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12375)|
| 3:26:16| It happens and ten days later we find out about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12376)|
| 3:26:18| If we go to a yearly form, it happens 11 months later in some cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12378)|
| 3:26:22| Better to go with the workable form that we know works elsewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12382)|
| 3:26:26| and give Commissioner Hammond that up or down vote, have the courage to either stand for this or stand against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12386)|
| 3:26:32| but let's not do this defer, delay, deny tactics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12392)|
| 3:26:37| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12397)|
| 3:26:39| I just want to say one thing, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12399)|
| 3:26:41| A lot of these cases go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12401)|
| 3:26:44| So if I came up here, I would want a lawyer representing me because I would want him to be on the ground floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12404)|
| 3:26:50| Now, I realize he could come back and get the records and minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12410)|
| 3:26:52| but I wouldn't be wanting him to handle this for me, and I think the one-time registration is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12412)|
| 3:26:59| That's what I'll be voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12419)|
| 3:27:01| Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12421)|
| 3:27:03| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12423)|
| 3:27:04| How large is the Metro Commission, is it, or Metro Council in Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12424)|
| 3:27:12| They have 35 to 40 members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12432)|
| 3:27:15| Thirty-five to 40 members, and today we have 19, and in the future we may have nine representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12435)|
| 3:27:22| Eleven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12442)|
| 3:27:23| Eleven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12443)|
| 3:27:24| Eleven representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12444)|
| 3:27:26| A suit that's tailored for me is not necessarily going to fit Mr. Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12446)|
| 3:27:31| and a suit that's tailored for Harmon isn't necessarily going to fit me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12451)|
| 3:27:36| and I would challenge that a, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12456)|
| 3:27:41| ordinance that's drafted for Nashville or for the Statehouse or for Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12461)|
| 3:27:50| probably fits those large legislative bodies just fine, but I think it's too big for this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12470)|
| 3:27:57| I would have supported Mr. Armstrong's proposal had it came forward, but I'm going to vote against this one today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12477)|
| 3:28:05| And I call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12485)|
| 3:28:07| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12487)|
| 3:28:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12488)|
| 3:28:09| We do have one light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12489)|
| 3:28:14| I retract my call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12494)|
| 3:28:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12496)|
| 3:28:17| Mr. Armstrong, if you'll keep it short for us, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12497)|
| 3:28:19| I'll keep it short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12499)|
| 3:28:22| The point of the one-year, meaning you register one time, is you register in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12502)|
| 3:28:27| This has you registering after the fact, so I think we're a little skewed on the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12507)|
| 3:28:33| but if we would like to, I have no problem giving the courtesy to Commissioner Hammond for his vote on his issue tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12513)|
| 3:28:40| if that's the will of this body, and I think it's only fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12520)|
| 3:28:44| He did do a lot of work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12524)|
| 3:28:47| That's up to Mr. McKenzie on my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12527)|
| 3:28:49| Are you withdrawing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12529)|
| 3:28:51| I'll withdraw subject to Mr. McKenzie, and I'll be voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12531)|
| 3:28:57| The second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12537)|
| 3:28:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12539)|
| 3:29:00| Well, we're back to the original motion, except it was changed to the 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12540)|
| 3:29:04| Roll call to him, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12544)|
| 3:29:06| That's what I was going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12546)|
| 3:29:08| We're going to roll call, starting at First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12548)|
| 3:29:12| You're all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12552)|
| 3:29:14| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12554)|
| 3:29:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12555)|

| 3:30:21| Do we have any other business before we go to public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12621)|
| 3:30:27| All right, public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12627)|
| 3:30:29| We had a Roy Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12629)|
| 3:30:33| Is he here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12633)|
| 3:30:36| I saw George Hamilton leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12636)|
| 3:30:38| Did he come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12638)|
| 3:30:42| And I know I'm going to butcher these names, but Tom Driscoll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12642)|
| 3:30:48| Sir, you've got five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12648)|
| 3:30:50| If you'll identify yourself by name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12650)|
| 3:30:54| Before he starts, I just want to say if the folks that signed up to speak are watching this on television,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12654)|
| 3:31:01| feel free to give me a call at 454-4961.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12661)|

| 3:31:57| Definitions Declaration of Nuisance and Defenses, Abandoned Motor Vehicles and Inoperable Motor Vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12717)|
| 3:32:06| And it talks about what they are, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12726)|
| 3:32:10| And then it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12730)|
| 3:32:12| This section shall not apply to any motor vehicle on private property which is not visible from the street or from other public or private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12732)|
| 3:32:22| comma, if the motor vehicle is completely enclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12742)|
| 3:32:26| At that comma, that's where it stops to say that this section shall not apply to any motor vehicle on private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12746)|
| 3:32:34| which is not visible from the street or from other public or private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12754)|
| 3:32:39| Okay, with that in mind, on November 21, 2008, Grant Rosenberg and Jack Paul, the inspector, came to my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12759)|
| 3:32:48| My mother and her husband and myself all had a conversation about the vehicles that belonged to my children and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12768)|
| 3:32:55| Grant Rosenberg and Jack Paul were there on two earlier occasions and all conversations were openly audio recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12775)|
| 3:33:04| I received a citation to court for violation of Knox County Ordinance 5-22-02 on November 21, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12784)|
| 3:33:16| I explained to Grant Rosenberg and Jack Paul that all my vehicles that were recently registered did not have the tags on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12796)|
| 3:33:24| because of ongoing theft of things like batteries, radiators, catalytic converters and some scrap aluminum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12804)|
| 3:33:31| A lot of thieves in the neighborhood. That's what they do for a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12811)|
| 3:33:36| I didn't want to have any of my tags stolen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12816)|
| 3:33:39| So I showed him the stack of new tags and the folder of new registrations right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12819)|
| 3:33:46| When we went to court on January 27, 2009, Grant Rosenberg stated under oath that they came by my property the day before court on January 26, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12826)|
| 3:33:57| But evidently they decided not to take any up-to-date pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12837)|
| 3:34:02| Instead, he brought 65-day-old pictures as evidence, which was not an accurate picture of my property on the day of the court hearing, which is false information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12842)|
| 3:34:17| I received a letter dated February 3, 2009 that said in general that Knox County would be coming to my property on February 18, 2009 to take inoperable vehicles into custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12857)|
| 3:34:32| That didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12872)|
| 3:34:34| Instead, on February 25, 2009, a week later, two employees of Knox County Sheriff's Department came to my property around 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12874)|
| 3:34:44| and arrested me for Jefferson County Sheriff's Department because of an 11-year-old capious for not paying a fine and court costs for a driver's license problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12884)|
| 3:34:57| Less than 10 minutes after I was handcuffed and locked in the back of the Knox County Sheriff's Department car, two cars and three car hauling trucks came up my driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12897)|
| 3:35:09| I think Grant Rosenberg didn't like my tape recorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12909)|
| 3:35:14| In the back corner of my property, my children and I built an eight-foot tall security fence of galvanized corrugated sheet metal around an area approximately 80 feet by 80 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12914)|
| 3:35:27| to secure most of our personal property from theft, including 11 vehicles and four utility trailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12927)|
| 3:35:34| We're all enclosed in an 80-by-80-foot fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12934)|
| 3:35:40| One section was open, about 15 foot was open, so I could keep putting the rest of the stuff in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12940)|
| 3:35:45| It was framed, but it didn't have the sheet metal on it because I hadn't had time to build an actual gate or a door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12945)|
| 3:35:52| Later on the night of February 25, 2009, when I paid off Jefferson County Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12952)|
| 3:35:58| Sir, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12958)|
| 3:36:00| I went to my property at 609 Quorum Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12960)|
| 3:36:03| There was a 30-foot section of the east wall of our security fence torn out and 11 of my vehicles were missing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12963)|
| 3:36:09| including three antique vehicles that were registered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12969)|
| 3:36:12| A friend of mine has a nephew who has some old cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12972)|
| 3:36:16| He was told by someone from the codes enforcement office that he could keep the cars if he built a fence around them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12976)|
| 3:36:24| which brings me back to the abandoned and operated vehicles definitions that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12984)|
| 3:36:32| to any motor vehicle on private property which is not visible from the street or from other public or private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12992)|
| 3:36:39| That means you're allowed to have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=12999)|
| 3:36:41| Grant Rosenberg decided I wasn't allowed to have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13001)|
| 3:36:44| And on the other occasions that he was at my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13004)|
| 3:36:48| he's talked a lot of false statements and other things that I've got on tape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13008)|
| 3:36:56| and I will be getting it printed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13016)|
| 3:37:00| I hate to file a lawsuit because I hate to cost the county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13020)|
| 3:37:05| But I've been ignored in court before, but I'll have to have me a good lawyer, probably one from New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13025)|
| 3:37:11| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13031)|
| 3:37:12| Are you done, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13032)|
| 3:37:13| Yes. Anybody got any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13033)|
| 3:37:16| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13036)|
| 3:37:17| I just wanted to wish you luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13037)|
| 3:37:18| This is not a matter that this commission can act on, but of course you do have the civil courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13038)|
| 3:37:24| and I just wanted to wish you luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13044)|
| 3:37:26| Yes, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13046)|
| 3:37:27| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13047)|
| 3:37:28| I just want to let everybody know what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13048)|
| 3:37:30| I just want everybody to be aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13050)|
| 3:37:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13052)|
| 3:37:33| That's where I'm starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13053)|
| 3:37:34| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13054)|
| 3:37:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13055)|
| 3:37:36| Grant, would you like to respond or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13056)|
| 3:37:39| You don't have to if you don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13059)|
| 3:37:49| Remember, you don't have to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13069)|
| 3:37:52| I'll just say, you know, this matter's been before the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13072)|
| 3:37:55| It's been to General Sessions' court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13075)|
| 3:37:57| It does not need to be in front of this body here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13077)|
| 3:38:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13081)|
| 3:38:04| All right, well, we're going to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13084)|
| 3:38:08| Okay, sir, we're going to move on, but thank you for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13088)|
| 3:38:13| Joe, and I'm not even going to attempt, if you'll say your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13093)|
| 3:38:20| Joe Minichiello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13100)|
| 3:38:21| Minichiello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13101)|
| 3:38:22| Minichiello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13102)|
| 3:38:23| Little Fiddle is how I have people try and remember it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13103)|
| 3:38:28| My name is Joe Minichiello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13108)|
| 3:38:29| I live at 311 Lindy Drive in South Knoxville, and I know it's late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13109)|
| 3:38:34| so I'm going to be very brief so you'll listen to me more precisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13114)|
| 3:38:38| I just want to make an editorial comment on the resolution on the top of page 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13118)|
| 3:38:44| This has to deal with the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13124)|
| 3:38:47| I've been before the MPC on this and some of the commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13127)|
| 3:38:50| My point with this is Helen Ross McNabb Center came to the old severe neighborhood about four or five months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13130)|
| 3:39:01| and presented a position or a project to the neighborhood with the attitude that this is it, you have to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13141)|
| 3:39:09| Well, partly due to the commission withholding or deferring this grant money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13149)|
| 3:39:15| they reconsidered their position and came back to the old severe neighborhood group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13155)|
| 3:39:21| I think it was last month at a meeting that I attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13161)|
| 3:39:25| and for those of you who subscribe to the KNS saw my picture on the front page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13165)|
| 3:39:29| which led me to believe they must have canceled the story that day and had to fill up the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13169)|
| 3:39:34| But anyway, the point was that they redid their project and presented it to the people in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13174)|
| 3:39:41| to the point of which, which was for 20 or 21 single mothers with children who have mental disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13181)|
| 3:39:48| the neighborhood accepted it to the point where one of the residents in the meeting said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13188)|
| 3:39:53| you know what, if these people or one of those people need help with their groceries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13193)|
| 3:39:58| I think I can go and help them do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13198)|
| 3:40:00| My whole point in this is that if we are going to solve the chronic homeless problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13200)|
| 3:40:06| the neighborhood must embrace these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13206)|
| 3:40:10| If they don't, it's going to be a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13210)|
| 3:40:13| And Mr. Lawler and company don't seem to get that message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13213)|
| 3:40:17| We were supposed to have a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13217)|
| 3:40:19| We're not having that on site selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13219)|
| 3:40:22| He was supposed to get us a visionary picture of where all the halfway houses and housing projects are in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13222)|
| 3:40:30| He's not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13230)|
| 3:40:34| According to legal opinions from both the city and county lawyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13234)|
| 3:40:38| we're treading with the anti-discrimination part of the Federal Home Housing Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13238)|
| 3:40:45| But my point is that if you come to the community and get the community to embrace the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13245)|
| 3:40:51| the project can succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13251)|
| 3:40:53| If you don't do that, it's not going to work and we'll never solve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13253)|
| 3:40:58| Thank you for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13258)|
| 3:40:59| I know it's late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13259)|
| 3:41:00| I appreciate you coming down here, and you do come down here quite often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13260)|
| 3:41:05| Just a little hint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13265)|
| 3:41:08| If you're here about a particular item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13268)|
| 3:41:12| let us know that you're here on that item so that we can have you speak when that item comes up instead of having to wait until the end of the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13272)|
| 3:41:19| No, I did do that, Commissioner, when I came in, but apparently it was passed in a whole group of them in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13279)|
| 3:41:27| It was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13287)|
| 3:41:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13288)|
| 3:41:29| If you can get to a commissioner and ask for it to be pulled off consent because you would like to say something about it, then that could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13289)|
| 3:41:36| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13296)|
| 3:41:37| Thank you, but it was very entertaining to see the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13297)|
| 3:41:41| Well, we're here for entertainment purposes only, at least some people think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13301)|
| 3:41:44| Hey, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13304)|
| 3:41:45| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13305)|
| 3:41:46| Joe, I believe there may be a little reverse discrimination here against the 1st, the 2nd, and the 9th District on all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13306)|
| 3:41:53| because it seems like that's where they put all these things at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13313)|
| 3:41:56| So, I mean, this discrimination thing can go both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13316)|
| 3:42:02| Thank you, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13322)|
| 3:42:04| Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13324)|
| 3:42:09| Hello, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13329)|
| 3:42:10| I'm Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13330)|
| 3:42:11| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road in Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13331)|
| 3:42:16| I just want to let you all know I've really put some pieces together and went through an epiphany the past month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13336)|
| 3:42:22| I've understood a lot of this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13342)|
| 3:42:25| I think I know exactly what's happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13345)|
| 3:42:28| And I wanted to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13348)|
| 3:42:32| Sometimes when a new employee starts a new job, they sometimes make a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13352)|
| 3:42:38| They don't understand how to fill out certain documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13358)|
| 3:42:42| or what material they're supposed to review to fill out certain documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13362)|
| 3:42:47| and they don't understand the complete history of a facility because they're a new employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13367)|
| 3:42:53| That being said, there were some documents filled out that are not accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13373)|
| 3:42:59| and I need to recover the originals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13379)|
| 3:43:04| Mr. Salter admitted to Larry VanGilder of the Hall Shopper approximately two months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13384)|
| 3:43:09| that John Evans did, in fact, do EPA reports or what's called biosolids reports for 03, 04, and 05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13389)|
| 3:43:18| Further, Mr. Salter told Mr. VanGilder what those reports said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13398)|
| 3:43:24| In addition to that, I can prove indisputably that those reports exist, and I need those reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13404)|
| 3:43:33| I'm not throwing accusations that anybody done anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13413)|
| 3:43:38| I'm simply stating that new employees sometimes make a mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13418)|
| 3:43:43| and I need the original reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13423)|
| 3:43:47| I can prove they exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13427)|
| 3:43:49| I know exactly what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13429)|
| 3:43:51| I've seen them before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13431)|
| 3:43:53| I talked about them with John Evans in the first part of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13433)|
| 3:43:57| Mr. Salter has admitted to Larry VanGilder approximately two months ago they exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13437)|
| 3:44:02| He told him what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13442)|
| 3:44:05| I'm not out to try and accuse anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13445)|
| 3:44:08| I'm just saying a mistake's been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13448)|
| 3:44:11| I need these documents desperately to collect your money and to show exactly what's happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13451)|
| 3:44:18| It's a lot more charitable situation than what we thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13458)|
| 3:44:23| I think I've got to the bottom of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13463)|
| 3:44:25| but I do need these documents to know an exact amount of everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13465)|
| 3:44:29| and exactly what's happened and the true story of what's happened here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13469)|
| 3:44:33| and not be having to go about something that might just be an honest mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13473)|
| 3:44:37| and having to be stuck with that in evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13477)|
| 3:44:43| That being said, I do have a ‑‑I'm not going to discuss all of the documents that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13483)|
| 3:44:50| but I am going to say that I do have a document from Natural Resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13490)|
| 3:44:58| that says before the spring of 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13498)|
| 3:45:02| we were only selling a small amount of animal compost from the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13502)|
| 3:45:08| The biosolids compost that had failed in 05 was allowed to cure until 06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13508)|
| 3:45:16| Folks, did they sell biosolids in 03, 04, and 05 or did they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13516)|
| 3:45:23| According to the records I've seen, they processed 30,000 tons of biosolids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13523)|
| 3:45:29| Did they sell it for the first three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13529)|
| 3:45:31| or were they not allowed to sell it for the first three years and why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13531)|
| 3:45:37| And I can't get a straight answer and I cannot get the original reports and I need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13537)|
| 3:45:43| They're public records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13543)|
| 3:45:45| They exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13545)|
| 3:45:46| I can prove they exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13546)|
| 3:45:48| There has been a mistake made and we need to get this straightened out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13548)|
| 3:45:52| so we can get all this over with and get it finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13552)|
| 3:45:55| And once I get those reports, I think I will have everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13555)|
| 3:45:59| and you all will be deprived of the luxury of speaking to me every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13559)|
| 3:46:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13564)|
| 3:46:09| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13569)|
| 3:46:10| Yeah, Tom, would you care to come to the podium just a minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13570)|
| 3:46:23| Did we sell anything in 03, 04, and 05?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13583)|
| 3:46:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13588)|
| 3:46:29| Do we have the reports on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13589)|
| 3:46:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13592)|
| 3:46:34| Would you be glad to turn them over to him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13594)|
| 3:46:37| He has access to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13597)|
| 3:46:39| He does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13599)|
| 3:46:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13600)|
| 3:46:41| We've turned over every document we have to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13601)|
| 3:46:43| He's been there multiple times and he has access to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13603)|
| 3:46:49| But we did sell things in those years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13609)|
| 3:46:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13611)|
| 3:46:52| But we didn't collect any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13612)|
| 3:46:53| Biosolids, did we collect any money for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13613)|
| 3:46:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13616)|
| 3:46:59| Beg your pardon, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13619)|
| 3:47:01| No, did you sell biosolids, Tom, 03, 04, and 05?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13621)|
| 3:47:07| I have to look at the documents and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13627)|
| 3:47:10| I mean, it started at a certain time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13630)|
| 3:47:13| And just standing here right now, I mean, if I had Mr. Rocket here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13633)|
| 3:47:17| he could tell you the exact date those began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13637)|
| 3:47:21| But I mean, if you say 03, 04, 05, I can't tell you exactly when it started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13641)|
| 3:47:26| Well, you could get that for the commission next week, couldn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13646)|
| 3:47:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13651)|
| 3:47:32| I would appreciate it if you would get the papers to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13652)|
| 3:47:36| whether we sold biosolids in 03, 04, and 05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13656)|
| 3:47:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13659)|
| 3:47:40| And get it to us by next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13660)|
| 3:47:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13661)|
| 3:47:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13663)|
| 3:47:47| And last on our list is a Frank Fusco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13667)|
| 3:47:56| Sir, if you'll identify yourself by name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13676)|
| 3:47:58| Frank Fusco, 2022 Lovell Road, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13678)|
| 3:48:03| I bought that property a couple years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13683)|
| 3:48:06| When I bought it, it was in bad shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13686)|
| 3:48:07| It had an old garage on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13687)|
| 3:48:10| It was all grown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13690)|
| 3:48:12| It had a house right on the corner of Hickey and Lovell Road blocking the view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13692)|
| 3:48:17| when traffic would pull up in Hickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13697)|
| 3:48:19| Neighbors couldn't wait for it to get torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13699)|
| 3:48:21| I actually tore it down and started cleaning up the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13701)|
| 3:48:25| Cleaned it up, made it real nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13705)|
| 3:48:26| Let me give you some background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13706)|
| 3:48:27| I'm right on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13707)|
| 3:48:28| Most of you all don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13708)|
| 3:48:29| I'm right on the corner of Hickey and Lovell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13709)|
| 3:48:31| I'm the neighbor of John Deere Landscape, a 20-acre site that sells retail products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13711)|
| 3:48:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13718)|
| 3:48:39| I'm on that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13719)|
| 3:48:40| I lived there for nine months, fixed the place up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13720)|
| 3:48:43| During that time, I actually complained a couple times to code enforcement about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13723)|
| 3:48:47| John Deere Landscape and some of the things they were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13727)|
| 3:48:50| It pretty much fell on deaf ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13730)|
| 3:48:54| I'm like, okay, I get the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13734)|
| 3:48:57| If it works for them, maybe it can work for me on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13737)|
| 3:48:59| I mean, if they're going to overlook what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13739)|
| 3:49:01| maybe my corner is not a bad corner to retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13741)|
| 3:49:04| I found out the nine months that I was there that it wasn't really that great of a deal for residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13744)|
| 3:49:09| because I could smell the mulch being loaded up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13749)|
| 3:49:12| It's 135 feet away from my door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13752)|
| 3:49:16| The dust would come over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13756)|
| 3:49:17| I'd hear the traffic of the skid steers working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13757)|
| 3:49:21| I'd hear the dumpsters dumping at 7 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13761)|
| 3:49:25| So I began to think that maybe this is not that great of a property real estate-wide for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13765)|
| 3:49:30| But then again, you know, if I can retail out of there like John Deere is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13770)|
| 3:49:34| hey, it might work for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13774)|
| 3:49:35| It might work for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13775)|
| 3:49:37| So I started retailing out of there a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13777)|
| 3:49:39| started selling some washer and dryers off the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13779)|
| 3:49:42| buying some trucks, selling off the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13782)|
| 3:49:44| It actually worked pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13784)|
| 3:49:45| I mean, it was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13785)|
| 3:49:46| I mean, you all know the traffic flow on Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13786)|
| 3:49:49| It's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13789)|
| 3:49:50| It's better than on Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13790)|
| 3:49:51| So I'm thinking it works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13791)|
| 3:49:54| So, you know, I'm thinking, well, that's maybe a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13794)|
| 3:49:56| You know, if I can't use it residentially, I'm not getting my money for a rent, you know, or resale value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13796)|
| 3:50:01| then I'll just make it work in retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13801)|
| 3:50:03| Well, you know, then I get my chops busted by code enforcement saying, well, you can't do that there, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13803)|
| 3:50:09| It's not the right zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13809)|
| 3:50:11| I'm like, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13811)|
| 3:50:12| Well, they're doing it over there and it's not the right zoning, so what do I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13812)|
| 3:50:15| Well, you've got to go for, you know, a zone change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13815)|
| 3:50:18| I'm like, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13818)|
| 3:50:19| So I pay my $1,100, go for a zone change, go for CA, you know, the Lowe's outside display that John Deere's got 20 acres of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13819)|
| 3:50:31| They turn me down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13831)|
| 3:50:32| They shoot me down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13832)|
| 3:50:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13835)|
| 3:50:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13836)|
| 3:50:37| They can do it, but I can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13837)|
| 3:50:38| You know, where's the fairness of what you guys are doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13838)|
| 3:50:42| I mean, you guys created the zone ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13842)|
| 3:50:44| You know, so my out was to go get rezoned to do what they're doing illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13844)|
| 3:50:49| They're zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13849)|
| 3:50:51| Agricultural says that you cannot sell retail of anything other than what you grow on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13851)|
| 3:50:59| You guys know the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13859)|
| 3:51:00| I mean, I'm like an expert on zoning now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13860)|
| 3:51:02| So, I mean, pretty much everything they're doing over there is illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13862)|
| 3:51:07| So I complain again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13867)|
| 3:51:10| The grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13870)|
| 3:51:12| I make a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13872)|
| 3:51:13| Call me back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13873)|
| 3:51:14| I have a complaint about John Deere landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13874)|
| 3:51:17| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13877)|
| 3:51:18| I never get a call back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13878)|
| 3:51:20| I send an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13880)|
| 3:51:23| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13883)|
| 3:51:24| No, no response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13884)|
| 3:51:26| But they bust my chops for doing what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13886)|
| 3:51:30| Now, here's the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13890)|
| 3:51:32| I don't mind going back to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13892)|
| 3:51:36| You want me to go back to residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13896)|
| 3:51:38| So my value can go back up, get John Deere zoned properly or shut them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13898)|
| 3:51:45| Apply the ordinances fairly, not selectively or unfairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13905)|
| 3:51:51| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13911)|
| 3:51:52| So the reason why I'm coming to you is because I'm not on the agenda this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13912)|
| 3:51:55| but I'm coming up next month for appeal to get you guys to send it back to Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13915)|
| 3:52:02| get me a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13922)|
| 3:52:04| You know, let's get going with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13924)|
| 3:52:06| Get me zoned so I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13926)|
| 3:52:08| Sir, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13928)|
| 3:52:09| Or shut us both down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13929)|
| 3:52:13| Get us both rezoned or shut us both down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13933)|
| 3:52:16| I mean, that's fair, and that's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13936)|
| 3:52:18| You know, if you guys want us to go by the law, here's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13938)|
| 3:52:21| Here's how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13941)|
| 3:52:22| You don't have selective zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13942)|
| 3:52:25| You don't have unfair zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13945)|
| 3:52:28| And that's where I'll just leave it at that until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13948)|
| 3:52:31| And I appreciate your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13951)|
| 3:52:34| Mr. Lambert, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13954)|
| 3:52:36| Sir, sir, I just wanted to tell you that is in mine and Brad's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13956)|
| 3:52:41| Why don't you give each of us a call and we'll see what we can, each of us separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13961)|
| 3:52:47| We don't want to break the sunshine law, but we'll see what we can do for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=13967)|
