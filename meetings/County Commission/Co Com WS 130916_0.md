| 0:00:00| One forty-six, I need to call the public hearing to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=0)|
| 0:00:08| If commissioners would take your seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=8)|
| 0:00:11| We need to have discussion on Ordinance 013-8-103,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=11)|
| 0:00:15| proposed amendments to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance to remove distance regulations for the sale of beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=15)|
| 0:00:20| for the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=20)|
| 0:00:22| We don't have to take any actions in those non-action items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=22)|
| 0:00:26| Is there anybody in the public, in the audience that wants to respond or have any comment in regards to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=26)|
| 0:00:32| distance regulations for the sale of beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=32)|
| 0:00:37| Any of the commissioners have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=37)|
| 0:00:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=44)|
| 0:00:45| Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=45)|
| 0:00:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=46)|
| 0:00:47| Do you want to go over why we're looking at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=47)|
| 0:00:49| You would ask me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=49)|
| 0:00:51| We are changing the moving the ordinances from zoning and putting them over just in regular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=51)|
| 0:00:59| And, therefore, this sets the state guidelines for the boundaries from residential agriculture for the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=59)|
| 0:01:09| And so it takes it out of zoning and places it in general ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=69)|
| 0:01:12| That's because they have to coincide with the state liquor laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=72)|
| 0:01:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=77)|
| 0:01:20| And today will be the next Monday will be the second reading of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=80)|
| 0:01:25| So if there's no discussion, we'll close this part of the meeting and re-adjourn at 2 o'clock for commission work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=85)|
| 0:01:37| At 2 o'clock and we'll call to order the commission workshop for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=97)|

| 0:04:15| 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| Does anybody wish to pull any of those from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=261)|

| 0:04:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| Sam's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| Any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| Also, Mr. Chairman, we have items before some withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| and some deferred related to workman's compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=292)|
| 0:05:00| Are we going to get something happening that maybe we need to hear at a luncheon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| or do we need to hear something today about what may be taking place that may be putting these on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| or off or back and forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| And I'm just asking for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| If it's not something that is ready to be discussed yet, I'm okay with that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| Mark, do you care to address the reason for deferral or where we're at on the workman's comp issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=321)|
| 0:05:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| What we're doing is we are bringing worker's comp back into in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=329)|
| 0:05:36| So that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| And then the items on the agenda are items where we've had to go out for RFPs, for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=338)|
| 0:05:48| different types of third-party associations that we have to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| And as far as I'm concerned, Mr. Chairman, that answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| There won't be any changes for employees in this arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| So maybe better service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| I just wanted to ask a question about 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| So can we just take it off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| Can we pull it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| Just take it off and then I'll have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| We'll ask a question next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| Any other requests for consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| I hear a motion to set the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=391)|
| 0:06:45| The next item is on Page 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| It's Item Number 5, Resolution 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| It's appointing a commissioner to serve as a non-voting liaison to the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=410)|
| 0:07:00| Mr. Walter, is this under the new formation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| It's a non-voting commissioner just to sit in at the meetings for advice and such?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| Anybody have an interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| I know Commissioner Brown had an interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| And Commissioner Broyles had an interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=435)|
| 0:07:27| This is non-voting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| It's just there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| It's a non-voting advice member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| Yeah, just to kind of give historical advice based on what commission does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| Let me just make like a statement on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| I didn't resign because I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| But it's okay if somebody else wants to be on it because I've been on it a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| The reason I resigned was so we could get a citizen on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| I just wanted to make it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| And, I mean, if you all wanted me to be the non-voting member, I think that would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| But I think, you know, to have somebody else on there would be too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| We haven't done anything in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| There hasn't been a vote in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| But I think it's fine to have maybe some new blood there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| But that was my reason for resigning was just so we could get a citizen on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Because it reformed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| Like I said, I'd be willing to serve as the ex-officio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| But, you know, I think new blood's fine because there's not, you know, there just hasn't been any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=491)|
| 0:08:19| If Mike wants to do it, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| But I'm going to be at all the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| I mean, I've been really unhappy with the Ethics Committee and how things have been handled in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| You're good with Commissioner Brown and then you just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| Yeah, but I'm going to be there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| And by affirmation, we make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| I need a motion for affirmation for Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=522)|

| 0:08:58| It's approving a line item transfer of $3,785,000 previously approved designated monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| from the Pond Gap Elementary School renovation project to the Career and Technical Education Magnet High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| renovation project, which line item transfer will cause no delay to the renovations at Pond Gap Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=551)|
| 0:09:18| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| I did not pull this item from the agenda or it needs to be discussed, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=566)|
| 0:09:33| And I think that may be why it was pulled for strictly for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| I'd like to say this morning that Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Schaust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| and I attended the groundbreaking of a new addition at Shannondale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=584)|
| 0:09:52| I think Larry and I have to move 500 wheelbarrows of dirt in order to get the back of the property up to the right level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=592)|
| 0:10:01| And cut a tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| But we're going to get a state legislator to help us cut the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| It's a great thing, this renovation of Shannondale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| in that it's one of those things that's come along that none of us can say it was before our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=611)|
| 0:10:19| Shannondale was a little bit of renovation, windows and energy and things like that, a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=619)|
| 0:10:28| But what's happening now is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| Twelve classrooms, a new media center and all that sort of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| It represents sort of a growing nimbleness of the Board of Education to get on with a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=636)|
| 0:10:44| which then leads to this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| We'll notice that it's pond gaps money because a career technical college at Straw Plains was not in last year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=647)|
| 0:10:58| of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| This year's budget is not three months old, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| and we have millions of dollars being spent career technical education at Straw Plains Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=664)|
| 0:11:12| a great co-location of a high school in Tullis City State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=672)|
| 0:11:20| Now, let me go back to the word that I used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| It was nimbleness that got, I think, the Board of Education to be where they are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=682)|
| 0:11:28| They've seized the moment, so to speak, and they've got on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| One of the things that we have before us, though, is we will have to find, we, Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=694)|
| 0:11:41| we will have to work sure that we make sure that the people at Pond Gap are reassured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=701)|
| 0:11:47| that their project's not going to fall behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and, again, move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| I'd like someone from the Board of Education or the schools to come up and just kind of answer, generally speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=719)|
| 0:12:08| how is this not going to delay the renovations, the original scheduled renovations at Pond Gap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=728)|
| 0:12:15| I just, you know, Pond Gap's one of those unique schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| and I know you have done a lot of programming at a community school, but it has such a diverse population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=737)|
| 0:12:24| you know, ethnic, different varieties of folks that get centered around the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| So I really, you know, my heart goes out to that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| so I just want to understand what their timeline was and what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| and then I'll have a different line of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Jim McIntyre, 912 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| Superintendent of Schools, and thank you, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| The basic idea here is that we are seeking to open the new Career Magnet Academy at Strawberry Plains in the fall of 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=771)|
| 0:13:03| We've worked very closely with leaders of industry and with Pellissippi State Community College to develop that program of study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| and we think we are very excited about this partnership, and we think it's going to be a great opportunity for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| As Commissioner Wright pointed out, it's not in the current year's capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| and so it would, in order to open in the fall of 2014, we do have to make some adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| The basic idea is to utilize $3.8 million that was part of the fund balance that was designated for Pond Gap Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=806)|
| 0:13:35| to fund the renovations at Strawberry Plains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| and then to essentially replace those dollars with funds from the fiscal year 15 capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=819)|
| 0:13:49| The reason that it won't cause a delay is because we are moving through the design process for Pond Gap Elementary School project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=829)|
| 0:13:57| and so we are looking at design development beginning September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| We have to have construction documents that will be created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| That's probably in the November time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| We are looking at the board to approve, excuse me, our folks, our facilities department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=848)|
| 0:14:17| to approve those construction documents probably sometime in the February-March time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| and then you have to bid out, obviously, for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| That takes six to eight weeks, and so we anticipate approval of the construction contract sometime in roughly May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=865)|
| 0:14:34| and then beginning of construction in June of 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| So this proposal leaves significant dollars in the fund balance designation that was proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=878)|
| 0:14:46| and then the new fiscal year begins July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| So we anticipate that this would go smoothly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| We anticipate that the time frame that was proposed for Pond Gap Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| and I agree with you, it's a great renovation project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| It's a significant addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| It's really allowing us to be able to design a facility, a physical space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| that will support the programmatic initiative of the community school at Pond Gap Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| We think it's going to be a great project, and we believe that within this proposal we can continue to move apace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| and make sure that we are on schedule to make sure that that happens as originally projected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Thank you for that, and my second kind of switch here is, you know, I've,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| and maybe it's just me, but it seems like the whole definition of magnet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| and what a magnet school is and what the point and purpose of magnet schools has been shifted over the last kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=935)|
| 0:15:44| of maybe couple of years, couple of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| Could you kind of discuss how, you know, again, from my limited view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| it just seems like, you know, a magnet school in a far kind of rural part of a county isn't what the whole concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=951)|
| 0:16:01| of magnet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| And I'm sure, like I say, there's been an evolution since magnet schools first started probably in the 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| you know, as far as the whole desegregation thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| But I'm just trying to get to understand how we are defining a magnet school as opposed to what it used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=969)|
| 0:16:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| I mean, broadly speaking, a magnet school is any program, a unique program of study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=977)|
| 0:16:25| that would draw students from a broader range than just a narrow geographical area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| That's traditionally the boundaries of a school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| So the LNN STEM Academy, for example, is a magnet school in that it draws students from all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=994)|
| 0:16:41| Vine Middle School is a magnet school in that it draws students both from a geographic zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| and from outside of that geographic zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| And so I think that there can be a variety of goals and purposes of a magnet school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1009)|
| 0:16:56| For me, it's really about access to opportunity, to unique educational programming for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1016)|
| 0:17:03| And I think if you look at the proposal for the Career and Technical Education or, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| I'm calling it the Career Magnet Academy at Pellissippi State, if you look at the proposal for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| some really unique programming in terms of high-wage, high-demand, high-skilled jobs of the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1033)|
| 0:17:20| that we've worked really closely with industry to develop so that students have a pathway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| to a really promising career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| And it's students from across the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| and that may be very attractive to some students and other students it won't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| But we have this notion in the Knox County Schools and this philosophy that's in our strategic plan where we talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| about multiple pathways to success that we believe very strongly that every student can be successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| but it may require different ways to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| It may require different options and different educational opportunities in order for every student to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1065)|
| 0:17:51| And so we want to make sure that we have a pathway for every student to find success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| In the past, you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| There has been magnet schools that have been used for a variety of purposes, including school improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| including demographic diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| So there's been a variety of purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| But I think at its heart, a magnet concept is about access to unique educational programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| for students from across our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1096)|
| 0:18:25| Commissioner Olden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| Dr. McIntyre, your answer, you answer my question as far as my concern is it's not going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1110)|
| 0:18:40| a delay from what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| My concern is that it might get forgot about as things have been in the past when money's been moved around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1123)|
| 0:18:50| and projects haven't got done and they've come back and we've had to reallocate money again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| That's what I don't want to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| Pond Gap has done a lot of great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| And it is a very diverse elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| And it's in badly need of this renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| And you've assured me that it's going to be done and it's going to be done on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| And that was my main concern with the moving of this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| I just don't want it to be lost in the budget shuffle come June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| No, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| And I can assure you it will be part of my budget recommendation for fiscal year 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| the fiscal year 15 capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| Of course, I don't have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| But the school board has expressed the same interest and concern that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1170)|
| 0:19:37| We want to make sure that this continues forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| We want to make sure that the Pond Gap Elementary School project happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| This proposal allows us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| And I have every confidence that it will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| No other discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1195)|

| 0:20:03| It's Resolution 407.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| It's approving an agreement in the amount of $110,750 with CDM Smith, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| for assistance in preparing an up to the Knox County Strategic Transportation Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| and Needs Assessment funded in the current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| Can I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| Dwight, if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| The reason I left it off is so you can give you an opportunity to explain to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| in public what your goal is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| This is going to be of a lot of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| It will be about an eight-month undertaking once it's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| So I don't want you to think it's going to happen quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| But this is essentially a major update to our strategic road plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| which is the assessment that will be done by CDM Smith in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| It looks at traffic volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| It looks at road width and condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| And looks now, for the first time, at crash data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| which we haven't had available in years past when we've done this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| And gives us a blueprint for 20 years for where road improvements are going to be needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| and where potentially even extensions of existing roads or new roads might be needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1269)|
| 0:21:17| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1277)|

| 0:22:28| What I hoped to achieve was exactly what took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| I want the TVA Credit Union to be recognized for taking part in participating in activities at the recreational area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1351)|
| 0:22:40| there at New Farmers Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1360)|

| 0:22:54| Page 11, Item Number 35, Resolution 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| It's approving a contract with Total Administrative Services Corporation, TAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| for Flexible Benefit Account and Health Reimbursement Administration Services for Knox County Government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| first year funded in the current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Let me ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| I guess, are you the one to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| Has anything changed here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| I looked at my flex card when I saw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| It's the same TAC task, T-A-S-C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| And what does it mean, first year funded in the current budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| When was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| How was it funded otherwise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| It's the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| It is the same company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| They won the bid for a new contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| How was it funded if it's not in the current budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| Last year's or next year's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| I mean, that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| Maybe that's a stupid question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| I think we fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| I think what that's saying is that we fund it every year in the current budget going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| Is that correct, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| Yeah, it's just funded one year at a time, Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| It's the same as we've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| I think the part that you're talking about, this what Commissioner Smith asked to be put on each resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1449)|
| 0:24:17| whether it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| So it's in the budget in our internal service funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| That's not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| And we would, the county would save money because this is not subject to Social Security, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| So it saves a little there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| And who gets the forfeitures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| Do they get them or do we get them back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| We get them back in, like, in March of the next year or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| Do you have that six-month rollout or six-week rollout or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| Is that much money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| About $20,000 to $30,000 last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Twenty-some thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| Item 36, Resolution 902, expressing the commission's support of the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1502)|
| 0:25:10| and requesting the Knox County clerk to send a true and correct copy of this resolution to Congressman John Duncan, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1510)|
| 0:25:19| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| I had asked that this be deferred so that we could take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| And so, Chris Caldwell, if you could come to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| We get a lot from people who want us to kind of vote on these types of things that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| really doesn't have an immediate impact, but to kind of express the will of the commission to the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| and to the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| It's my understanding that this has already passed the Senate, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| And it's waiting in the House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| So Congressman Duncan has not yet taken a formal position on this, but is asking for people to give him input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| With regards to this, do we know how much money or what a formula would be in terms of how much money we would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1552)|
| 0:26:00| getting back in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| I do not know a number for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| What we do know, and I can go over some of the facts that we have gathered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| and I sent you all some articles, pros and cons of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| So I'm taking a stance for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| I'm taking a stance against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| And let me just go over some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| Myself and Jason Lee and my department, we sit down and went over some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| And here are some facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| And you said a couple of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| We know that the online retail revenue in 2012 was $226 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1588)|
| 0:26:38| One thing that I think is getting overlooked is online state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| and local taxes are still owed by consumers but are rarely paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| So I would ask you to show your hands who bought things online over the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| And then if you did, did you report them on your income tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| Didn't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| But, you know, your stuff's too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| So states have, I guess, kind of, if this marketplace fair and effective was to pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1618)|
| 0:27:08| states have two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| Join the streamlined sales and use tax agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| And it should be known that Tennessee is an associate member state currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| So that's one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| Our option two is to adopt the simplification mandate that's included in the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| As a department, we went through and looked at pros and cons of the Marketplace Fairness Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| And let me give you some pros.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| Pros is, of course, it's been official to state and local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| States are going to use that to help cover deficits if it were to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| I think that's why you see most states are supportive of the Marketplace Fairness Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1665)|
| 0:27:53| It is estimated that anywhere between $11 and $23 billion in lost revenue to states in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1673)|
| 0:28:02| The other pro that we'll talk about is it levels the playing field for brick and mortar businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1682)|
| 0:28:10| So, in theory, it helps local businesses by giving them a level playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1690)|
| 0:28:18| Some cons of the Marketplace Fairness Act, it would, there are more than 9,000 state and local tax rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1698)|
| 0:28:27| And so you're forcing a business to keep up with 9,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1707)|
| 0:28:34| The number that I saw was 9,600 state and local tax rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| It is known that the states must purchase the software for the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| But companies would have to hire additional help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| So you, it's potentially devastating for a small online company that has, let's say, about a million dollars in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1729)|
| 0:28:58| Because the increased admin costs could really be devastating for them as to where if you're Best Buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1738)|
| 0:29:06| or Amazon, it's not going to have that big of an impact on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| It does run the risk of slowing the economic recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| You think you're putting, that's $11 to $23 billion in revenue and sales in 2012 that haven't been taxed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1755)|
| 0:29:25| And so you take the amount that's taxed, which is the $11 to $23 billion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| and you're pulling that out of the economy and you're paying it to local and state governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| That's just money that's coming out of the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| And it could subject small businesses to possible audits by the out-of-state collectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1779)|
| 0:29:47| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| I mean, we know that here, you've heard me talk about how we get our SIDUS taxes reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1788)|
| 0:29:59| and sometimes it should went to us instead of the town of Fairgate or us instead of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| You're going to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| And so that's just pros and cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| I'm sure there's a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| That's just keeping it kind of simple and high level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| I don't have a position, nor will I take one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| Isn't there an exemption, though, for people who generate under a million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| Under a million dollars, there is an exemption, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| The concern that I've read is that if you're in that category of a million to 1.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| and you have to do all these fees, then it could be really devastating to a company like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| You know, you've got to draw the line somewhere if you're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| So you're always going to have that threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| You know, it's really a, I don't know, it's an interesting topic to research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1851)|
| 0:31:01| I could take either side of this and make an argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| I mean, I really could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| Listen, online, if you purchase things online, you're supposed to pay them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1869)|
| 0:31:17| And so I keep on thinking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| So you're supposed to pay them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| But as we know, most don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| It's a double-edged sword.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| I could see both sides of the argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| But I was asked to research, and that's what we did in the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| We sat down and went over the pros and the cons, and that's what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1891)|
| 0:31:38| I mean, it's ultimately the decision of Congress of what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1898)|
| 0:31:45| If they say this is going to happen, then this is what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| Would Knox County benefit from increased tax revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| I mean, one article that I read said that this is an issue that has Republicans disagreeing with Republicans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1915)|
| 0:32:06| and Democrats disagreeing with Democrats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| But it's uniting states because the states see this as a way to get in revenue and not raise taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| And so that's where I guess that's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| So, but if you read anything that I sent out over the past month, you could take a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1939)|
| 0:32:27| I just wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| I told you I would go over some pros and cons and not really state a position because I don't think it's not my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1948)|
| 0:32:36| I don't think it's my job to have a position on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| But if, because it is owed, if someone were to come in and conduct some kind of audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| and found that you had ordered online, theoretically, they could come in and force you to pay tax right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| Actually, me and Jason Lay, I think he's back there, we actually had this discussion this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| You're supposed to report that on your income taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| So if they wanted to be sticklers about it, they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| You know, if you, if they were to pull your income tax return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| and audit it and wanted to see what you had purchased online to see that you didn't report sales tax on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| then, I mean, they could hit you for that because you're, it's, it's still owed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| but it's just barely reported because they don't monitor it and they don't enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| I know Commissioner Briggs had brought up at our last meeting something about being revenue neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| I'll yield the floor to you if you'd like to expound on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| You know, I think what Chris said is absolutely true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| This is controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Even some of the most conservative Republicans in the state, such as Lieutenant Governor Ramsey, is for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| And there's other people that are conservative that are against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| But the thing that I think we don't want to do, there's some things that we do want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| is that one part of this is protecting our local and our state businesses against outside competitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| because it puts them at a competitive disadvantage for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| One, they're having to pay the bricks and mortars and the property taxes to have a business in this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2046)|
| 0:34:15| And then, secondly, is that because our state income tax is nearly 10 percent, these online retailers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2055)|
| 0:34:22| everything else being equal, you're getting a 10 percent discount if you don't pay the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| And I think, but on the other hand, a lot of us feel that the citizens are paying enough taxes already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2068)|
| 0:34:35| and, you know, we don't need to be burdening them with another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| What we're really trying to do is to make a level playing ground, you know, for our local businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| I mean, you know, this is a vote to protect local businesses is what it's all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| And I think that we should put an amendment on that or add something to it is to make it revenue neutral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| so the citizens don't get punished on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| But yet, and I am going to vote for it, I'll say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| But I'm doing it to just to give a level playing field for our brick and mortar Tennessee businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2102)|
| 0:35:10| But I would like to add and I'll make a motion that we add an amendment, if that's not on there already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| to ask that they make it revenue neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| Who made the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| I think I did originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| She's got Brown and Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| Do you all agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| Do we need to do a substitute motion or are you all going to agree with the amendment either way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| I do not agree with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| I'll do another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| You can't substitute substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| So is that a form of substitute motion, Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| Yeah, let's make it a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| That way we can then vote on it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| I need you to second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| I'll stand by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Is it on the substitute motion or do we still want to just continue the discussion overall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| I'll go up for the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| And my statement is on substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| My statement is on the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Is yours on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| You know, that's when I kind of cropped up last time that this came before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2174)|
| 0:36:21| Hearing what Chris kind of laid out, I guess it all depends on how you define revenue neutral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2181)|
| 0:36:29| people already being burdened enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| We, I'll say we, we aren't paying this tax that we owe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| So if it's revenue neutral, what's the point of the bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| The whole point of the bill is we have to protect our brick and mortar businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| which are the backbone of this community that we citizens aren't putting them on a fair playing field with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2206)|
| 0:37:00| We are a sales tax based state, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| We have a high sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| We do that to run the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| So if we make this, in my definition of revenue neutral means no additional dollars can be brought in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2229)|
| 0:37:16| that's not the whole point of this bill is to say, no, Amazon, eBay, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2236)|
| 0:37:24| you all need to pay the state part, the state tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| Citizens, you need to pay the state sales tax part of this for the transaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| because our citizens probably aren't in their year-end filings saying I spent, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| $5,000 on online sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| So I cannot support this substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| I do support the original letter that's to be sent to Congressman Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| But this making it revenue neutral, it sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| It plays well in the newspaper and on print, I mean on the television, but that's not the point of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2282)|
| 0:38:09| The point of this is we need to write this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| This is a tax question, so we're talking about money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| So it can't be revenue neutral and have any teeth associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2295)|
| 0:38:22| So I don't want to send a mixed message to our congressman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| I want him to understand that we support the folks who are outside of this state trying to make money on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2305)|
| 0:38:32| or inside of this state for that matter with agreement trying to make money by undercutting the cost by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2312)|
| 0:38:41| you know, up to ten percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| And that's significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| So I cannot support this substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| Is it on the or is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| Commissioner Rotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| I thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| On the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| Your statement is not on the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| On the substitute motion, I'm in agreement with Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| The question is not about anything other than should sales tax be collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2344)|
| 0:39:11| My staff at various years during her career has had sales tax license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2351)|
| 0:39:19| She had to determine if the end user, if the person purchasing was an end user.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2359)|
| 0:39:26| And if they, if that purchasing entity was an end user, sales tax had to be collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2366)|
| 0:39:34| That's the only thing that's before us in the original resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| Is it on the substitute, Doc?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| If somebody else has a comment, I'll let them make the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| Well, we're voting on the substitute, so I don't think we can talk about the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| Yeah, but his is on the original motion, correct, still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| Well, you see, when I say make it revenue neutral, and I don't know how much this is going to grow into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| but I think you can't just look at what we're doing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| But it's what it's going to be doing in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| And the problem is, is that a sales tax falls as a disproportionate burden on lower income people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2407)|
| 0:40:14| Now, today, it may make up, and I have no idea what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| It may make up 5 percent or 10 percent of all sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| It may make up 50 percent of the sales 15 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| And what I would, if you really know what I would like to see from it, if it ever gets to that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| and the amount of revenue coming in stays what it is today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| I'd like to see them cut the sales tax if they were able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| Because that's where the problem is, is that it's any sort of sales tax is a regressive tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| And today, does it make a whole lot of difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| But I don't know what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| If you look at the growth of these things, if you look at a graph to the growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| I think it's going to be more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| And, you know, what it is in the future, I don't know what it will be, but it could be we're ordering everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| You may get online and order your groceries from, you know, from Kroger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| and then go by there and pick them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| It may be the same with a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| You get online and get a little card and then swipe it when you go to the gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| I mean, I don't know where things are going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| but I would rather than see this, you know, this additional tax burden on people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| I'd like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| If anything, if that starts to happen and we are getting more revenues from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| I'd like to be able to see us cut the sales tax more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| And that's why I mean making it revenue neutral, not talking about something we're doing today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| but what we may have 10 or 15 or 20 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| Commissioner Burrell, is it on the substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| I have to disagree with Commissioner Briggs, I think, and I agree with Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| We're talking about whether or not sales tax needs to be paid right now today on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2505)|
| 0:41:52| And, you know, lower income people generally don't buy things online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| They can't afford to have a computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| A lot of them don't have credit cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| So I don't see how that's going to make that huge difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| We are a state, for better or worse, that depends on sales tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| Yes, sales tax is incredibly regressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| I'd love to see us do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| But right now that's how we're funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| And nobody is asking for an additional tax burden to be placed on anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| This is a tax people are supposed to be paying already, and they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| They've used a loophole to avoid paying the taxes that they are supposed to be taxing or paying already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2552)|
| 0:42:39| And it's time to stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| Any more discussion on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| So the vote, the roll call vote coming up will be on the substitute motion that adds an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| to making it revenue neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| Commissioner McKenzie votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2580)|

| 0:43:02| Commissioner Broyles votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| Commissioner Norman votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| Commissioner Ombi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| Commissioner Ombi votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| Commissioner Briggs votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| Commissioner Anders votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2597)|

| 0:43:19| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2599)|

| 0:43:21| Commissioner Wright votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2602)|

| 0:43:25| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2605)|

| 0:43:28| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Commissioner Shouse votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| Substitute motion fell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| We're back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| You know, sometimes we strain in a net to swallow a camel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| We're trying to make this thing too big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| There's really a simple solution to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| I know Congress never does anything simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| But, Chris, you said that they were looking at $226 billion with $11 to $12 billion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| in sales taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| Come back to all the states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| That's annually, right, for all the states?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| Well, you've got 9,600 different tax rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2648)|
| 0:44:16| Back to this previous motion we just defeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| There's no way to figure this thing to have a revenue neutral income on it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| And to answer Ms. Brewer's question, those who don't have the computers or credit cards are already paying their part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| They're paying the tax when they buy the stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| The simplest thing to do, and I think I'd like to put this in the form of a motion that we recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| that they pick a level whether it's 7 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| Seven percent collected beats zero not collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| So pick a flat rate for all the states and then let that come back and be divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2686)|
| 0:44:53| I'd like to put that in the form of a motion that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| That would be a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| I'm going to go ahead and second it because I'm intrigued by the idea of recommending to them that they look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2699)|
| 0:45:08| Because you look at a small business person and somebody who's in that 1 million to 1.2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| if they're going to have to look at 9,600, if they're nationwide, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| that's not going to be an easy thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| I mean, yeah, and you come in with one rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| I mean, at least ask them to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| That's all your motion is doing is saying, hey, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| but just consider making it somewhat easier on these people instead of having to calculate 9,600 different tax rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| So I'm going to second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| We need to reinvent the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| This second vote on the substitute motion will be to add the amendment of adding a flat rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| national flat rate Internet sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| And we have this motion second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| We'll take the roll call vote again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| First district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2758)|

| 0:46:34| Commissioner Shouse votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| The motion, the substitute motion passes, so the letter will be amended to add the suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| of consideration of a flat tax or a flat fee tax on Internet sales nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| You know, if whatever they collect, it beats nothing they're collecting now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| and it makes it a level playing field for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| I'm going to change my vote now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| I think that a letter like that should be unanimous, so I'm going to change my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| Actually, we've already announced the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| I don't think we can change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| Oh, you can't change it at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| Once it's announced, you can't change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| Too bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| Actually, I support a flat tax, just not and I think it has to be for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| It still sets it up uneven between Internet and brick and mortar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| But, actually, believe it or not, guys, I actually support a flat tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| Next item, Claire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| The next item is on Page 12, Item Number 37, Resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| It's approving a transfer by donation and fee of the ownership of 390.88 acres of real property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2857)|
| 0:47:44| and the improvements thereon owned by Knox County, Tennessee and located in the Seven Islands Wildlife Refuge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2864)|
| 0:47:50| in the 8th and 9th Commission Districts of Knox County, Tennessee, to the State of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| for the use of said property by the State of Tennessee as part of the State Seven Islands Wildlife Refuge Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| Requires no expenditure of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| Commissioner Brown, is that your light on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| Are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| Since I moved, my staff has changed my light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| Do we have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| Yeah, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| I'd just like someone to, I don't know if Doug or someone can talk about, is this the entire facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| Are we keeping some parts of the Seven Islands Park in the county's kind of basket?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2906)|
| 0:48:40| Tim Burchett, 501 Princeton Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| No, it's all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| This is going to be a good deal for the county and for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| They're going to be able to do some things for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| and I think make it more accessible to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| It's, I believe, deeded already to be a park, so that's going to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| And now with the state's resources, they can come in and do some things that we would love to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| but it's not really within our scope of responsibility or abilities to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| And do we have, I guess, gentlemen's handshake agreement that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| if the budget takes a loop that this won't be the first thing that they chop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| are they going to kind of commit to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| Because I know with House Mountain, you know, they were going to kind of, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| I don't know the history wasn't here, but that was a deal we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| It's a sore spot with people and it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| You're correct, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| The House Mountain was actually negotiated, oddly enough, between Ned McWhorter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| and Ben Atchley in the tunnel going over to the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| It was at the end and he caught the governor in the hallway and got him at a weak moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| And they handshook agreement and got that as a state park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| And then we all know the back and forth on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| But, no, this is going to be something that's been agreed upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| and I would hope that they would follow through with their promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| If you're aware of anything going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| East Tennessee has been woefully underfunded by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| If you look at what's going on in Middle and West Tennessee with the investment by the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| East Tennessee has been way underfunded compared to the rest of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| So this will allow them to play a little bit of catch-up with us, a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3017)|
| 0:50:24| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| Mr. Chairman, there was a lady called me this morning and said she'd like to speak on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| She was the owner of the property before the Claussen's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| I don't know if she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| She may be here at our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| But she's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| I don't see her coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| The owner of the property prior to Claussen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| Prior to Claussen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| The details of this are going to be announced on Friday at the Legacy Parks luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| And I don't think any of us, maybe the mayor does, I'm not sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| but any of us don't know all of the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| But I know there's some good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| I believe also they're going to take the state is going to buy an addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| of 30 acres there for another part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| I know it's supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| There's a cat in the bag there, Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| Don't let it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| It's already out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| Anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| It's Brown with one N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| There will be a long-term plan is to have a bridge over to the island| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| and a bridge across to the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| And there will be quite a few state park amenities put in this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| You didn't say anything about the conveyor, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| Okay, just making sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| That's what I wanted to ask you about was the bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| And that's what's included in what the state is going to be able to do that we haven't been able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| We would hope that that would be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| So I try to pull the cat back in the bag, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| Is the county planning to fund that bridge next year in the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| Yeah, and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| It will be the Schaus out-of-town bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| Yeah, the Ed Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| One-way bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| Is it going to be transparent so you can see down into the river as you go over it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| Yes, and there will be a teleporter for all you Star Trek fans, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| That bridge is so that if Dave and I want to have a meeting, we're closer to one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| I've lost control already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| I think there was federal dollars earlier at one point for the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| I'm not sure right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| But it is a fabulous piece of property of the 391 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| And Mr. Clausen, of course, bought a lot of it, a large portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| I believe the county under Tommy Shumpert purchased an adjacent parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| And if you hike it, there's up on the top of the hill, there is a Shumpert pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| It's a nice hike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| You can hike the whole thing in an hour or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| Commissioner Brolls and I have talked about an exploratory hike with some Girl Scouts several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3161)|
| 0:52:48| I hope we do that when the weather cools down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| But, anyway, it's a great piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| And much of it was funded privately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| Not on the taxpayer's nickel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| Now we can have a fishing tournament south rather than have to go to Concord Park all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| We've got a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| The next item is number 39, resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| It's authorizing commencement of the procedure for appointing the Knox County Auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| and providing for the interim operation of the Department of Internal Audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3203)|
| 0:53:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| A little bit of background and history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| The last audit committee meeting they had the discussion and approved to post the job for internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| And Tracy is going to oversee the audit function until we have a new auditor in place, full-time auditor in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3220)|
| 0:53:49| And I think what we've done is that there was some discussion at the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| or at the audit committee meeting about the pay scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| Mark Jones is going to have the people that are currently under contract with us conduct a small survey of like-sized counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3237)|
| 0:54:05| and municipalities about the pay range for internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| What I need consideration for or discussion about is we have one scale already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3249)|
| 0:54:17| but if we get that and it's an acceptable number or we find that we're within range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3257)|
| 0:54:23| I need permission to go ahead and get the job posting taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| and get it posted through the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| So consider that as part of our conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| That's part of this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| Commissioner McMahon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| You pretty much summed up what I was going to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| I'll just put my little two cents worth in, which I said last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| With the University of Tennessee there and lots of financial institutions here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| I'm hopeful we can, somebody, a Maximilian will be among the candidates that are looked at seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3292)|
| 0:54:59| And, of course, that's Dr. Colonel Julian's area, HR, that will, I'm assuming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| look at the names and the resumes and the background and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| And also, I'm not hung up and absolutely certain we'll have to pay a lot more money than we currently are paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3308)|
| 0:55:16| I'm no personnel expert, but I hope we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| Ninety-two thousand dollars is a lot of money in this economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| I think we were in the ballpark on some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| Could someone explain the process we're going through in selecting this person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| It is a commission appointment, but what is going to happen to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| how will the audit committee be involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| How will HR be involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| I'm interested in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| HR will obviously post the job and take resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| And then the audit committee will funnel those and pick one, two, no set number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3346)|
| 0:55:52| and bring those folks before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| I'm sorry, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| It's actually HR will narrow it down to three candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| And those three candidates go before the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| And then we send a recommendation on to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| Either we think this is the person, or we think these two are good, but maybe not this one so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| or maybe all three of them ranked in order of how we prefer them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| or maybe just say any of these three are fine, it's up to the commission now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| But HR will narrow it down to three before those three are sent on to audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| And then we do an interview and send it on to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| Who will be involved in HR in this selection process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| That I don't know, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| Any clarification on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| The reason I ask is this is a specialized field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| And I'm just wondering who all is going to be involved in the screening process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| and the interviewing process through HR for this position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| We're talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| I know myself and Colonel Julian will be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| And we were maybe thinking about bringing in one more expert, maybe from the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3413)|
| 0:56:59| Can you let us know when you have finalized that so that, you know, again, we're going to be hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| This is a commission employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| I just want to make sure that I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| I'm not against anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| I'm just saying I want to understand the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| and the process that you all are going through, the audit committee is going through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| and then what our responsibilities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| As Commissioner Broyles has stated, that's the way I understand the process is in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3438)|
| 0:57:25| So HR would have maybe a three-person, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| and then we would send the three candidates to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3451)|
| 0:57:38| But you will let us know who this third person is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| You said it would be you, Mr. Julian, and one other person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| You will let us know who that person is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| Somebody with an expertise in finance and possibly CPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| You care if it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| What I'd like to do is make sure that that person is not part of the, to make it, to separate them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| make it totally independent, make sure that person is not part of the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| Because the HR department is taking, in my personal opinion, I don't think anybody would do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| but there may be somebody there that the HR department, that the commission would want to interview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| that the HR department doesn't want to for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| It's our employee, and so we want to make sure, can we make sure that that person is independent of county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3500)|
| 0:58:27| or is that policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| No, I think that's open for your discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| Brad, I was going to make a substitute motion to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| that all three of those be brought before the commission rather than just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| They will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| It's going to be a recommendation from the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| All of them will be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| What they said the other day, that the audit committee would get down to the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| and make a recommendation to the commission of one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| I think all three of them need to be brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| I think you still make the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| Dr. Carsello specifically said it could be one, a priority list, or any of these are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| And so I think that's kind of how that was brought forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| I would love, I would prefer to see more than just one candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| I mean, you know, so we can properly vet everybody and, you know, there can be a recommendation, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| I like the idea that we have some type of outside person in the screening process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| so that the perception is not that it's kind of inside baseball and that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| we're really looking for the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| And I know we are, but I'm just saying I just want that perception to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| The other thing we talked about was this office itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| This is an opportunity now to see where the office is going, any improvements that may need to be made, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3571)|
| 0:59:38| Maybe the audit committee has already talked about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| about how if we need to tweak that office in any way and take a look at the workings of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| this would be an opportune time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| Go ahead, Amy, and answer that based on the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| And that was something we had talked about at the audit committee that when we do hire a new internal auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| we need to be very clear with he or she that what their expectations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| And we also need to make sure that we have adequate staff in place for them to meet those expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| So that's something that we definitely talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| And we're going to the important thing was to get the job opening posted as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3612)|
| 1:00:18| But our next audit committee, we're going to be talking more about that in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| And also, when we set up the date for the audit committee to interview the three candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| that the committee selects, I would certainly hope that all the county commissioners would come to that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| so that they can be part of that process from the very beginning as the audit committee interviews those three candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3633)|
| 1:00:40| We'd be there for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| And then if we need to have them come back for the commission work session, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| As far as a third-party outsider, I would make a recommendation that, you know, KPMG just did our last CAFR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3646)|
| 1:00:57| I would recommend that maybe we get one of their senior managers to come in and be that third person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3657)|
| 1:01:05| since KPMG is familiar with Knox County now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| But that might be a good suggestion for that third person to let them be an outsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| Would that not be a conflict of interest with Carcello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| No, because they aren't currently doing our audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| They have just wrapped up doing audits for us in the past, but they aren't currently working with the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| But they're working with him at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| No, I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| Different acronym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| KPMG is not through UTK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| KPMG is an independent international auditing company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| Well, I don't think you should limit just three coming to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| If they've got five people that they feel are equally qualified, then I think all five of those you all need to look at, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| I think you're misunderstanding something, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| We don't narrow it to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| The HR, no, the HR department narrows it down to three, and those three get sent to the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3711)|
| 1:01:59| and we interview those three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| If HR finds five rather than three, then those five all need to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| We'll work through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| You know, I guess I'm, and this is really just a question, or it will be a statement and a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3733)|
| 1:02:21| And my statement is, you know, the definition of insanity is, you know, doing the same thing over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3741)|
| 1:02:28| expecting a different result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| And my question is, and maybe there's no other good spot for them, but why do we have this department reporting to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3750)|
| 1:02:40| I think whoever the successful candidate is going to be is going to have a difficult job to do when the 11 of us are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3760)|
| 1:02:52| giving him or her direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| And I don't think any support, I don't think they need to report to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| because there needs to be some independence from the executive branch of this government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3779)|
| 1:03:07| But having them report to the legislative arm is not very independent either, and we can have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3787)|
| 1:03:14| I felt sent the auditor on wild goose chases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| and then part of the issues we had with the last one was that he wasn't doing audits that were very, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3798)|
| 1:03:25| cutting edge and needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| But I think he was trying to get a feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| I'm thinking for him at this point, so trying to get a feel for what this body was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| So I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| And my question is, has the Audit Committee ever considered having this position report to someone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3815)|
| 1:03:44| I just don't think this is the proper place for an independent, an IG type of an auditor to sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3824)|
| 1:03:51| I see Commissioner Briggs over there with his mic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| We don't have a choice on that because the charter says that the auditor works for the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3836)|
| 1:04:05| I'm just wondering if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| Okay, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| But, you know, I'm going to say there are ways around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| Maybe we could improve the process or look at somehow, something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| Can I clarify something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| Actually, and this is why one of the reasons we have an Audit Committee, the auditor does not report to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3855)|
| 1:04:22| The auditor reports to the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| And in the past, there was a problem with individual commissioners, especially when we had 19 of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3865)|
| 1:04:33| There were 19 commissioners, each one sending the internal auditor off to, you know, try to catch this or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3873)|
| 1:04:40| go lick into that because I'm going to harass so-and-so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| And that didn't do Richard any favors, and it wasn't a good way to run the audit department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3883)|
| 1:04:50| So having that Audit Committee as the buffer between the commission and the internal auditor, I think, achieves part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3890)|
| 1:05:01| And I think that, and we've had that before when somebody wanted to go look at the expenses at Knoxville Tourism Sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3901)|
| 1:05:09| Corporation and the automatic thing was turn around and ask, well, Richard, can you go do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3909)|
| 1:05:15| And we had to remind ourselves that, no, you can't just turn and ask the internal auditor to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| It has to go through the Audit Committee now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| And that's to protect the internal auditor from being somebody's political pawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| So I think that's a very important step, and that's why part of why the Audit Committee is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3927)|
| 1:05:34| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| I want to reiterate what Commissioner Schaaf said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| I've said several times in the community that they would like to see somebody from Knox County obtain this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| And, Mr. Chairman, you know, as another point, I'd like to see you involved in it there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| I think you need to definitely be on that committee, if at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| I know you'll be fair about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| I think the last several moments of conversation here will bear out my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3959)|
| 1:06:06| The internal auditor works for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3966)|
| 1:06:13| The Audit Committee spends four or five hours every other month as an extended arm of commission looking at auditing processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3973)|
| 1:06:27| So, as a member of the Audit Committee, I've said it many, many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| We don't make any decisions about the financial condition or auditing or investigation of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=3992)|
| 1:06:46| except with the direction of full commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| and we report only and fully to the commission of everything that we may become engaged in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4011)|
| 1:07:00| There's only one particular point I want to address about every how the candidates get before the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4020)|
| 1:07:12| If we find a dozen that are tied in qualification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4032)|
| 1:07:19| I would be the one voting that you, full commission, get to review all 12 candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| If there are only three that are viewed as possible successful candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4045)|
| 1:07:35| then you may receive those and only those three names in some order or only as here are three names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4055)|
| 1:07:45| And then the last statement is the most ironic of all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4065)|
| 1:07:51| Full commission does not have to choose from that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| Full commission can come up with its own candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| I believe I made that statement at the Audit Committee the other day as the extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| There may only be one person applied that we're agreeable upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| There may be several that we're in agreement upon as could be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| And it may be that full commission may select a completely different person for the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4096)|
| 1:08:23| So let me say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| Many, many times I've said the Audit Committee is your arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| We're just doing some of the legwork that the full commission ultimately is going to have to make a decision on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| Commissioner Wright and Brawls have pretty much summed it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| The Audit Committee doesn't make any decisions on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| It basically simply makes recommendations back to the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4124)|
| 1:08:50| And I think it does work pretty efficiently, especially compared, as Amy said, when there were 19, 19 bosses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4130)|
| 1:08:57| although I think technically it was the finance chair and the intergovernment chair that sort of gave the orders back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4137)|
| 1:09:03| And we know they were in a political battle with the current mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| That passed mayor back then, but that's another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| But it's a we love, we really appreciate when other people come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| Commissioner Brown has been to several meetings recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| Commissioner Norman attended quite a few, and we'd love for you to come and offer input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| But we simply make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| It's more practical to have three attending instead of 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| But we are certainly welcome and we would listen to and I'm sure respond to your input any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4170)|
| 1:09:39| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| Three or four points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| Point number one, Commissioner Brawls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| if you could ask them to have that interview process later in the afternoon as opposed to 9 or 10 o'clock in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| it would help those of us that have a difficult time getting here at 9 o'clock for those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| But I would like to come if we could have it later in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| Secondly, I was not on commission at the time, but was involved in the selection of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| or the whole concept of the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| There was a lot of discussion about who the internal auditor should report to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| And, of course, they agreed at the commission at the time that the mayor would not be a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| because she wanted to have the independence of that office be stated as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| There was also an idea floated that perhaps they could be like an inspector general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4216)|
| 1:10:21| and that they would be totally independent, not answering to anyone in government, be their own entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| But then some people wanted that office elected and some people said, no, it should be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| Well, you get into an election of an inspector general, politics enters into that like nobody's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4231)|
| 1:10:35| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| So that idea didn't float.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| And then it was said, well, commission handles the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| so commission should set up the department and the employee would report to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4239)|
| 1:10:45| Of course, that can all be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| If you want to look at a totally independent group, then you would need to change the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4247)|
| 1:10:52| and have that all set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| The other thing is that because of the political charge nature of that office a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| we sought guidance from the comptroller's office about how it should work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| It was the comptroller who came back and suggested that we do the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| and said it has worked well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| We would suggest you do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| He did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| I frankly think it's worked well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| And I think that it has taken a lot of the issues that we were having when Richard came to 19 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4272)|
| 1:11:19| and now we have the audit committee with two outside people and three commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| That seems to have worked well, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| And so that, just as a history lesson, is how we got to where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| But that's why I say now would be a good time to tweak it if we want to kind of tweak it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| and take a look at how we move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4297)|
| 1:11:37| I left something out there a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| Now that we're in the discussion of what's taking place, a part of the caption reads interim operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4300)|
| 1:11:51| Are we set on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| What is this interim operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| Well, what the discussion has been at the audit committee and then what I spoke with Tracy about is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4316)|
| 1:12:02| Tracy's going to handle the audit side of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| You'll go to Tracy for questions and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| And then, you know, for example, I think Joe Lee's signing their leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4327)|
| 1:12:14| and their work product as far as their administrative side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| And I get a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| And so Tracy's handling the audit side, and then Joe Lee is kind of overseeing the annual sick and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4340)|
| 1:12:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| So in keeping with only asking a question that you know the answer to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| we do have an internal auditor in place at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| Yes, Tracy is certainly qualified to handle what she needs to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| Interim invested with the power of this body to be the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4361)|
| 1:12:52| And Chairman Stem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| Go ahead, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| You said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| I think I just need to clarify HR's what our role is in this to make sure I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4376)|
| 1:13:04| As I read the ordinance, I believe that we are supposed to post the positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4384)|
| 1:13:10| collect the applications, and then we make a recommendation to the audit committee of the three best qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| I just got an underwriting ordinance, and that's exactly what the ordinance says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| So I don't know, Commissioner Ryde, if there would be more than three the way that's spelled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| But actually, the law director's discussion, the law director and I, you can recommend three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| but we don't have to take any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| So that would be the process there, the three that you recommend and we don't take any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4413)|
| 1:13:38| Then we would move on with the process again, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| That's why I suggested a while ago we change that and take that limit off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4420)|
| 1:13:46| That's a two-month ordinance change, so we'd have to have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| Commissioner, I think Commissioner Boyle has her line open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| This is just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| Actually, Mark, I'm not done yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| This is a question for Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| I just have a question in relation to Mike's suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4440)|
| 1:14:06| When you do, when you post job openings for other departments, is that normally how it operates, that you post the notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4446)|
| 1:14:13| take the applications, and then, like, if you're doing something for the health department or the finance department or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| you recommend to them three possibilities and they choose from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| Or is it different from every department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| The basic procedure would be that we would get the applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| We would screen the applications for making sure that they met the requirements for the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4470)|
| 1:14:36| and then we would send them to the department or the department that requested them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| And you said that our procedure is spelled out in ordinance, so we can't tweak it much without having to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4482)|
| 1:14:49| You'd have to change the ordinance to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| Mr. Law Director, is that a substantial change from go to three to five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| It would be on this ordinance because the ordinance is a procedure itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| and it's very specifically enumerated as to what the procedure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| So if you wanted to change it, you'd have to change the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| Which takes two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| Commissioner Wright's comment about the interim just prompted a final statement from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4512)|
| 1:15:17| If there were to be a need and you ever know when they come along for a quick response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| and we've had the mulch, Beck, tourism, most recently, trustee exit audit for trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4521)|
| 1:15:28| We do have a provision with a peeing company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| There's an open contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4532)|
| 1:15:33| They can get two or three auditors in the building in a matter of hours or wherever it may be, a school or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4533)|
| 1:15:39| So we're not flying blind and waiting for three months for an auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| We could do that virtually immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| Mr. Law Director, is there any reason why that we can't have access to all of the applications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4550)|
| 1:16:00| I don't see the reason why you can't have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| The procedure is you will get three recommendations from the audit committee through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| You can accept those, reject those, pull those three back out, do the cycle again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4570)|
| 1:16:17| Right now, the procedure is set up to where the applications go to HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| They pick three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| The audit committee can send you one, two or three of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| You can accept them or reject them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| If you reject them, then you, in my mind, you'd go through the cycle again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4589)|
| 1:16:34| And there you'd be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| Which takes another ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| But what I'm saying is here that if you've got five or six that are that close, then they need a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4597)|
| 1:16:48| Well, they've been looked at by HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| And it's been pointed out before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| We can pick somebody who's not on their number three list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4613)|
| 1:16:59| You can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| But if we don't have them, we can't see who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| Well, they can send you all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| But in the end, what I'm saying is from the procedural standpoint, HR will have to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4626)|
| 1:17:12| They send three to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| The audit committee sends their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| That's the process you all set in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| You know, that's kind of where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| I don't make the ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| I just tell you what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4643)|
| 1:17:28| I just don't want us to be limited to three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| Those are the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| I think before we get all excited about this, we ought to see how many people apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| We might not have more than three people who want this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| All right, we have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| The next item is not listed on the agenda, but it has been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| It's Resolution 805, Determining the Method of Disposal of Property Owned by Knott's County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| and Located at 3106 Waterplant Road to be by Negotiated Exchange and Sale with Tracy K. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4685)|
| 1:18:13| Rufus Haynes Smith III, James Thomas Smith, and Rufus H. Smith, Jr. and Company, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4693)|
| 1:18:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4703)|
| 1:18:24| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| Dwight, can you come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| This is part of the discussion with the Carnes and Carter Convenience Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4708)|
| 1:18:36| So, Dwight, if you'll probably do it a lot better than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| This is actually a companion resolution to one that will be before commission next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| that approves the actual exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| We're going to be back before you next month with a proposal to swap 3.99 acres of the property that Knox County owns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4728)|
| 1:18:56| for the purpose of the river industrial park for 3.99 acres that Smith built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4736)|
| 1:19:03| or Rocky Smith and the other folks that you see in this resolution own in Carnes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| which is the one site we've been able to identify after a truly, truly exhaustive search that's suitable for a convenience center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4748)|
| 1:19:16| to replace the one that presently is in Carnes, which is leased property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| That's a center I think you've heard me say over the years that we desperately need to close and to relocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4760)|
| 1:19:26| It's a property we found and liked and we attempted to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| We were unable to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| But eventually we learned through those negotiations that these folks had an interest in the Forks of the River site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4772)|
| 1:19:37| Our property is worth more than theirs is, so we are swapping the acreage 3.99 even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4777)|
| 1:19:44| And then they're interested in buying the additional remainder that will be left behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| They have agreed to grant us an easement for three years to permit us to operate the center that's there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4790)|
| 1:19:58| But as I've told the district commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| it is our plan eventually to close the Forks of the River Center and expand and improve the Carter Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| So at the end of the day, as all of this comes to pass over the next year or year and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| we will have seven convenience centers instead of eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| We will own the real property under all seven centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| And all of them will have the acreage location and access that we need to make a good center that works and works well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4817)|
| 1:20:24| What you've got today is the approval for the method of exchange or sale of the property that purchasing has put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4824)|
| 1:20:32| I think I'd be better suited to let Mr. Holt speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| But this is a culmination of a lot of work that purchasing and solid waste have put into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| and I hope you'll give it every consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| I just want to thank you and Mr. Sturkey and the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4848)|
| 1:20:54| This and the next month's resolution for the negotiated, we're going to sell some property, trade some property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4854)|
| 1:21:03| lease some property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| And so that has probably everything that the county can do with a piece of property in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| And they've woven it into one deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| And we're actually going to save a tremendous amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| and be able to build the convenience centers almost two for one close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| So, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| And not only does it correct a situation that exists in your district, which is a definite safety hazard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4881)|
| 1:21:31| because I was fussing about Carter whenever I went and drove by yours and said, well, yours is number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| But the plan that has been developed here not only solves the issue that we have before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4897)|
| 1:21:45| we get two convenience centers at a well-reduced cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4905)|
| 1:21:53| And the only person affected is sitting at the other corner of the table down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| and he'll just have to take his convenience center traffic to a different location, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4917)|
| 1:22:05| So, we have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=4927)|

| 1:24:10| Is there any we had that kind of discussion about that today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| Is there any further topics about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| Item 46, Discussion regarding the reasons why Johnny Hahn has not paid any money toward his embezzlement of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5059)|
| 1:24:25| from the Knox County Trustee's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| I have one year left on this body, and I will not leave until that money is collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| And so I intend to bring it up every single month until we get our money, so just so everybody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5074)|
| 1:24:41| It's been five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| We haven't gotten a penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| And so I want to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| I know that when we had the bonding issues come up, that that was the reason we have a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5086)|
| 1:24:53| So my question is, Mr. Lowe was bonded and the other, Mr. Sisk was bonded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5093)|
| 1:25:00| Can we not go to the bonding company and say we want our money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5100)|
| 1:25:07| I mean, why do we have a bond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| Because it seems to me that this is why you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| Yes, please, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| Well, first off, what we know in the public and what we legally know is two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5115)|
| 1:25:21| We have to wait until we are sure that someone is guilty before we can go after a bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5121)|
| 1:25:27| for some damages that may or may not have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| So to answer your question, no, we can't go after it right now because we have no we can't prove we haven't proven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5132)|
| 1:25:40| that that's where the harm has come from, the one that has the bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| In terms of Mr. Hahn's situation, we have a he is cooperating in terms of the Mr. Lowe case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5145)|
| 1:25:55| and that trial will be supposedly it's on the docket for April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| So maybe we can get it before you get out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| There's no guarantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| But the actual money related to that account is in the custody and control of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5165)|
| 1:26:11| It is not going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| And during the period since we last talked, hopefully this will make you happier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| The account itself has grown by over $20,700 to the benefit of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5180)|
| 1:26:27| The other part of that issue is the reason we want to keep that out there is we're waiting to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5187)|
| 1:26:38| whether Mr. Hahn is going to be pleading to a felony once this is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5198)|
| 1:26:44| and that's going to be on hold until the Lowe trial is over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5204)|
| 1:26:51| That has a big bearing on our tax consequences of what we collect out of his account or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5211)|
| 1:26:57| and how that will be distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| Also, at the same time, we have to have some clarity as to what part of his contribution is legitimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5219)|
| 1:27:06| and what part of his contribution may or may not be fraudulent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| which will also have a bearing on how we credit toward him out of this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5230)|
| 1:27:15| So I wish it was as easy as we want it to be, both you and I, Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| that we could just have him write the check and we go on our merry way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| But right now he is a number in a bigger equation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5244)|
| 1:27:30| and the law department is going to wait until the math comes out on all of these cases to get to the best benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5250)|
| 1:27:38| of the Knox County taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| How much money does he owe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| It's in excess, I think, is it 200?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| You know off the top of your head, David, it's over 200-something thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| And he has admitted that he took this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| I mean, he has said he took it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| He's pleaded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| He said he's guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| So we know that he owes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| We know how much he owes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| My concern, and, again, I'm not a legal eagle, but as we go through this legal process, if a deal is cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5284)|
| 1:28:12| I want to make sure that will they come to Knox County with the deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| Here's my bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| I don't want a deal cut where it comes in and says, well, we're just going to forgive the money that you owe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| No, that's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| So I want it on the record that, indeed, this comes in, and I don't want to get involved in legal proceedings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| but I know that he has said he took it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| He has admitted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5311)|
| 1:28:32| It's 200-some thousand dollars of our money, and we haven't gotten a dime yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| And I leave this body August 31, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| I want our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| Well, where we are, we have the money is committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5322)|
| 1:28:48| The agreements have not been completed on the other side yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5328)|
| 1:28:55| The actual money involved that we have is in the custody and control of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5335)|
| 1:29:01| and will not be released to anybody without a directive from the Knox County Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5341)|
| 1:29:06| So that money is like in Knox County's bank, but it's just not in our general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5346)|
| 1:29:14| The legal issues are how do we credit it when we take it, and what are the tax consequences when we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5354)|
| 1:29:20| And that can only be cleared up once it's been adjudicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| So the money is not going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| It will not be released to anyone without the approval of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5367)|
| 1:29:32| I can guarantee you that unless they steal it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| Then there will be another ballgame going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| And I know that this wears on everybody, but it wears on me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| And, like I say, I'm on a mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| So just so everybody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| I just wanted to say thank you to Commissioner Hammond for keeping this up and in our consciousness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5388)|
| 1:29:55| I appreciate that you're making it an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| Along the same lines of what Commissioner Hammond was saying, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| would it not be in this man's best interest to go ahead and pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5403)|
| 1:30:11| Then when he goes to court in front of the judge, I have paid, you know, Your Honor, before sentencing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5411)|
| 1:30:17| I have paid what I owed back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| It looks like that would go easier on the guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| Well, technically he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| It's encrusted in control of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| It's the distribution part that we have a problem to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5425)|
| 1:30:28| and how much credit of that money that he gets toward what he owes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5428)|
| 1:30:34| It's not a matter of whether we get all the money or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| We have all the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| It's how do we distribute that money, how is that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5438)|
| 1:30:42| when that money actually comes into the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| what portion of that money has federal income tax liens against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| what portion of that money is legitimately credited to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| We still get it if it's not credited to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| But all of this has to be determined and adjudicated so that we can give the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| I mean, he may owe us in excess of $200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| but he may not get credit for all of the money in that account toward what he owes us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| Then we'll know what else we have to go after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| But we'll still get the total dollar figure because some of it actually belongs to Knox County anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5473)|
| 1:31:19| and shouldn't be credited to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| And we're waiting on this adjudication to determine that, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| for lack of a better word, co-mingling of money and what proportion goes where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| and how much of it legitimately should he get credit for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| and how much of it is exposed to taxes and how much of it is going to be net against his account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5494)|
| 1:31:41| But all of it will come to Knox County in the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| It's a matter of accounting against his liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| And then we will know then what else we, as a community, are going to go after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5508)|
| 1:31:57| Over the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| Item 47, update on possible realignment of commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5521)|
| 1:32:06| I had put this on the agenda because I believe it was last year that we said we wanted to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5526)|
| 1:32:11| at, you know, maybe redoing the commission districts, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| I'm just kind of wondering where we are with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5535)|
| 1:32:21| I don't know that anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| It would have to be a charter amendment to do any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5544)|
| 1:32:33| Well, I guess my point is, if we haven't done anything, it looks like we haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| You know, time is clicking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5558)|
| 1:32:39| If we're going to do something, because we said we would, what I don't want to do is to have all of a sudden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| it shows up on the agenda and we're expected to vote on it in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| That's not fair to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5568)|
| 1:32:49| And so that's why I'm bringing it up now to see where we are with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| I'll get the dates from the election commission to see when it would be required to be printed for the April primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5572)|
| 1:33:02| I'm going to comment, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| I think it's going good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5584)|
| 1:33:05| Lined up the school board and the county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| I've not heard really any complaints in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| Yeah, and that's why I'm trying to figure out where the commission support for redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5592)|
| 1:33:17| I don't think that's happening yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| I know we discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| We maybe had a couple of meetings over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| But I don't know that there's a support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| I just said I would get the date for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| I'm not supporting it because I think it needs to stay where it's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| Yeah, I agree with Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| I think we went through a pretty exhaustive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| And it's working well for the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| Well, we haven't went through a term yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| I mean, we haven't even fully completed a term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| So I'm not willing to cast my vote toward changing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| Any other items before the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5628)|

| 1:33:58| Parks and Recreation is holding their awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| And it's here in the assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| And Dick Sporting Good is hosting their reception in the small assembly room right after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| And they'd like for us to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| Parks and Recreation does a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| And this is for recognizing their volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5652)|

| 1:34:39| So we'd love for you guys to join us for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5679)|

| 1:34:49| And I think some of the school board will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| Most of the state delegation will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| And I think 10 of us are going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| Nine or 10 of us have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5696)|

| 1:35:02| I think Ron has to be somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| Any other announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130916?start=5704)|
