| 0:00:43| And Commissioner Biggs is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=43)|
| 0:00:46| Just as a point of clarification, has Commissioner Bessler left or is he downstairs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=46)|
| 0:00:50| He's downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=50)|
| 0:00:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=51)|
| 0:00:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=52)|
| 0:00:53| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=53)|
| 0:00:54| Madam Clerk, could you read the next item for consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=54)|
| 0:00:57| Item number 37 is consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=57)|
| 0:01:02| amending the Knox County Code, Chapter 54, by adding a new article for entitled, Sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=62)|
| 0:01:08| Construction Standards for New Commercial Developments and Residential Developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=68)|
| 0:01:13| Greater than 5 Lots, to establish the location requirements and general specifications of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=73)|
| 0:01:20| the installation of sidewalks in new developments or redevelopments permitted in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=80)|
| 0:01:26| This is the Knox County Code, Chapter 54, Article 4, previously reserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=86)|
| 0:01:31| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| This is Ordinance O-19-12-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| All right, thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=93)|
| 0:01:40| Before this one comes up, I know it's a second reading, but I do want to recognize the sponsor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| of this, which was Mr. Snowden from Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| I think he'd share that he wanted to comment on this one before we discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| I appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| I just had a few, I guess, commentary I'd like to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| You know, we've talked a lot about this, so I did kind of want to circle back around to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| the original, I guess, the origin of the issue for us, which is an ordinance approved by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=122)|
| 0:02:09| this body would allow us to adjust the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| As the MPC subdivision regulations currently state, as it relates to pedestrian circulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| systems, and I'll just read this, I think it's pretty important, it says, as it relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=139)|
| 0:02:25| to sidewalk improvements, any required sidewalk shall be provided by the developer in accordance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| with the design and construction standards of the City of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=150)|
| 0:02:35| The next section states, within the City of Knoxville, the developer should contact the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| City of Knoxville Department of Engineering regarding applicable requirements and design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| standards from the City's adopted ordinances and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| I will not read you what the county's stipulations are, because they're four paragraphs long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=168)|
| 0:02:55| and essentially it says that within the county, my department doesn't have the same discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| as the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| In lieu of that discretion is applied to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| So the Planning Commission and their staff are making recommendations about sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| on county roadways, and we feel like that we're more qualified to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| We have the budgetary responsibility to maintain those and install those, and we feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| that we're more uniquely qualified to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| So I did want to mention that, and at last month's meeting, Backwalk Knoxville talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| about some of their concerns, and we have examined their proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=212)|
| 0:03:39| We concur with some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| The main issue, I'll go through it just briefly here, they would like, as part of their proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=221)|
| 0:03:50| sidewalks along one side of the street if residential streets have a posted speed limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| of 25 miles an hour or greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| We concur with that, primarily because we don't anticipate or really want any of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| streets to be greater than 25 miles an hour in a residential setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| However, if the rare case would present itself, we do feel like that that would be a reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| request, so we do concur with that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| The next one that they presented was speed limit is 25 miles per hour or less and has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=258)|
| 0:04:26| a traffic greater than 1,000 trips per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| We agree partially with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| We feel like that there are certain instances where roadways that have 1,000 ADT would benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=274)|
| 0:04:41| from having sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| We feel like those locations are where you're within that quarter mile of commercial or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=283)|
| 0:04:50| parks or within the PRZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| Otherwise, then you're essentially building a sidewalk on a street that serves 1,000 cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| a day, but it doesn't connect anything once you get to the main street, which we feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| like is not necessarily appropriate or effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| And then we agree with their other concerns as it relates to their proposal number three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=308)|
| 0:05:18| or, pardon me, proposal number one, third item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| Their second proposal is in regard to installing sidewalks along the development's frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=323)|
| 0:05:30| of existing roadways in all conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| We do not agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| We think that it is wise to install sidewalks along these situations where it's in the PRZ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| or it's within a quarter mile of a commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| We once again feel like if you're building sidewalks in all locations outside those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| it essentially creates sidewalk linkages that we have to maintain that will most likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| never be connected to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| So we feel like that's not maybe the wisest use of our taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| The last thing that they discussed was their proposal regarding narrower streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=363)|
| 0:06:12| We don't agree with that proposal either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| We feel like that the 26-foot wide street is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| It does allow for on-street parking, which we think is necessary in some instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| And we feel like a more appropriate way in which to reduce speeds is through geometric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| design related to horizontal and vertical alignment that we're actually already somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=390)|
| 0:06:37| doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| The MPC's requirements are a 100-foot minimum or centerline radius curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| We're allowing some of those to be reduced in certain areas to slow traffic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| We've actually allowed a developer to go to a zero radius curve and put in a mini roundabout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=409)|
| 0:06:56| to allow for some slower traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| We feel like those are more appropriate means in which to do so rather than reducing width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| It's my experience reducing width is not necessarily as related to speed reduction as you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| If you can see what's ahead of you in a long distance, that typically is more related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| driver speed than anything in our opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| So we would ask you to approve the ordinance with those minor changes that we've discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=443)|
| 0:07:31| I emailed all this to you earlier today, so hopefully you've had a chance to take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| at it and certainly welcome any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| We also, going back to the very beginning of tonight, we had several folks who signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| up for public forum related to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| And I told all of them that A, we'll allow you to speak at this time when this comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| So I do want to call on, I believe we had Sherry Raymond and Brenda Patton and Caroline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=473)|
| 0:08:04| Cooley, each expressed an interest in speaking on this item at public forum earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=484)|
| 0:08:11| So in order of when we receive the notice, is Sherry, forgive me if I'm pronouncing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| wrong, Sherry Raymond or Ray-mand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| Is Sherry here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| Is Brenda Patton, P-A-T-T-O-N, here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| Is Brenda here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| No, she left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| And Caroline Cooley, I see that you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| Hi there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| Caroline Cooley, 903 Wingate Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| Here we are again, 930 at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| And a lot of people that came that wanted to speak have left because they just didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| have the endurance to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| I do have a few slides because I do have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| I thank Mr. Snowden for continuing to work with us and trying to find some common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=540)|
| 0:09:09| But I also want to have, I still have a few issues as far as his point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=549)|
| 0:09:17| And so I just want to show you some pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| I don't know, how do I tell you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| First, back up to the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| I just want to reiterate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| I've sent you letters, I've sent you information that Bike Walk Knoxville advocates for biking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| and walking in the Knoxville region for all ages and all abilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| We are not about just people living in subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| We are talking about people, this is a public health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| This is not an amenity that we just, oh, sidewalks are just for certain people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=583)|
| 0:09:50| We are in the middle of a public health crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| We, from all our obesity epidemic, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=594)|
| 0:10:04| the responsibility of government to protect, to try to help people achieve better health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=604)|
| 0:10:12| Our public, our built environment has so much impact on our outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=612)|
| 0:10:20| I'm a physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| I've been, I practice medicine for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| I have seen this personally and it's just overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| The mortality rates are increasing for middle-aged people because of these chronic diseases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| Our life expectancies are going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| If you have any issue with that, I can give you the literature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| It's well documented from the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| And when people cannot get out and move around in their own environment, then they don't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=646)|
| 0:10:54| They just get in a car or they sit at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| So, sorry, next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| We were talking about how far is a fourth of a mile versus a half a mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=660)|
| 0:11:07| as far as whether a development needed frontage road sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=667)|
| 0:11:14| And the map that was provided by Mr. Snowden for you was downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| which is not applicable to most of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| So I wanted to point out, this one is from the Choteau roundabout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| which is great to have, where there is a good hub, a little hub, a commercial activity now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| There's a Don Gallo's, there's a Weigel's, there's I think a service station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| And as you can see from this one, there's the subdivision that's just a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=699)|
| 0:11:47| it's .4 miles, 8 minutes walking time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| And that subdivision would not, if it was being built now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| would not have a sidewalk on the frontage road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| And that is an easy walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| It would be nice to be able to walk from there down and eat dinner at Don Gallo's and walk back home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| It's not that complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| Going the other way, same roundabout, up to Preston Landing Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| It's a 7 minute walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| It's .3 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| And once again, .3 miles is more than a quarter of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| And would not require sidewalk in front of that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| And you can see there's subdivisions all around in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| So it's not like we're building sidewalks to nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| There's subdivisions all around this roundabout, this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=758)|
| 0:12:45| So I just wanted to point that out, that one quarter of a mile is just not much distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=765)|
| 0:12:52| Most people are happy to walk 10 minutes to a destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=772)|
| 0:12:59| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| Examples of road width and other design elements that affect motorist speed, walking safety, and comfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=781)|
| 0:13:10| There is a lot of literature, a lot of literature that shows that a narrow street with shorter block length,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=790)|
| 0:13:18| and of course this is an older street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| We're all familiar with our old neighborhood streets that seem more comfortable when you're out walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| Because the speed limits are still the same as those in the subdivision roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| But the person driving down the upper roads sees a clearer line of sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=813)|
| 0:13:40| It's a wide road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| And no matter if it's posted at 25 miles per hour, they feel comfortable driving faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| So it makes it less safe for the people that are trying to walk or bike or be kids in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| Sometimes kids love to be out in the street and play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| And they aren't necessarily paying attention to the speed of the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| In fact, they have a hard time judging speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| And the lower one is, of course, a more established neighborhood, but with a much narrower road width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=844)|
| 0:14:12| The blocks are short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| So drivers are looking for those, they're aware there may be cars, vehicles, coming from the side streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=854)|
| 0:14:21| So they're going to go slower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| And there may or may not be a sidewalk over there on the, but I think there's no sidewalks on this street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=863)|
| 0:14:30| So, and this has been shown over and over in the literature now, that the narrow streets do provide some safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=870)|
| 0:14:39| There are other ways to do traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| I have no problem with other methods to do traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| But I can assure you that wide streets that have a clear line of sight with no cross sections, people do drive faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=885)|
| 0:14:54| And we all know that posted speed limits, no one enforces them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| It's very rare that they get enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| They're not, it's even rare to get enforcement in speed zone, in school speed zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| Because there's so few officers that are available to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| I just want, we can put a little humor into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| Where do we need sidewalks in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| Look where the Dollar Generals are located, and you will see the trodden paths of the shoppers who do not drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=922)|
| 0:15:29| These, you don't see them in Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| You don't see them in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| You see them in the neighborhoods where people cannot afford a car, don't have a car, and they still need to buy groceries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=934)|
| 0:15:43| They need to get the essentials of daily life, and that's where Dollar Generals look to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=943)|
| 0:15:53| Because they know the people that are going to be their customers are the ones that are walking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| And the next one, slide please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| And where else do we need sidewalks in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| We need to look at the streets and school parental responsibility zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| And those, of course, are one mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| And we do, and this, you know, I agree that we need to have the sidewalks on the frontage roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=972)|
| 0:16:20| I think we need the sidewalks on every frontage road because developers are going to build next to other developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=980)|
| 0:16:28| They're not interested in going out and putting a development out in the middle of the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| They're interested in where they think the growth is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| And they're looking at the areas around schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| Our schools will eventually end up in the more densely developed areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| So we feel that if you're going to put the sidewalks on the frontage roads, they should be on all developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1004)|
| 0:16:52| And then, obviously, eventually maybe have sidewalks connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| And, of course, we need sidewalks close to neighborhood parks and other places that people like to walk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1017)|
| 0:17:05| And I think that's my last slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| Oh, I want to just mention again that this is from the CDC about how much the built environment impacts health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1029)|
| 0:17:22| And why we need to have the built environment approaches to increase physical activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| so that people can just get out of their houses and go take a walk, go take a bike ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1048)|
| 0:17:35| And I love the Greenway Plan, but it still does not, it's corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| And how do you get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| And what do you do when you still have to drive several miles to get to those greenways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| And it's very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| So I would like to propose that we look at this ordinance and have more education, study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1071)|
| 0:18:03| and maybe have a better ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| Come up with something else that might be still financially feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| but also beneficial to more residents of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| Thank you, Ms. Cooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| Is there anyone else who would like to speak on this subject that maybe did not sign up at public forum earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Sir, if you could please approach the podium and just state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1112)|
| 0:18:39| Hello, I'm Don Lindsey, and I'm at 5312 Trace Manor Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| Thank you all for hanging in there with us very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| I've spent a lot of years dealing with traffic safety in my previous career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| I might take a little bit of personal discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| I have a former working relationship with Mr. Lindsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| He's a legend at AAA, recently retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| And thank you for your service to the community through your years of service at AAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| It was a great pleasure, and I enjoyed working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| I haven't spoken of this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| I didn't even see in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| I'm sorry, Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Have you heard all his jokes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| Have you heard all his jokes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| Well, if he starts up with them, I may have to leave early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| But other than that, I have heard a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| But I'm here tonight to also encourage that we try to stretch the limit a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1165)|
| 0:19:32| You all have some very tough decisions to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| There's limited funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| There's lots of calls for those funds, and you have a lot to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| But the more we can stretch the availability of choices for people in transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1181)|
| 0:19:48| the better off we're going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| We do have the health crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| There's no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| And we do have also a traffic injury and fatality crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| In the state of Tennessee, in the five years starting in 2014 through 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| pedestrian fatalities rose in three of those five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| We went from 89 in 2014 to 137 in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| And in Knox County, we bounced around between 79 and 109 traffic incidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1215)|
| 0:20:23| pedestrian incidents, in Knox County in those same five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| And according to the TPO, we have, of those incidents, 34 percent of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1228)|
| 0:20:36| more than a third were where there was not an alternate or a safe space for people to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1236)|
| 0:20:43| So we have this situation going on out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| and I know that this is not something that anybody's ignoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| I wouldn't want to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| If we can, let's see if we can't stretch things a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| Let's see if we can't give people more choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| and move perhaps that quarter mile to a third of a mile or a half a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| or something like that, if we can make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| There is ample evidence as well that, well, let's take a look at two populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1267)|
| 0:21:15| Every day today, for instance, 10,000 people turned 65 in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1275)|
| 0:21:23| Every day for the next, I think it's about 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| 10,000 people are going to turn 65 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| And that's fantastic. That means we're living longer. We're doing better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| But it also means that a number of those folks are going to want to stop driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| They're still able to get around, but they need to stop driving or want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| And that means there needs to be alternatives for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| One of those alternatives is walking, but it needs to be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| Another population, young adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| There is ample evidence from surveys that young adults basically want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| the same kind of safe living conditions as do older adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| It's funny, we want the same kinds of things. You wouldn't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| But we do want neighborhoods to be walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| We want to be able to get to places easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| Many of the young adults don't want to own a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| And if Knox County is not available for them in that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| maybe they choose someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| So there are several reasons to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| If we can find some way to start moving away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| without doing any kind of harsh big jump or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| let's look for simple, small ways, steadily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| to give people more choices in transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| And sidewalks are a great start for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| And I'll be happy to answer any questions if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| If not, I'll refer to the chairman for jokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1372)|
| 0:23:00| Moving on, I do want to recognize two commissioners that have questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| or need additional information on this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| In order, Commissioner Jay followed by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| Yes, sir, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| What are more expensive, sidewalks or greenways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| Depends on the width of the greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| but five feet of concrete is typically more expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| than a ten-foot-wide greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| So it's probably, sidewalks probably do weigh out a little more in excess expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| We spent some time this week talking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| and I asked for some examples in how you might work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| a development whereby money that would otherwise be spent inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1429)|
| 0:23:57| would be helped applied to other sidewalk-related items around the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| Do you remember this conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| Could you help explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| Because I'm not going to do it justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| but I bring that up because I think it's a perfect example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| about how this isn't a one-size-fits-all approach necessarily across Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1451)|
| 0:24:18| There are times where you analyze the best use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| the best for all versus a one particular project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| that doesn't necessarily fit in the exact same box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| That's very accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| And actually, that's codified in the ordinance under item D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| It gives us, in my department, the availability to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| in lieu of the developer where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| in an instance where sidewalk may be required along his frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| but let's say that particular development is maybe on the outstretches of that PRZ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1489)|
| 0:24:56| or in another location that we don't feel like would be anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| that we would get to for a long period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| we can get that developer to give us the same amount of funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1504)|
| 0:25:11| that it would take to build that sidewalk per the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| and actually take those funds and put them in another location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| that maybe is closer in to the PRZ or that commercial node| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| and actually use those proceeds from that development offsite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| onto another location that would benefit more residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| So this gives you that allowance to make those decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| It does, and we've had conversations with planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| and the developers about that, and that's been receptive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| because they see the benefit of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| Can you also, when you started your remarks tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| you talked about on the city side of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| the flow is development and then meeting with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| and then going through planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| but on the county side, it's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| It's development to planning and then to county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| For this bigger discussion about sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| have there been the processes that the city follows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| which obviously most of the city is quite developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| but there's still lots of areas that are not full sidewalked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| Has there been major objections to how they do business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| that you're aware of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| Not to my knowledge, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| Do you have a similar staff team expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1591)|
| 0:26:38| in your engineering and public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| as they do in their engineering and public works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| Is it fairly comparable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| I would argue that my traffic engineering staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| is more competent than theirs, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| I take a lot of pride in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| We have the memo I sent you all today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| We have over 80 years of experience in traffic operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| so I would think that we do as good a job if not better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| than the city engineering folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| Does this ordinance essentially align you with the same process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| as would be the city is already operating in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| That's why we would like to pass this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| to have that same consideration that the city currently has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| I also asked you for some...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| Sorry to put you through the wringer this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| because I asked for a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| I asked for just an understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| of cost infrastructure when it comes to sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| And because we had Mr. Murphy with us last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| and we spent a lot of time talking about people walking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| I think there's actually a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| There may be a Dollar General or a Weigels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| at Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| at the corner of Washington Pike and Murphy Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| and we had a lot of discussion about Shannon Valley Farms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| and the number of developments, Summer Rose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| and all of that area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| So I said, just out of curiosity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| if you could tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| if Knox County right now decided to put a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| to allow for infrastructure and accessibility for pedestrians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| on Murphy Road between Tazewell Pike and Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| and did appropriate crossings at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| I believe there's a Montessori school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| a couple of neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| and that'll include some of the commercial areas of Weigels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| and that area at Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| And if we just decided tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| to appropriate that and go for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| what would that cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| And how long would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| And I just want to go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| It's about a mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| so it was a little over 5,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| well, 5,400 feet is what you measured it at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| And what you said to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| was a conservative estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| of engineering right-of-way acquisition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| construction costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| the sidewalk is expected to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| about $250 per foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| And so that brings the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| of this one-mile stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| to about $1,350,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| But if you added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| medium crosswalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| other pedestrian accesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| et cetera, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| it brings the total cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| of a one-mile stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| to $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| Even if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| over or under by a few hundred thousand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| it's a significant investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| And I started to just kind of do the math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| with Knox County's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| If you take our budget of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| $820,000, $30,000, $50,000...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| It'll probably be over $860,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| $860,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| Sorry, just off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| If you took our total Knox County budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| and you took out schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| if you took out sheriff and jails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| if you took out engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| and public works and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| the health department, our top four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| departments, that doesn't include,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| this would not include taking into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| parks and rec, mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| libraries, anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| The county, if you took all of those things out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| the county runs on about $100 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| Rough ballpark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| of what's left after all of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| four major infrastructure things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| So one-mile stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| on one area that is absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| pedestrian safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| Talking about taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| 1.5% of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| the budget that this county operates on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| and putting one mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| in. That should just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| sort of underline the economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| I'm a huge believer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| in greenway infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| I am working on one in North Shore that is all about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| pedestrian safety. It's all about keeping people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| from getting killed on that really busy road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| And I really do think that we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| adopt and we should really invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| in a long-term plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| to take our study to invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| in greenways that would really connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| neighborhoods and connect areas like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| But there's also an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| economic reality to saying what we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| and what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| And this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| we're miles away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| We're eons away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| from the reality of being able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| to do this all together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| at one fell swoop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| I just say that to say I'm a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| big believer in pedestrian safety and I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| ought to invest in more greenways. But it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| economically viable for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| just start dropping down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| And in this ordinance, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| that one of the biggest tools you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| have is to say it's not a one-size-fits-all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| approach. And if we can take private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| dollars and sometimes apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| them over here to public infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| it's going to help more people than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| just require every single thing to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| exactly the same across 500 square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| miles. It's not like the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| We have three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| different biospheres. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| Corryton and we have Cedar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| Bluff and we have Hardin Valley and those are three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| different worlds all together in the same bubble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| I'm not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| coming to a point, but it was a lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| this week and I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| trust our engineering and public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| to take the steps to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| go forward. I'm just not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| sure how many steps we can take because we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| the economic ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| jump. We've got to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| crawling a little bit first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| Thank you for your time. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| Thank you, Commissioner Jay. Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| Yeah, I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| all of the comments that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| heard tonight are all relevant. Everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| telling the truth. Everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| is on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| But I think the reality is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| the first step in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Dr. Cooley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| made the statement that she wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| to move forward. I think the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| step in this process should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| to adopt this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| ordinance as amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| by Mr. Snowden that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| we got this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| I will make a motion that we adopt the ordinance as amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| We have a motion from Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| Anders with a second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Brad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| could you please restate the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| and then I want to go back to you because this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| second reading and I want to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| changes that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| to your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| It's the changes that Mr. Snowden brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| up earlier that he had sent out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| in regards to some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| things that he had acquiesced to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| that he spoke of earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| Jim, if you'd mind to come up and talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| the amendments. You can restate that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| Yeah, I'll be glad to. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| trying to be brief earlier. I know it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| Yeah, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| and essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| going down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| BikeWalk Knoxville's proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| they did ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| for if and when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| a residential street has a posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| speed limit greater than 25 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| an hour, the sidewalks be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| required on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| of the street. We concur with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| we don't anticipate residential streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| to be greater than 25, but if in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| odd event one of them does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| those conditions, we do think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| The second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| revision would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| be in locations where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| the speed limit is 25 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| an hour or less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| and there are greater than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| 1,000 vehicle trips per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| We feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| their original proposal had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| it to be on all streets that met that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| criteria. Our suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| alternative would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| be to only put those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| sidewalks on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| one side of the street where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| the ADTs are greater than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| 1,000 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| the subdivision itself is within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| one quarter mile of pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| generators or within the PRZ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| so that the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| internal would also connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| with an external sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| The rest of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| would remain the same. There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| were some other suggestions made, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| we didn't necessarily concur with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| Those would be the suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| that we would make to this ordinance in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| concurrence with our conversations with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| Ms. Cooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| Just restating that, that is a motion that we will continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| discussion on this. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| Unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| when Mr. Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| sent out his memo this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| he kicked it off, kicked it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| I just got a copy of this like five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| ago from Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| I guess my question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| now that you're making significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| changes that weren't brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| during the public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| and the first reading of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| are we back to the same situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| and we haven't given public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| notice enough to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| able to accept these amendments and vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| Because this has been such a big issue for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| the community here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| At a glance, I would think that if we made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| any remarkable changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| at a glance, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| it's the old red face test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| If you're going to make a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| and if you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| well, it's not a sizable change and your face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| would turn red, then it probably is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| a sizable change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| I want to drill down on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| just a little bit more to see if it meets that standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| Because if it does, then that would set this back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| at least in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| I'll look to Law Director Tood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| if Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| if you'd like to weigh in, Bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| Well, unlike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| MPC and having to go back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| you are the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| and to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| whether or not you have a substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| change, it is up to this body to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| determine whether or not you have a substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| Because you are the body, it's not like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| you're looking, is there going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| a change from somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| So, you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| can discuss that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| and vote whether you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| move it back to first reading if you believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| it's a substantial change or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| But it's up to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| all, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| in this particular case as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| it would go to first reading or second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| Looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| the evidence, I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| two things that changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| One had to do, there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| a lot of recommendations that were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| accepted that did not change the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| overall character of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| ordinance. There were two changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| They had to do with speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| and density of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| and whether you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| would put roads everywhere, I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| sidewalks everywhere or sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| in specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| In the big scheme of things, you'll have to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| whether that's significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| Commissioner Skinmaker, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| I just have a problem with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| going through a public meeting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| having people there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| coming out and testifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| and then we come to the point of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| voting and all of a sudden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| brand new information that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| they haven't been able to see and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| unfortunately I was probably the only commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| that couldn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| I just have a problem with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| the process because this has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| kind of a, I mean there was a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| that came for the public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| obviously it's important to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| Commissioner Smith, you were second on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| Have you spoken on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| yet? Okay, I'll recognize you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| and then I've got a couple of questions and I'm going to circle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| back around. All right, go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Commissioner Smith. Thank you Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| As it pertains to the changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| these are changes made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| from the input they gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| Good point. I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| my question on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| as I was looking through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| actual original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| resolution and it kind of goes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| some of the things we've been talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| tonight as it relates to greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| looking at, as we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| the recommended resolution here, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| there's two things that I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| to I guess put on the floor for just some quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| discussion and or clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| One is when we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| item, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| and you've got A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| two, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| we go from item I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| double I, or one, two, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| three for some clarification around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| distances and the things that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| generating a pedestrian traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| Maybe it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| because of the pure coincidence that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| we're talking about greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| would want to see language in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| that was not ambiguous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| but that language that's very clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| because it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| within one-fourth quarter mile of established pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| facilities, I don't understand a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| or similar uses that would generate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| pedestrian traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| I would want to see it clear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| there's language in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| here if this passes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| that consider greenways or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| planned greenways something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| would be taken into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| if you're wanting to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| front footage on some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| these sidewalks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| It goes back to some stuff that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| Lindsey had said and some stuff we talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| about. Part of what we're trying to do is get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| to connections, but we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| now got some plans and as I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| earlier, we've got those top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| ten plans or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| I can't remember the exact number, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| the folks who put this greenway plan together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| identified the low-hanging fruit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| that could be the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| implementable, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| cheap, but also not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| whole buffet line, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| will, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| it's clear. It's on maps. You've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| the first, and I will say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| you have the recommended path and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| secondary pass, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| if this ordinance were to pass, I'd want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| to have it clear that we consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| or proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| greenways in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| this language, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| isn't that kind of also what everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| is trying to get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| That struck me, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| I guess I'm a little bit hung up on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| the quarter mile, half mile kind of thing, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| just for me personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| Jim and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| your team, I see all non, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| maybe if you're non-Hugh, you're on crack, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| if you're saying this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| it seems to me like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| common sense kind of addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| to this ordinance, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| if y'all could kind of weigh in on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| because I'm inviting y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| up here. Go ahead, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2498)|
| 0:41:46| Go ahead. I'm sorry. Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| I concur. I mean, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| if the Parks and Rec Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| has a planned greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| plan that may not be implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| if it falls through. I mean, Jim, we approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| it tonight. It's right here. Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| I haven't seen it necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| but yes, sir, we would consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| that an existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| facility, even though it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| in the planning stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| I mean, there's lines there. It's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| what's funded and what hasn't been funded. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| I would want to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| that's a consideration. Then back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| quarter mile, half mile debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| on that one. I guess that's still something. I think I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| even brought it up at the last meeting. I just, I would hate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| to see, even if you carved that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| and said, if you had fourth mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| on some library stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| and then a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| mile near a greenway, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| know if I'm trying to make this too hard, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| just kind of, based on some of the reading I've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| on some of these good greenway ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| I would hate to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| passed this plan, then try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| to focus on the low-hanging fruit within it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| and then have something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| where we could get a developer to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| for part of the connector to it, not get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| pushed through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| that's a thought on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| We still have a motion on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| but I may consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| a substitute motion. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| back to our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| appreciate all your work on this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| but I just needed to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| We accepted two of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| recommendations, is that correct, from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| Bike Walk Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| From your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| email that was sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| Proposal number one, and you responded to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| and proposal number two, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| Yes, ma'am. There was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| two, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| I mean, obviously, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| is just an obvious question, but this is posed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| for the public. We responded to the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| concerns and answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| what their outstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| questions were. We did. Obviously, we didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| agree to all of those, but we provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| a rationale of our opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| of that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| All right. Thank you. Back to Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| Chairman. I just would like to say, my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| thoughts are that we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| substantially changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| anything for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| a couple of reasons. One, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| what happened to Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| Skinmaker's email address, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| Jim Snowden sent this out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| everybody here, including everybody in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| and everybody who's talking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| against, and beside it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| at 1127. So everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| had this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| well since the beginning of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| and on top of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| we're taking what was already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| proposed and adding things from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| opposition. So it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| a plus-plus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| not a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| change. So I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| consider that, I mean, you asked the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| body to weigh in on it, so I think the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| at least this part, would like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| we can move on with some amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| All right. Back to you, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So BikeWalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| Knoxville's, they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| agreed to this proposal? Is that what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| I'm understanding, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| This was their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| From their recommendations, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| There are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| the two that he has proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| have been changed a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| from what we recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| but the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| element of this is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| I would like, first of all, let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| back up and just say, just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| that there's been essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| no planning, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| you're very aware of, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| where sidewalks would be most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| beneficial in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| Maybe having the Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| plan will help with guiding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| some of that planning, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| I agree with you completely. We really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| need to work to try to find those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| connections, but up to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| there has been no planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| and there's never been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| I'm sorry, there's been one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| of dedicated funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| There has not been dedicated funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| for sidewalks in the Knox County budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| I know it's never,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| I mean, it's a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| it gets you a whole mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| but, you know, if you don't have any funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| there are not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| to be sidewalks, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| you need to think about it more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| strategically, as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| how are you going to spend those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| precious funds, and try to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| some connectivity. My concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| is even right now, when you ask the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| developers to put that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| 100-foot frontage road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| and there's another subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| not even a quarter of a mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| there's going to be a gap, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| there's going to be another, and another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| and how are you going to connect those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| My concern is that there's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| just fewer sidewalks overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| that connect. At least when they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| in the neighborhood, people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| in the neighborhood can walk safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| And the other concern I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| is that the speed limit of 25 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| per hour is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| not enforced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| and people will drive over that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| and that's where there's the risk of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| getting injured and killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| And as far as the mortality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| rates, I know y'all were listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| baby boomers are doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| Baby boomers are doing well health-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| Let me just add one thing, but middle-aged people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| are dying at younger ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| I was just trying to find out if you agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| with these adjustments. I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| I digress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| It's very personal to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| I agree with these. I wish it had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| the one-half mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| stipulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| in it. Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| Is it too late?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| We had some more people that wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| Well, it's public forum. I mean, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| granted it. But what I might add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| is there was Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| By the way, Commissioner Skinmaker still has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| I do want to recognize Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| Then I'll come back to you, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| as we've been clear on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| allowing people to speak on public forum at this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| Dr. Cooley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| spoke a little bit about planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| You know, if we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| pass this ordinance, we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| even have a reason to plan because we've taken it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| of the hands of our Department of Engineering to even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| determine where they go anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| And all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2888)|

| 0:48:12| all of this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| greenways, sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| facilities, are going to require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| significant investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| from this commission and from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| this mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| But if we are not driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| the train on that, this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| gives us the ability to drive the train| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| and do what we feel like is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| we're comparing the city to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| And that's a huge problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| because we could go and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| you know, Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| here's what we did in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| On Steel Road, a subdivision was built behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| It did not have a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| The subdivision above the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| or above that subdivision, had a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| and the county came back and added that tenth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| of a mile. We did that in 2009 or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| 2010, I think it was 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| and connected that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| That was because we saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| a gap. Kids were walking down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| and created their own dirt trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| But the reality is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| this is a starting point. This is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| the end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| the discussion. I mean, it's not like we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| going to pass this ordinance and close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| everybody out. I think we got this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| like this is the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| nail in the coffin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| This is the beginning point for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| And I agree with Dr. Cooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| There's nothing that she said that I don't agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| But if you're not willing to fund it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| don't vote for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| all of the things that Bike, Walk, Knoxville wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| because it's going to sit there dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| And so, let us get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| to the starting point. This is the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| of the process, not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| end of the process. And I think that's how we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| to view this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| Thank you, Commissioner Anders. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| I agree with everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| you've said, too, about walking, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| important it is to connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| and our ability to be less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| dependent on autos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| But one of the problems we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| is we are trying to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| urban city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| type facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| with a plan that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| designed for rural sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| And until we can address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| these issues, we're going to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| to have these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| But I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| comfortable in, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| Commissioner Anders said, that this is a start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| and this is where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| we need to start. And I feel very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| comfortable with our EPW's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| capabilities and expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| Mr. Smith, I'll grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| you that through Robert's Rules of Order, but I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| acknowledge that we had some folks that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| had said we'd allow to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| You've got the floor, you've made the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| but I do acknowledge that we've got folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| who are ready to speak. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| Commissioner Smith has called the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| to state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| what we are voting on. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| requires a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| Mr. Law Director, it should be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| majority of the Commissioners present. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| I call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| It's a majority of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| membership, not the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| of people here. It takes six votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| to pass anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| All right. So, just for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| of the audience, when a question is called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| that means we need to vote whether we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| going to take a vote right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| on this matter. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| what you're voting on, my fellow Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| is, and it would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| six votes to accept that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| being called, and then upon completion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| of that, move on to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| actually voting on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| If people signed up for public forum, I do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| want to deny them the right to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| The Chair had recognized the gentleman prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| Point of order, can we not repeat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| what we've already heard the last three times that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| we've heard the same discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| from the audience? I mean, I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| we're now all restating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| the same thing. That's your request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| Mr. Anders, but I also do want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| acknowledge, if we've got a member of the public that wants to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| on this, out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| fairness, we've never not allowed someone to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| on it. So, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| you can go ahead and approach. By the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| do you rescind that motion for right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| I rescind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| Sir, you're recognized. I'm Roland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| Shankles, 1443 Halifax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| Road, here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| And I think, from listening as closely as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| could, Commissioner Jay has convinced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| me that for the taxpayers to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| for miles and miles of sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| maybe a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| bridge too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| I mean, it sounds like the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| of connecting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| which would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| that would be the goal of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| most people that want children to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| walk out of their houses and get to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| or for somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| to walk their stroller down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| street to get to a Weigel's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| or to a playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| But for the taxpayers to pay for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| that at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| a million dollars a mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| or whatever it costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| it sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| from the original ordinance that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| and maybe I'm wrong, but it sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| like from the original ordinance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| as much of the cost as we can put on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| to the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| in exchange for allowing them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| build the houses and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| yards and the landscaping that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| do to include the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| it sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| with this ordinance you're saying, here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| take it off the, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| take it out of an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| and put it on to the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| department. Trust us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| we'll make, we'll get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| those sidewalks built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| if you'll allow us to not build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| the sidewalks in the subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| That's pretty much what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| That sounds like what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| And all I would be advocating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| for would be to say, don't give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| up requiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| the developers to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| a quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| because if we wait for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| taxpayers to pay for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| I know new developments bring new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| property tax and that's a wonderful thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| for the county, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| to let the developers off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| the hook in exchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| them building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| more less expensive developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| just seems like a bad tradeoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| To vote against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| sidewalks would be a tough vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| if our roles were reversed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| That you're going from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| a definite ordinance that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| do this if you want to do a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| to, we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| an engineering department that may require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| you to build some frontal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| sidewalks that will connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| And if I'm mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| I'm sorry, I certainly don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| to muddle the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| But the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| requires the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| to pay for sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| And I'm in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| All right. Sir, did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| You're standing, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| Sir, wait, I'm going to actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| I believe you spoke last week, and I don't believe this gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| spoke on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| Go ahead. You're recognized. Approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| State your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3328)|

| 0:55:34| Dozer Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| I just had a couple quick notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| One, I think there's been some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| possible misinformation or misunderstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| going on. I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| that this ordinance at all says no to sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| It's not for sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| or against sidewalks. This allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| engineering some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| flexibility. This is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| taking money, saying developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| are free. You don't get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| save money. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| when it's better for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| to build something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| sidewalk it elsewhere or do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| This is not a cost savings feature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| This just gives flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| Talking about bikes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| on sidewalks, that's not allowed in the county, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| So there's just been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| some misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| You know, this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| sidewalks aren't always the best solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| As Mr. Snowden says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| they're very expensive to upkeep. That's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| that wasn't discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| the ADA requirements and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| That's something that's the county dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| for eternity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| I'm for the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| Could you repeat that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| What did you say about bikes in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| Bikes are supposed to be on the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| and not on sidewalks in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| In the city, I think there's something where it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| allow them, but not in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| If you drive around in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| Farragut, by the Dollar General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| or anything, you see bikers slowing down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| because they're on the roads and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| sidewalks even when there's sidewalks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| All right, I do want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| see if this board would consider a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| which would be to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| add specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| that considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| greenways or planned greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| in part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| two, I guess, or double I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| here, that would be something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| within one quarter mile of public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| facilities such as libraries, parks, and senior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| sitters, I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| make a motion for a friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| amendment to this to see if we could at least get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| into language that proposed greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| are considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| within that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| quarter mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| area, just to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| Jim, is a greenway considered a pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| facility just like a sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| I don't know what the true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| definition for an engineering firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| It was our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| If the chair wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| clarify that, but certainly what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| Chairman Nystrom is saying, it was our intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| whether it be sidewalk, greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| multi-use path, whatever that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| pedestrian generator was, we consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| it the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| The language to add to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| would be to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| I guess after the semicolon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| or actually the semicolon would come at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| end, there would be a comma after senior centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| and then the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| greenways or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| proposed greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| per the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| Greenway Corridor Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| Is that amendment acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| And as the maker of the motion, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| I don't know if we need to vote on that specifically, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| we can just add that to the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| Go ahead, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| I'm sorry because, see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| by inserting greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| into this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| which is not a part of the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| ordinance, and tying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| the infrastructure and cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| to those greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| then changes the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| It changes the intent of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| Go back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| I guess, Commissioner Gill, so is your point being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| if we add that language, this needs to go back to first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3564)|
| 0:59:30| It's a pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| Commissioner Baylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| Are pedestrian facilities in the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| ordinance that was passed on first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| Yes, sir, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| Do those include greenways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| In our eyes, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| I just want to make sure that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| specific and clear that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| consider greenways, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| frankly, you had said before this came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| before us that you hadn't even had a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| to see these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| And I do want to make sure that these plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| are part of the consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| And about the only way to guarantee that is to put it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| So that's kind of where I'm coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| by proposing this addition on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| Unsuspending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| So, Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| is back to calling the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| Little known page in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| Robert's Rules of Order is unsuspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| Commissioner Smith has been recognized for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| calling the question, and that was seconded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| I don't even see the invoice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| We are now voting on whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| we will have the vote after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| So, all in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| Do we need to have a roll call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| vote on this, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| Yeah, I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| All in favor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| calling the question, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3674)|

| 1:01:18| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| Okay, the question before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| excuse me, sorry, I'm starting to lose my voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| a little bit. We're back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| the question as proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| with the additional language that I included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| around the greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| And that is on second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| that needs to be done by a roll call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| vote. Where are we, Madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| All right, we're at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| Commissioner Schoonmaker. Does she need to restate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| the whole motion again so everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| is on first base since this has gotten a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| little convoluted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| All right, what was that? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| Please say that to your microphone there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3726)|

| 1:02:18| agreed to, did he present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| a printed copy to the clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| of the added things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| I'll make sure she's got it on me. I've got my email to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3746)|

| 1:02:32| residential subdivision roads with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3752)|

| 1:02:36| of 25 miles an hour or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| greater, sidewalks are to be put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| Also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| in subdivision roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| where the speed limit is 25 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| an hour or less, and there are more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| a thousand day trips also to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3772)|

| 1:02:56| road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| And then the chairman's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| amendment. You stated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| I stated it clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| earlier, which was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| add after that last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| comma in item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| II| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| to clarify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| current greenways and proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| greenways in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| Greenway Corridor Study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| be considered when measuring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| the yardage from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| Jim, did I properly state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| And I may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| misheard you, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| Smith, but in regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| the location where there are a thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| vehicle trips or greater a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| we would only require those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| when the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| was within the PRZ or a quarter mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| That was one thing I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| you mentioned. I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| I had it written down here, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| Okay. I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| been clear. Everybody knows what they're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| All right. Go ahead. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| sorry, Commissioner Gill. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| So I just need to make sure the ordinance...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| And I just need to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| we are agreeing upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| the ordinance that is written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| in our agenda is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| Plus we're adding the speed limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| is higher than 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| miles per hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| greater than a thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| vehicle trips per day. No sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| are required on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| Because this is what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| in the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| What do you got there, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| It says sidewalks are on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| one side of the street. I don't think it clarified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| website. That's on the 25-mile-an-hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| Okay. Are we reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| your response to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| BikeWalk Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| Yes, ma'am. That would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| That's what I wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| Because in his email, under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| his response to proposal number one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| is what we need to have in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| I just needed to make sure that was correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| because that language is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| correct. And then his second recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| from what is written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| in this email needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| to be in the ordinance and adding your word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| Greenway. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| Yes. Because I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| need to make sure that's what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3920)|
| 1:05:34| Are you getting ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| I'm going to pass for just a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| because I'm reading one other caption here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| real quickly. So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| All right. Mr. Skinmaker has indicated he wants to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| On the roll call vote, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| saying you're passing? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| I'll give you an answer in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| Do you need an extra second? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| It doesn't start with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| anyway. It starts over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| All right. Where does it start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| I'm not sure where you left it, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| With Anders. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3970)|

| 1:06:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| I'll vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| Commissioner Nystrom votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| Commissioner Skinmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4006)|
| 1:07:00| We've been here too long, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| Um.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| You do know they're not etching these in stone, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| No, I know, but it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| Commissioner Schoonmaker votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2, and 3, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4034)|
| 1:07:20| Does anyone wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| 6, 2, and 3, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| All right, we're 6, 2, 3, noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| As part of a veiling side, I'd like to bring this back up to see if we could consider changing the distance to half a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4047)|
| 1:07:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| I just want to give this due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| So is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| I'll make a motion as part of the prevailing side to bring this back up so we can consider the half mile distance which is in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4066)|
| 1:07:54| If it should pass, then that would set it back to day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4074)|
| 1:08:00| So that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| 6, 2 didn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| It passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| It passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| It did pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| We have a passed resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| It passed 6, 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| I voted with the prevailing side, and as a member of the prevailing side, I can bring this back up for consideration because we have not closed the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4094)|
| 1:08:25| So I am bringing this back up in the form of a motion for reconsideration and to finally consider if we would, I know it's been long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4105)|
| 1:08:35| forgive me, if we as a body would consider changing it from one-fourth to one-half a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4115)|
| 1:08:43| That is, for that to pass, that would require a vote of 6, I believe, clarifying from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4123)|
| 1:08:52| Would it be 6 or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| 7 to bring it back up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| I think you have to have more than just a simple majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| 8 to bring it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| I mean, 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| Don't all ordinances have to pass by two-thirds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| I'd like to get my motion on the floor is to bring this back up for reconsideration for changing it from a quarter to a half mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4154)|
| 1:09:23| That is my motion on the floor to bring it back up for additional consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| I've got a second from Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| So for that, which would probably, if that should pass, that would be a sizable change and set this back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4172)|
| 1:09:38| but it would probably require how many votes for that change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| Would that require 8 votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| It has to be a vote to bring it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| Just a point of order, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| Sorry, yeah, I'm trying to get a point of clarification from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| Over there, Commissioner Jay has my copy of the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| I also want to go back to you, Commissioner Baylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| But having done this last meeting, I believe there has to be a vote to bring it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4202)|
| 1:10:08| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| It requires the two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| That's the first vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| So is it two-thirds to bring it back up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| Bring it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| Two-thirds of the body, not two-thirds of what's present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| Two-thirds of membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| Two-thirds of membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart2?start=4219)|
