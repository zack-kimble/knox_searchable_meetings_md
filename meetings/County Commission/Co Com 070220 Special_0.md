| 0:00:12| Knox County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=12)|
| 0:00:15| Live coverage of these regular meetings can be seen monthly on CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=15)|
| 0:00:30| We have 18 members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=30)|
| 0:00:32| Before we get started, I just want to make it clear to the Mayor, we've started just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=32)|
| 0:00:38| a little bit late, but as always, we will extend any time that you need or you feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=38)|
| 0:00:43| that we need to do, and we'll have our regular committee meetings following our second special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=43)|
| 0:00:50| call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=50)|
| 0:00:51| So, Clerk, item number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=51)|
| 0:00:55| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee appointing members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=55)|
| 0:00:58| to the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=58)|
| 0:01:02| County Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=62)|
| 0:01:06| Chairman Moore and Commissioners, good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=66)|
| 0:01:08| I requested this meeting for two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=68)|
| 0:01:10| The Ethics Committee is the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=70)|
| 0:01:16| Last month, the County Commission unanimously approved the creation of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=76)|
| 0:01:21| It was sponsored by Chairman Moore and Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=81)|
| 0:01:26| I'm grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| Today, I'm presenting five names to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=88)|
| 0:01:30| I think that it's appropriate that I present them to you individually for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=90)|
| 0:01:35| I would like to begin with Commissioner Phil Ballard, and then in alphabetical order, follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=95)|
| 0:01:39| through to Commissioner Mike Hammond, Commissioner Mark Harmon, Ms. Martha Phillips, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=99)|
| 0:01:45| Commissioner R. Larry Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| I had many good options that I could present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| I think, however, these five public officials will do a good job in serving their one-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=109)|
| 0:01:54| term on the Knox County Ethics Committee, and today, I present them for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=114)|
| 0:01:59| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| Seconded by Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=121)|
| 0:02:06| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to see a split question and vote on each person individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| Do we need a vote on that, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=135)|
| 0:02:20| Unless there's any objection, you can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=140)|
| 0:02:25| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| Can we amend this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| Can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| We've got an ethics committee set up of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=150)|
| 0:02:34| Is there any way to amend this to allow the public to serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| Maybe one person from each district, instead of having people on this body setting in judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=156)|
| 0:02:42| of something that their peers may have done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| I think the public would be better served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| If we had one person from each district, a nine-person panel, can we amend this to Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=170)|
| 0:02:59| John and Mr. Law Director, to see if . . . I talked to a lawyer at CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| He didn't work on this, but he told me that it would be fine if we wanted to amend this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| and send it with one person from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| It would be up to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| I think it would be better served to let the public have some input after what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| I mean, there's a lot of people that don't have a lot of faith in this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| And I think that's one way to start putting something back out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| There's a couple of answers to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| First of all, can you amend it today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| And the answer, my answer to that would be no, because this special call meeting has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| a certain purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| And that purpose is to confirm or to vote on these recommendations made by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=218)|
| 0:03:48| Secondly, can you amend the ethics policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| CTAS . . . Knox County Commission adopted the model policy of CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=234)|
| 0:04:02| CTAS will tell you that there is no requirement, first of all, that you have an ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=242)|
| 0:04:12| And there is no groundwork laid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| There's no guidance on the makeup of that committee or how it is to be adopted and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| This is CTAS's version of what they've tried to come up with something that would be universal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=264)|
| 0:04:32| that would apply in all 95 counties, that all 95 counties could adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=272)|
| 0:04:39| The act that was passed by the legislature last year does not require that there be an ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=279)|
| 0:04:48| However, the CTAS policy does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| And they did that because they wanted some way to handle the ethics complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| I have communicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| I haven't received a response back yet from the Tennessee Ethics Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| I've communicated with them and asked them a number of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| and hopefully they will respond to me today or tomorrow so I'll have better information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| But I'm really unsure of the Tennessee Ethics Commission's role in all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| I mean, do they have the authority to approve or reject a policy that is passed by a legislative body or a municipality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=320)|
| 0:05:32| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| I don't see that in the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| And so I have a number of questions I have asked them to clarify for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=335)|
| 0:05:43| One of those questions is, what about the makeup of a committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| Would they reject an ethics policy that contains a different makeup or a different approval mechanism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=347)|
| 0:05:56| I've asked that question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| And hopefully I will get a response in the next, like I say, this afternoon or tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| Well, the conversation I had with Steve Austin at CTAS, and he didn't work on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| but he's a lawyer down there and I work with him closely at Tennessee Sheriff's Association and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| And he said this was just a model for us to go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| It's parameters that are set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| But we can certainly amend it any way we wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| And I'd like to look at that somehow, if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| My comments are somewhat along the same line that's been brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| Reading what was passed last month, it looks like the only role, the model one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=396)|
| 0:06:43| is for the ethics committee is to consider complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| That's the end of the duty there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| If we want to do some of the things that Mayor Ragsdale has indicated, and I think those are good ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=410)|
| 0:06:57| either we have maybe two approaches, and that's where the law department come in to, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| to research whether we can amend this model act to accomplish these tasks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=422)|
| 0:07:08| or to set one up locally but use maybe the same people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| Those are different approaches, but it's at the same end to enlarge the function of what this act that was adopted states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=433)|
| 0:07:23| because it's a more limited role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| And what's been addressed here is a more incomprehensible role, a larger role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| And to do that, I think either we have to have our own that we set up by resolution or ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| or if we can amend under this act a larger role, those are two approaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| So I'd like to request the law department look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| and advise us along with the mayor as to how we ought to proceed to accomplish this end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=465)|
| 0:07:57| Okay. Do we have any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| You know, I think Commissioner Trammell has a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| According to the law director, I don't think we can do it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| Mr. Mayor, I guess if we could put this on to our regular agenda for Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| and have some answers back from the Attorney General, from somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| From the Ethics Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| From the Ethics Commission about how to make this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| And maybe if citizens can serve, the way I heard Commissioner Trammell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| maybe elect or appoint one person from each county commission district to sit on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| I think that gets the citizens back involved in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| I would like for you to go ahead and vote on those five nominees today so we can have something in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| If you want to amend it down the road, that's certainly your prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| I think after Mr. Owens checks, he'll find out that any amendments must be approved by the Ethics Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| And I also think we do have to have something in place by July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| So we call this special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| I've got my nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| I'd like for you to act on them up or down if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| Okay. Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Question for the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| If we appoint these today, what is their term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| How long is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| Is it one year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| So would that mean that we could not amend this for a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| So what we need to do is if we want to go along with Mr. Trammell's, Commissioner Trammell's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=562)|
| 0:09:31| As far as the makeup of this body, I think you would probably not be able to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=571)|
| 0:09:39| You could add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| I don't think that you could affect the terms of the five persons who are appointed today by an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=581)|
| 0:09:49| You can always amend the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| And I'm uncertain, Mayor, whether the Tennessee Ethics Commission will ultimately, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=592)|
| 0:10:00| part of their duties is to approve of a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| I know that one has to be filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| And there really aren't ñ there isn't a lot of guidance in the act that was passed last year on what should be contained in the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=607)|
| 0:10:18| But I do see TASA's effort to try to comply with the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| And they enhanced it by creating an ethics committee to deal with complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=624)|
| 0:10:31| See, I don't know if even if you have an ethics committee, for instance, in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=631)|
| 0:10:38| could complaints also be filed with the Tennessee Ethics Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| Can you bypass this committee and go to the Ethics Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| If you don't have an ethics, a local ethics committee, are complaints filed with the Tennessee Ethics Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=646)|
| 0:10:53| I don't know the answer to those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| It's not in the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| If you wanted to amend this later to add others in addition to the five, I think that would be a fine idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| You could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| Go ahead and have that in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| I'd like to make a substitute motion if it's appropriate to defer this until our regular commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| because I believe strongly that we ought to look at having citizens on this board and not politicians watching politicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=672)|
| 0:11:19| It's kind of like the fox guard and the hen house, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| But it's only my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| So do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| Discussion of the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| I'll second that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| I'd like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Commissioner Pinkston has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| You know, we've been criticized for not having public input into what we've been doing up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| This is the best example that I can see that we could have public input in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| I don't think a commissioner out of any district should be allowed to even serve on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| Not only has my integrity been questioned, but every commissioner on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| So we should not have any kind of cover-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| So let's go straight to the citizens of this and let them decide whether we do things wrong unethically or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=722)|
| 0:12:09| And I think that's giving public input, which the public wants right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| Commissioner Ivan-Horman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| I guess this question is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| Just who are we covering under this ethics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| Just the commission, the mayor's office, trustee, who's all under this ethics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| Everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| State, supreme, everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| As far as Knox County, it's the mayor and his employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| It's me and my employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| It is every member of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| It is every member of any governmental body, any board, any committee that basically touches upon Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=757)|
| 0:12:45| It is all of our employees that are covered by this policy as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| And currently members of the MPC as well as the utility districts and other appointed bodies are also covered under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| Well, I think it's important that we do get the public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| And I agree with Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| We need to put this off until next month or next meeting so we can get this thing straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| I agree with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| We don't need the fox guard in the hen house, so to speak, in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| Commissioner Mark-Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| This sudden concern for citizen input is welcome but belated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=793)|
| 0:13:23| There was this concern about the membership when we were actually debating the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| We have a resolution here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| We have something that we have passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| We need to get it done by the middle of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| If we want to add representatives, fine, but let's remember what the purpose of this body is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| It is a body for the citizens themselves to come forward and to raise complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| So if you delay it, you're delaying the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| We can add them later, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| But let us move on with the business along the lines of what we have already passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| And as mentioned, it covers everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| And if there's anxiety about investigating some other aspect of county government in addition to ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| such as the mayor's office, let us remember that the mayor at his press conference announcing this said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| start with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| So if you're anxious to look into that office, start with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| Start with the rest of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| Let's get the job done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| Mr. Chairman, a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| The school board, law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| Is covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| And school employees too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Let me just make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| If we defer this, we're deferring it six days, not some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| Right, to a regular commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Because I think we need some answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| And one of the answers I'd like to see is it says in there a reasonable person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| I mean, if you see me out eating lunch with somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| is somebody going to jerk me up here before this ethics panel and say that someone bought me lunch when they may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| or may not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| But I think we also need some guidelines on what the amount's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| Is it a $5 lunch or is it no lunch or is it a $50 lunch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| You know, I think we need those answers on the front end, not on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| So, you know, there are some questions, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| I'd like us to work out on the front end as well because I don't mind to go by the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| but I need to know what the law is so I can go by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| Well, CTAS will tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| And, by the way, I believe they are going to be coming to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=916)|
| 0:15:24| They're trying to come in mid-March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| So it might be a good thing for everyone to attend and to discuss the ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=927)|
| 0:15:34| But they will tell you that this policy by no means means that you can't have lunch with a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=934)|
| 0:15:42| and that a person can't buy an employee or an official lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| Although the CTAS will say, I say, well, how much of a lunch are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=948)|
| 0:15:56| Are you talking about, you know, the Sonic or are you talking about Regus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| And they came up with the figure $20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| And I don't know where you come up with $20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| So it's what a reasonable person would believe that might influence a person's judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=967)|
| 0:16:20| And in the judgment of CTAS, that was $20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| I don't know why it's not $10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| I don't know why it's not $30 or $50 or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| Commissioner Hanlon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| When Mayor Ragsdale came to me and asked if I would serve on this commission, I was reluctant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| My first reaction was, why do I want to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| Because anybody who agrees to do this has a huge bull's eye on their back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| because we're going to be judged not only by the members of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| we're going to be judged by the public at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| I'm not really looking for anything else to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| I have plenty on my plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| I will serve at the pleasure of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| If the body chooses not to have any commissioners, that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| But I do want to address this fox-in-the-henhouse statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| in that anything that we do must come back before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| If we recommend any action, any ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| you will have the opportunity to scrutinize it and to vote it up or vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| The other thing is, as I mentioned before, the members of this commission have a huge bull's eye on our back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| We will be judged and judged very harshly and very critically by the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| if we fail to take action on any ethics complaints or if we do take action on ethics complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| And so there is a lot to consider with regards to being on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1053)|
| 0:17:40| But once again, I serve at the pleasure of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| and if you folks decide that you want to move in another direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| I am perfectly willing to go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| Thank you, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| Let me say one thing to the law director, a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| I've heard on TV and some of the talk shows, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| a nepotism policy and different policies coming out of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| And I don't see that in their authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| So, Mr. Law Director, can you explain to me how they can create policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| if they don't have the authority to create them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| As it stands right now, I do not read from our policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| or from the legislation that was passed last year in our legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| where this committee has any authority to develop policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| It could be said that while they're investigating a complaint, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| that they could bootstrap an argument into, well, this employee committed a certain error,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1115)|
| 0:18:44| and you know what, a nepotism policy would have cured that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| You know, perhaps they could come through with a recommendation of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| But you will not find that authority in this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| As it stands now, they are purely an investigative and recommending body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1137)|
| 0:19:08| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| We've obviously heard from legal counsel that we don't have all the information we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| Mr. Mayor, does six days give you that much heartburn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| Six days doesn't give me heartburn, but we approve this unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| It's interesting that it was fine less than 30 days ago that the chairman sponsored it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| Mr. Harmon, you sponsored it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| Now you'd rather have your own appointees, I assume, on the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| Certainly you're prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| I'm excited about the newfound spirit of citizen involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| I think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| But I would hope that, again, we presented this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| If you wanted to add to that group, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| But you've got five good nominees in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| This is the policy that CTASC and their attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| I did talk to the CTASC attorney who drafted this, David Connor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| It's the way he envisioned it working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| The state has said if you approve this policy, it does not require their review because they believe in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| And as a result, I think it's a good way of moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| We call that meeting to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| And as it relates to nepotism, if you wouldn't like this group to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| I'll be more than delighted to have several policies for you to consider on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| if you'd like to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| Several counties across Tennessee have already found things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| My goal was to let the ethics committee look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| but I'll be glad to go ahead and pass along those resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| Let me address one thing that the mayor did say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| He said we passed this unanimously at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| We passed it on a consent calendar that we didn't have any discussion about it, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| And we were talking about term limited commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| and we were working on that issue and this issue ended up on a consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| I think you sure did spend a lot of time talking about the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| so I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| There's nothing, Mr. Mayor, I want you to understand my amendment to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| there was nothing wrong with Mr. Hammond, Mr. Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| any of the commissioners you picked, you know, fine choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| I just really believe that with everything that's happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| and what we've been through that it's going to be a lot better to have public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| to have the public sit on this panel in judgment of us and what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1278)|
| 0:21:27| Short of an election, you know, and I don't see any way we're going to have an election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| this is a way to get the public back involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| The policy of this model here is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| It's a model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| And we can amend it if you want to bring other things forward next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| but I don't think six days is going to hurt us a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| I wish you'd get on board with this because I think this is what the public needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| to try to restore some of the trust that you feel has been lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| Commissioner Trammell, that's a fair assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| In a second I'm going to bring up the topic of an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| I hope that same spirit will continue because we do think you can have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| That's why I have Senator Gilbert with me today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1322)|
| 0:22:09| a former member of the General Assembly, an attorney who's advising both me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| and Senator Burchett on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| And as you get to the second item, I hope that same spirit continues over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| I would just add that the law director's answer about the fact that we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| if this committee is set up as planned and currently laid out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| that commissioners can take from this, from these experiences brought to them by the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| very good ideas for items that should be brought to the entire commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| And that speaks to the advantage of having commissioners on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| And if you get one from every district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| probably we will follow past practice and defer to the judgment of the commissioner in that district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| and pretty soon it will look like every other board and every other action we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| So why not follow the CTAS policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| I mean, are we really saying that we don't look at the items on the consent agenda sufficiently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| to know what's in them and to skirt over disapproval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| We pass this and we should follow through with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| Thank you, Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| Mr. Chairman, what you all are proposing here is who would make these appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| Would the mayor's office do that or, Mr. Chairman, do you make those appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| No, I think what Mr. Trammell, I'll let him speak to what his motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| What do you think, Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| I think each district has an appointment of one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| It would be made up of a nine-member panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| I think that's an excellent way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| Each commission district would be represented by someone in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| and those persons would be chosen by the people that represent that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1420)|
| 0:23:46| And ratified by the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| And ratified by the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1427)|
| 0:23:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| So we're on, Commissioner Trammell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| This body did, you know, you voted on this ethics commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| but you know there was eight of us that weren't on this body when this ethics policy was voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| So in all fairness to the eight new ones, let us have an opportunity to do something right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| The substitute motion on the floor is to defer it until regular commission day six days from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1465)|
| 0:24:34| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| All in favor of that say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| We'll start roll call starting in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| Commissioner Jordan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1488)|

| 0:25:51| Commissioner Jordan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1552)|
| 0:26:02| We had 11 yeses, 8 noes, so the motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| Okay, clerk, we're on item number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| Now, let me get correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| We're going to have some information from our law director next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| We'll have a full commission on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| requesting the State Legislature to authorize a special election in 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| for the recently appointed 12 Knox County officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| In your newfound sense of public cooperation and public involvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| I hope that you can see fit to support this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| When meeting with the governor and the lieutenant governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| they made it very clear to me initially that they thought an election would be better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| and they thought it would be better sooner rather than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| In dealing with the governor's legal counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| he questioned whether it could be a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| The past week we've worked with Senator Burchett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| and former Senator Gilbert has been advising both me and Senator Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| We've requested an attorney general's opinion on can you move the election forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| to coincide perhaps with the city election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| And at this time I'd like to call on Senator Gilbert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| to explain a little bit about the work he's doing and what lies before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1638)|
| 0:27:26| Thank you, Mayor Ragsdale, and good morning to the members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| and let me thank each of you for what you do for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| I know you make a lot of personal sacrifices in your role as public servants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| and having been there for eight years, I certainly appreciate what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| First of all, let me clarify what my role is in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| I've had several questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| Lawyers are encouraged to provide pro bono services, and that is what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| I have been a longtime personal attorney for the Ragsdale family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| and also for Senator Tim Burchett, and in my capacity as their personal attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| I have volunteered on a pro bono basis to give them advice from time to time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| on matters that may be of interest to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| and that is why I've been called in on this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| The question that was asked of the governor and his staff recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| that resulted in a February 8th letter, which I believe that most of you are familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| unfortunately did not frame the question correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| If you'll read that letter carefully, you'll see in the first paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| that they were responding to the question of whether a special election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| could be held to replace vacancies in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| The answer to that is clearly no, and the reason for that is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| the Constitution of the state of Tennessee in Article II, Section 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| makes it clear that you folks have the power to appoint vacancy replacements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| That's in the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| No one can change that except through a constitutional amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| and obviously there is not enough time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| The question, though, should be framed as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| If you read Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| it says the county commission has the power to replace those vacancies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| and those appointments shall hold office until the next election, and that is the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1747)|
| 0:29:14| What does the phrase the next election mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| In 1980, a Supreme Court decision in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| McPherson v. Everett, was decided that dealt with that very question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| In fact, it dealt with an elected official over in Davidson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| who was appointed by the metropolitan government of Davidson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| when a county official died in office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| and that county tried to have a special election sooner than the next general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| and the question was brought up to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| And the court very clearly stated in the 1980 opinion that the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| has the power to determine when the next election occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| And until they do so, in all likelihood, the next election is the next general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| which most of us are familiar with would be the 2008 election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| But that decision, authored by Justice Henry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| very clearly states that the legislature has the power to act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| and when they act they can define the next election under Article II, Section 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| to be whatever they declare it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| And it is under that limited window of opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| that Mayor Ragsdale and Senator Burchett are asking for direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| Of course, wisely so, I think they put that question back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| As the county legislative body, it's appropriate that you signify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| whether you would be interested in having that tool, if you will, in the toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| We believe, and I certainly believe, and that is the opinion request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| that Senator Burchett has authored dated February the 14th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| which has been submitted to the Attorney General's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| We do not have the answer yet, but it is correctly framed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| and we believe when the AG answers that opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| that it will say that indeed the legislature can define when the next election is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| for purposes of the terms that some of the eight of you would serve until.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| Now that leads to a secondary question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| and then I'll be quiet and let you ask questions, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| And that is, could the legislature, if it act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| do so in a manner that is retroactive to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| the eight of you that were recently appointed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| We are not sure what the answer to that question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| but let me suggest three things to you on why it might be important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| to go ahead and ask the legislature to give you this tool in the toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| First of all, as you're aware of, there are two pending lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| that involve the appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| We don't know what the answer will be to those lawsuits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| but there is a serious possibility that the answer will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| that the appointments are voided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| If so, that law, if it's passed, would not be a retroactive application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| It would be in the toolbox for you to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| in which you could tell the public of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| that they could replace these appointed appointments sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1920)|
| 0:32:07| There is also a possibility that the AG will say that they may retroactively apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| In 1996, the legislature eliminated the Public Service Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| You may remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| There were three elected Public Service Commissioners at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| We abridged or shortened their terms by act of the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| and the courts and the Attorney General ruled that that was legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| So we're not sure what the answer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| The third answer to that is some of you might choose to fall under that new law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| even though the AG may say that it couldn't be applied retroactively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| How would you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| You could voluntarily resign and be reappointed and under the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| So there are several opportunities for us to come under the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| if it indeed may be passed legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| That's why Senator Burchett and Mayor Ragsdale feel that it is a worthwhile effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| That's why they bring it to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| I'll stop now at this point and try to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| And let me say I have great respect for your attorney, Mr. Owings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| and for the State Attorney General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| They're experts in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| I certainly defer to their good judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| and would be glad to work with them on trying to work through any of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| which is a complicated situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| Do we have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Vice Chairman Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| Attorney Gilbert, I don't usually say much on this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| but everything that you said sounded good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| But in my opinion, the AG is what got us in this problem anyway, his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2014)|
| 0:33:41| You brought us a lot of information, and I really need to think about it totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| Because it was his opinion that said that term limits didn't apply to county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| So now I just need to do a lot of thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| I appreciate that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| In fact, as you may know, I'm the one who asked for that Attorney General's opinion in 1995.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| And we do have a different Attorney General today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| It's Bob Cooper, who's newly appointed, a very smart attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| You know, I read that opinion also in 1995.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| I was a sponsor of many term limit measures and believe in them quite thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| But at the time, I read the opinion and thought it was a pretty well-written opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| But I have to admit, the Supreme Court has the final say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| Opinions are opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| Attorneys will disagree sometimes on what the answers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Let me say a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| First, Mr. Gilbert, you addressed our county attorney is our attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| He's not our attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| He's everybody's attorney in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| He represents the people of this county and legal affairs of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| Secondly, one of the issues is in the Supreme Court, do you agree or disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2084)|
| 0:34:51| the Supreme Court gave us guidelines on how to replace the term limited office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| It did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| By state statute of this body making the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| Do you agree or disagree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| Well, I don't think that was the only remedies available, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| Well, it wasn't the only remedy maybe, but what did the Supreme Court tell us to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| It recognized that Article 2, Section 2 of the Constitution gives you the authority to replace vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2113)|
| 0:35:20| No one disputes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| And the mayor does not either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| So we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| If they would have thought that we could have went to the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| or probably the Supreme Court by their self could have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| hey, Knox County, you're going to have a special election in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| You think they could have done that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| No, the Supreme Court would never do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| The Supreme Court doesn't mandate those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| It applies the law of the land as it exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| But that doesn't mean you have the right as citizens of Knox County and Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| to ask your legislative delegation to pass any law that you think is beneficial to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| We do that every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| You pass resolutions all the time asking your legislature to pass bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| So if this body thinks it's important for the people to regain their trust in their government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| and to have an election sooner than later and it's legally possible to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| the question is are you for it or against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2170)|
| 0:36:19| I think I would be for whatever the law requires us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| If you go back and look at history, you know, the Supreme Court, I believe, years ago used to be elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2183)|
| 0:36:31| Now they're appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Some of the appellate courts, I think they're appointed now by the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2193)|
| 0:36:40| Yes, sir, but I'm not sure what this has to do with the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| Well, what I'm saying is the people's rights were taken away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| and I don't see Governor Bredesen or Governor Sundquist or anybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| when we have an appointment to an appellate court or the Supreme Court come here in Knox County and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| guys, what do you want me to do up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| And I don't believe they're probably quite as fair as Republican Democrats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| that we've been by working with this body and this government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| and totally trying to put back into places the Democrat-Republicans to each office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| I think we did the best we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| Now, in my mind, we had a couple of chances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| We talked about this back a couple months ago when we talked about that commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| Phil Gouda and other commissioners talked about having a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| I believe there's probably nobody on this body that wouldn't have wanted to have a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| Sure would have took us out of the way, and we wouldn't have had all the conflicts that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2251)|
| 0:37:37| So where were you during that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| and how come you didn't ask the attorney general at that point to come in and help us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| Commissioner, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Only state senators and state reps can ask for attorney general opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| I think you know that, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| I know that, but the question is, why didn't you come to this body and say, hey, guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| I think we've got something we can work with here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| I don't represent this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| I represent Mayor Ragsdale and Senator Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| but if you'd like to hire me on a pro bono basis, I'd be glad to talk to you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| Well, and I'll say one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| I don't think that this body has to approve or not approve anything for the legislature to proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| and we've seen that in years past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| The 9-1-1 board appointments taken from this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| and other issues taken away from this body through legislative action that we didn't send them two-thirds majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| So, Commissioner Pinkston, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| Bud, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Did I understand you right in 1980 they called for a special election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| They didn't call for a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| You're talking about in the Nashville case, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| How that arose, as I understand the facts, the fellow that died in office, the Metropolitan-Davidson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2324)|
| 0:38:51| they replaced and then they asked for that fellow to be his vacancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2331)|
| 0:38:58| his term to be extended until the next election, which happened to be a presidential primary in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| The gentleman thought that he should be elected in the regular August county elections, and that set up the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2344)|
| 0:39:11| The court ruled that it was acceptable to go ahead and have the election in the presidential primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| And I can read the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| I believe that's what the Constitution of the State of Tennessee says also, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| Well, no, not exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| The opinion is a very short opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| It's only three pages long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| I'd be glad to get you a-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| Going back to it, had they already made that appointment in Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| Yes, they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| They had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| You know, I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| Right now we do not have any vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| And according to the Supreme Court's ruling on Section 2, Article 7 there, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| Vacancies in county offices shall be filled by the county legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| and any person so appointed shall serve until his successor is elected at the next election occurring after the vacancy and is qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2389)|
| 0:39:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Now, the Constitution goes to state that that's a third Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| I mean, Thursday in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| Well, what I'm saying is what we're really trying to do right now is start impeachment proceedings against these eight people that we've got in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2405)|
| 0:40:13| Is that not correct, what this is leading to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| Well, we're trying to throw them out of office before the Constitution and everything says we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2416)|
| 0:40:23| Well, actually-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| I think that would be impeachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| Maybe I'm wrong, but we've got a Constitution here that we're supposed to live by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| What does it say, Bud, on the elections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| It says until the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| You're misreading the Constitution, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| When does it determine when the next election is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| Does it not say the county general primary in August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| Would you like me to answer, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| Let me read from the 1980 opinion, which very succinctly answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| This is from the third page of the opinion, the next to last paragraph in the opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| It says, we conclude, until such time as the legislature speaks affirmatively and with specificity upon the subject, the phrase next election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2456)|
| 0:41:07| when considered in context of Article 7, Section 5 of the Constitution, voicing the constitutional imperative that elections of judicial and civil officers be elected on the first Thursday in August forever thereafter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2467)|
| 0:41:19| and when considered in the light of almost two centuries of custom, tradition, habit, and practice, must be held to mean the regular August general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2479)|
| 0:41:27| We recognize, however, the right of the legislature to act under Article 7, Section 5, but only in a manner consistent with that article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2487)|
| 0:41:37| The opinion makes clear the legislature can define what the next election is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| That's what Mayor Ragsdale is asking the Commission to endorse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| If the Commission is not interested in having this tool in the toolbox, then they should vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| But if the Commission is interested in allowing the public to speak earlier than later, they should vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2510)|
| 0:41:58| Well, now, in this ruling here, it says consequently that you'll have to pardon me, I've got a cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| The Knox County Election Commission, the election commissioner, cannot conduct a special election to fill these county vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2523)|
| 0:42:11| Rather, the election commission shall place these county offices on the regular August 7, 2008 ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2531)|
| 0:42:18| If the county primary board so chooses, either or both may timely call for a primary for any or all of these offices to be held with the February presidential primary or in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2538)|
| 0:42:31| All right, now, I want to ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| On this special election, when is it to be held?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| Well, that would depend on what the legislation says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| We've asked for two opinions from the AG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| One is the idea of having legislation that says the next election will be the earlier of the next general election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2561)|
| 0:42:48| or an election date set by the county commission of the county affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| Or another option is to have it on the next municipal election of the largest municipality in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| Those are two possibilities, but really it can be whatever the legislation says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| Well, if we don't piggyback with the city, we're going to have to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| Knox County is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Now, according to Greg McKay here, he said it was going to run about $250,000 for a primary and $250,000 for the general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2590)|
| 0:43:19| So we're talking about a half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| Right now we're strapped for tax money, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| I may be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| We've been spending it unwisely, and we've got a lot of things facing us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| But if we don't piggyback, it's going to cost us $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| All right, if we do piggyback it, we're still going to have to pay for the county part, the polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2613)|
| 0:43:40| So there's not that many months difference between the county election and the city election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| So I don't know why we should go to this expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| Now, I mean, if you can explain it to me why we should just waste money when we've got safeguards in here to protect the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2631)|
| 0:43:58| And we didn't support, we didn't appoint Supreme Court justices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| These people are only going to be there until the next election if they're not reelected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| And if the people don't like what we did up here, they can vote against me too in 2010 or these other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2648)|
| 0:44:16| But I really feel like that we have guidelines that we are supposed to go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| And this book right here in the Constitution of the United States, I feel like we're just messing with it too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| This has been in effect since 1796.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| And now all of a sudden every time we've run into a problem, we want to run to Nashville and get them to pass a law for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| Now, that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| That's what's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Now, I hate and I don't mean anything derogatory about your profession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| but I feel like that our problem is we have too many lawyers in Nashville in the United States Congress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2681)|
| 0:44:47| Because I don't know what the word is means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| I found that out about 12 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| I thought I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| And I'm pretty old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| But apparently lawyers determined to us what the word means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| But I do know that the word shall means mandated, does it not, Bud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| And in this piece of paper right here and in this book right here, it says shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| We shall appoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| And that means we were ordered to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| Am I correct in that, Bud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| Well, as I understand it, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| I think that we should let things stand as they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| I cannot vote for a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Mr. Law Director, do you have any comments up to this point you want to make before we continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| Only to say that I guess I would have the same reservations about retroactivity of an ex post facto law on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2731)|
| 0:45:44| I would agree that the interpretation for at least a century| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| and perhaps centuries has been that when we talk about the next election, we're talking about the next general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2748)|
| 0:45:55| The next county general election is next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| The legislature has provided that in presidential preference primary years that this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2759)|
| 0:46:09| and any other Knox County official may run in that primary election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2769)|
| 0:46:16| I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| I guess I've read McPherson, Bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| And they had or are you saying that they ran at the next city election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| They, in the McPherson case, actually ran in the presidential primary in 1980.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| And let me clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Was that a partisan election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| It was ruled as a general election, so it was allowed to be partisan as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| But let me clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| We have primaries, too, you know, for our persons at least, which would have to be considered as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2803)|
| 0:46:51| And as you know, primaries are not provided for under the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| There's a lot of mechanisms in state law that allow you to determine how you make primary decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| But several of you keep referring to language that's been around for a hundred years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| Article 2, Section 2 was adopted in 1978.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| Article 7, Section 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| I keep saying Article 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| Article 7, Section 2 is a 1978 provision from the Constitutional Convention of that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| Actually, it was changed in 1978.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| The wording until the next election is new language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| It was changed by the limited Constitutional Convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| Frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| The law director answered some of the questions I was going to ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| But we also have a Knox County charter, and I think that charter is fact clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2868)|
| 0:47:58| I guess Mr. Gilbert then, he hadn't addressed that whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| But I guess the law would say then this would supersede our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| It would have to be a general law, and a general law always supersedes a charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| Well, I don't want to debate with an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| But you have for years, Commissioner, with great ability, too, I might add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2898)|
| 0:48:27| A general law addressing a particular situation in one county seems strange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2907)|
| 0:48:35| That would be a special act, and that would not work, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| It would have to be a general law that applies to all charter counties or to all 95 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| And that would depend very carefully on the form of the law that was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| You know, I added another wrinkle on that on top of your several wrinkles and subterfuges of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| You could do this and do this and do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| But this would be, you would have to admit, contrary to our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2936)|
| 0:49:04| even though you're saying we can get over the charter and overrule the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| but you have to admit that it would be contrary to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| And help running that charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| We try to follow the Constitution, state law, and we wrote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| We weren't trying to change things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| We put it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| But, in fact, it is in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| And a lot of people say, well, you weren't following the charter here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| And we had some opinion for certain offices that, from the Attorney General, that you asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2969)|
| 0:49:37| And you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| You did ask for the ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| Now we're coming back and saying, well, let's throw the charter out the window on this provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| because we don't like this provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| Well, we're just saying, so, well, the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| And I just have some problems that we can say, well, we can go to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| and we'll just override the Knox County charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| That's what you're advising us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| Because of the feeling of the state that they ought to override our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| But I really would like to ask the Law Department of the Knox County, in terms of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3005)|
| 0:50:13| whether his ruling is that we have some questions about the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3013)|
| 0:50:24| And Mr. Gilbert said that they didn't put the right question to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| I don't know whether they did or did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| Okay, I'm not going to go there because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| All I know is that the person opined no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| Maybe it was an improper question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| It's against the current state law by definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| Or you wouldn't be bringing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| It's against the current charter of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| And it's against the ruling of the Supreme Court of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| And you can argue, well, they didn't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| But I presume the Supreme Court could have gone where they wanted to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| And they could have done a lot of things, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| one of which would have kept those offices de facto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| They were de facto for a period of time, anyhow, by their definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| They could continue to 2008, the next general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| and then the former county commission here wouldn't have had to make any appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3072)|
| 0:51:19| There would have been new elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| Twelve people would have been replaced by definition and gone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| And that would have been the ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| That would have been the final ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| There would have been no appeal to that ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| They made some tough decisions whether to make the correct ones or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| In my case, it was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| But the other ones might have been all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| So I like how the law department really gave things to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| I have a question, too, is that we would have two county elections for 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| And then there's some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| There's school board races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| They're the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| They're the property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| So we'd have to immediately go into primaries in a general election for the other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| So you have people elected to county offices in two different manners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3119)|
| 0:52:07| Because I'm not sure, and you did not opine, whether you could move those elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3127)|
| 0:52:13| And maybe you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| I don't know whether you could or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| And you didn't opine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| But unless we can move them all, there would be increased costs because we're holding another election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3137)|
| 0:52:26| But if there is a change and the term is shortened, I did not ask for the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| As people know, I did not ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| And I will serve as long as it's valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| And I leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| I leave with no apologies and no regrets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| Commissioner, if I could, and I appreciate those points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| They're excellent points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| You know, I'm going to speak as a Knox County citizen of this county right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| Maybe you're not aware of what I'm aware of and what I hear every day on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| But we've got a political crisis right now in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| And I think the mayor's effort is only attempting to come to a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| that as quickly as possible lets the public of this county restore its confidence in its government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3186)|
| 0:53:12| You can pick at it all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| You can attack it all day long and find a hundred reasons not to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| But when it's all put down to its simplest form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| it's whether you're willing to try to do something to regain the public trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| And all of you are wonderful people who serve in a very difficult position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| This is just one opportunity to try to let the public speak again as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3215)|
| 0:53:42| And if you don't want to try it, vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| But if you think it has a chance and you'd like to have the tool in the toolbox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| because none of you know what's going to happen when the chancellor's finished with the two lawsuits that is before it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3228)|
| 0:53:54| and all of you, the eight that were recently appointed, may suddenly not be in your seats again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| you're going to want to have every tool possible to let the public speak as quickly as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| If you don't like that approach, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| It's no disrespect to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| It's no disrespect to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| The mayor is simply trying to respond to the public crises at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| We're using every tool and ability we can to give you options, alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3255)|
| 0:54:21| If you don't like it, vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| Can I ask a quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| This question that you and the mayor have asked the AG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3267)|
| 0:54:34| are you asking for a general election, for the general election next year to be moved up to this, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3274)|
| 0:54:42| August, November, July, November for all 95 counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| Well, Mr. Law Director, we haven't actually decided on the form of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| We were going to see what the AG advised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| I wasn't involved in the question, and so this is the first I've heard the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| And have you received a copy of Senator Burchett's attorney general opinion request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| I'll be glad to get you a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| But it's seven questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| It's very complete, and it's aimed at trying to get us the answer so we can make intelligent decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| But there would be great flexibility in what that law would look like if the AG says the legislature can define what the next election is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3314)|
| 0:55:22| It could be a special election called by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| You would decide when that election is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| It might be set in the legislation that it be the next municipal election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| There are a number of possibilities there if you're allowed to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| And you, by the way, would have an opportunity to make that decision when the actual legislation is formed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| because you'd get to vote on it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| So what you're asking this body to do is to vote on a measure that they really don't know the outcome?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3348)|
| 0:55:54| That law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| They've never seen the questions that have been asked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| As I understand the mayor's request, he's asking you to go on record to let your legislative delegation know that you are asking for this tool in the toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3359)|
| 0:56:06| The law, when it's formed, will probably have to be voted on again by this county commission before it will be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| My question is, what is the tool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| Well, apparently there are seven questions that are being asked of the attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| Has that request been shared with our legislative body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3382)|
| 0:56:30| I'll read question one from Senator Birch's letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| May the General Assembly pass a general law applicable to all counties of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| or just to counties that have adopted a charter form of government that defines the phrase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| next election, that's in quotes in Article 7, Section 2 of the state of Tennessee Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| to mean, quote, the earlier of, one, the next general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| or two, the date of a special election set by the county commission responsible for filling the vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3414)|
| 0:57:02| Such legislation would also authorize the county to conduct a countywide election in such event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| if that date of the election set by the county commission is earlier than the next general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| Question two, would the response to request number one differ if the subject legislation defined the phrase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| quote, next election, in Article 7, Section 2 of the Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| to mean the earlier of, one, the next general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| or two, the date of the next municipal election for the largest municipality in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| Those were the two vehicles that we thought the AG could focus on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| but to be honest with you, the county commission could direct us to have the legislation include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| another definition of what the next election is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3460)|
| 0:57:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| You know, we knew we may be in this pickle way before we were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| You know, back before the Bailey decision was handed down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| there was an opportunity to have 15 term limited offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| Fifteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| And during the charter commission discussions, it was discussed whether or not you could have special elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3485)|
| 0:58:12| You know, and I think it's very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| And nothing against elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| I'm all for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| You know, let that be known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| But we're wasting a lot of time and effort on doing something that may or may not get done, as Mr. Gilbert said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| The Attorney General of the State of Tennessee has said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| The Constitution says no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| Laws passed by the General Assembly say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| Our charter says no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| And I think this turmoil and this crisis that you describe it in, it will be taken care of in the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3514)|
| 0:58:41| These are district races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| Each district will stand on its own in February of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| That's when the next election is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| And having one in November until February just makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| This is a lot of work for little gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| November to February, you'll have your voice in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| And I think we've got a lot of work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| In the General Assembly, I read in the paper, there's more bills filed down there than there has been in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3540)|
| 0:59:06| But I think we need to get on with the county's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| And I don't think a special election is in our cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| With whatever we send to Nashville, I do not believe, I think it's a waste of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| I think it's a waste of Senator Burchett's time and the General Assembly's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| There's too much that has to be done to address our problems in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| when our problems have been addressed according to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| It's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| Commissioner Ivan Horman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| Yeah, I'd just like to say this commission appointed eight members to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| And I think that people feel like these eight members cannot make a good decision in the next 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3580)|
| 0:59:47| I think every one of these people, Mr. Lutho, I have a lot of respect for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| He's been on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| These other people that have been selected to serve this commission, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| have to step up and make good decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| I think they will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| If we put somebody on here that can't make that decision, then God help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| But I think we made the decision that these people have to step up and make our county move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| So I don't know what people are afraid of, these people we put on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| that can't decide on some kind of issues that's going to affect this county or that's going to bankrupt us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| I just think we made a great decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| Well, you know, we can all listen to this and make our points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| But I think there's two instant cases, one by Mr. Monsier that asked for a special election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| one by the new Sentinel that asked for an annulment, I guess is the best term, of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| And when we start talking about money, lawsuits are expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| We've seen it before I served on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| We're going to see it if these lawsuits go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| And I don't think that I'm misspeaking when I say that the public, in the best term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3648)|
| 1:00:55| was disappointed in the way that we conducted business on January 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| The lawsuits are outgrowth of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| We've seen the papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| We've seen the faxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| They outweigh it 10, 20 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| You know, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| That's the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| I think some of us is going to have to have a gut check on how we've done it personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3672)|
| 1:01:19| And, John, if you wouldn't mind to tell me, you've, to the law director, I'm sorry, that these, we do have two lawsuits, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3679)|
| 1:01:31| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| And hopefully I'll get to address the commission about one of those at our committee meetings here in just a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| But in bringing this up with the special election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| then that could be a tool that we may want to use if we think that the lawsuits could be a negative decision to the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3701)|
| 1:01:51| There's also, when I talk about a gut check, did we do it right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| Can we do it better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| Then we'll have to decide amongst ourselves now just like we made the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| And if we, if the answer to that is, hey, guys, we maybe didn't do it quite right without putting blame anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3723)|
| 1:02:11| I think there's plenty of blame for the last 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| We've had mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| We've had law directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| We've had commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| Now it's become a focal point for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| We're the ones that are getting kicked in the ass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| And, you know, the public out here are wanting the leadership to step forward and put some save on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3745)|
| 1:02:36| Now, we can talk about this special election here all that we want to, but it's not going to stop the two lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| It's not going to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| Can you imagine taking 19 depositions from the sitting commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| You've got 12 other office holders minus Billy Tindall out would be 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| That would be 30 people of their attorney's range scheduling and all like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| You don't think that won't cost what an election would cost, a special election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3778)|
| 1:03:05| We've seen the price tags in the paper by the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| Now, we can sit here and posture all that we want to, but it's not going to make those two lawsuits go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| And if we've done something wrong and we're not willing to admit it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| and we're not willing to do it, then they can go forward, possibly win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| I think there's a sentiment that they will win, at least the new Sentinel suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| So why are we going to churn the water and spend this money and maybe wind up with the same outcome?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3807)|
| 1:03:37| I guess that's what I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| I'll just add something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| I'll make sure that this commission is not suing anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| It's people suing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| And we're going to defend ourselves as any citizen in this county if someone sues you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| You know, if people want to talk about the money, I think the people suing us needs to have their gut check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3831)|
| 1:03:58| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3838)|
| 1:04:04| The money that's being spent is the taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| And if we've seen something that's not been done right, then we have a responsibility maybe to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| We've not had a lot of input from the law director at this time as to what he feels likes the temperature of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3852)|
| 1:04:22| the court, and the success maybe of the outcome of the suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3862)|
| 1:04:28| Well, I don't know where you all are talking about this public outcry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| I've had one call at my home about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| Well, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| And maybe I need to get my phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| You certainly don't live in District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| My number is 922-9049 because I've had one phone call against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| And people said we'd done a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| In fact, I've had many calls saying that we did what the law told us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| And people understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| You know, the governor has to make appointments sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| Certainly I probably don't agree with all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| But I don't run down there to the legislature or anybody else saying, Governor, you made a bad decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| And, you know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| I feel like we made the right decision, Commissioner Bowler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| Maybe you feel like you made bad decisions and broke the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| But I certainly don't feel that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| Maybe you can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| Well, I'm talking about the decisions to be made are in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| I'm not talking about going anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| Well, someone in this room would have had to broke the law for us to lose the lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3917)|
| 1:05:25| Maybe you're a great predictor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| I don't think any attorney that practices laws are not surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| Well, I don't think anybody ever goes to jail for something that they didn't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| I think most people do whatever act, if they get found by their jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3936)|
| 1:05:43| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| Commissioner Pinkston brought up the notion of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| The cost of this would be less than one percent of what we will spend on an unneeded business park over sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3949)|
| 1:05:56| The cost of this will be less than one percent of what we will spend on expanding the deputy pension fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| This sudden concern for the public purse is as refreshing as the sudden concern for public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3961)|
| 1:06:07| Requesting a special election through the reasoning just put forward is worth the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| Who knows, it may yield both more public input and a better concern for the public purse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| Now, losing an election is not impeachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| Failing to call an election or failing to give ourselves the tools to act if, as Commissioner Ballard suggests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| and I agree that we are likely to have serious problems, at least in one of these lawsuits, based on our bad behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3987)|
| 1:06:35| If we fail to do that, then we're straining the public credibility almost as much as we did on January 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| Mr. Chairman, I've got my cell phone out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| You now have two messages at home opposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| And there's plenty of faxes at the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| There's plenty of e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| Let's not forget to count commission at KnoxCounty.org where all of us get e-mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| and they have been overwhelmingly against our actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4014)|
| 1:07:02| And just for the record, for all the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| I believe we've had 57 e-mails since January 31st received in the Knox County Commission Office and not all of them negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4028)|
| 1:07:18| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| Bud, let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| What we've got in our package here just says a resolution too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| Is there a specific piece of paper you're asking us to vote on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| Good question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| I have not seen what you've been asked to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| I don't think the mayor has been given it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| I think I heard it read earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| And if I recall what was read, it was a request of the legislature to pass legislation that would allow you to have the special election earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4062)|
| 1:07:51| But I really would like to see the exact wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| You talked earlier about some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| Are those going to be submitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| I mean, what I'm asking is, when we vote today, exactly what are we voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| Is it just this one paragraph resolution or will there be more verbiage attached to it when it goes forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4081)|
| 1:08:08| No, I don't think there's supposed to be any more verbiage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| As I understand the request of the mayor, this is just for the legislative body to go on record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| the county commission to go on record with the Knox County delegation that you're asking for this relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4096)|
| 1:08:22| It does not define very narrowly what the relief is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4102)|
| 1:08:27| It's just saying that you'd like to have the special legislation to give you this tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| So there's some flexibility in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| And if the commission is concerned about that, we certainly can tighten up the wording to specify exactly what it is you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4113)|
| 1:08:40| This just really gets the ball rolling because, as most of you have read in the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4120)|
| 1:08:46| I think Senator Burchett and some others stated from the Knox County delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| that they were hesitant to introduce anything until the county commission spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| They wanted to defer to your good judgment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| So I think that was the genesis of this request, and the mayor may want to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| But the delegation serves you, tries to serve this body and has great respect to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| So until this commission acts to say you want them to try to pass this bill, they probably aren't going to try to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4148)|
| 1:09:15| I think that answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| There's nothing other than this one paragraph resolution that we're going to send to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| Mr. Goodman, what is the name of your law firm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| I'm employed by Kennerly, Montgomery & Finley, 550 Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| And, Mr. Mayor, did you speak to the law director about this before going to Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4175)|
| 1:09:45| The law director was at my press conference when we announced that I was going to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| Did he give you any guidance on the legalities of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| We discussed it and we also talked when I was in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| My concern about this is the reason why this trip to Nashville came about and this request for a special election came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4205)|
| 1:10:14| Now, I was for special elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| I felt like that would have been a much better way to replace these term-limited folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| But, unfortunately, the decision of the Supreme Court was not, you know, my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4220)|
| 1:10:27| They said we should have appointments and we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| And, you know, this whole situation just reminds me of when my nephew was a little boy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4230)|
| 1:10:37| and we were playing games like Candy Land and Monopoly and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| Well, my nephew would spin the wheel or he would roll the dice and he would get something that he didn't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4242)|
| 1:10:50| The dice wouldn't come out the way he wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| The spin wouldn't turn out the way he wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| And he wanted a do-over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| Well, it sounds to me like there are certain parties who stood up and said it's a good day in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4256)|
| 1:11:02| It's a great day that term limits are being upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| You know, we're going to have these appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| We're going to replace these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| It sounds like, you know, the mayor really stepped up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| and thought it was a great thing that we were going to have the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| Then he rolled the dice and he didn't get his choices on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| And now he's asking for a do-over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| Mayor, you're not four years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| We're not playing Candy Land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| I think that what you need to do is reach out to those of us on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| There's some fine folks up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| And work with what you've got rather than asking for a do-over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| and continuing to stir this pot and keeping this county in political turmoil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4298)|
| 1:11:45| Well, Mr. Lambert, with all due respect, I've never called you out individually, but I'm going to right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4305)|
| 1:11:52| That escapade you pulled with Mr. Wimmer in the back room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| is one reason why people want a do-over, as you call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4314)|
| 1:12:05| Just to answer that, there was no back room involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| Any conversation I had with Mr. Wimmer was out in the middle of the press and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4328)|
| 1:12:14| If that wasn't sunshine, I don't know what is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| I think most of our citizens concur with your assessment of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| But I haven't been critical of any of the appointees, nor will I be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| I do think, however, our public would like the opportunity to vote on that, and that's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| I'm not going to go around the room and pick out individuals to call on, including you, until you did it with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4349)|
| 1:12:36| But if you don't think that our citizens want to vote on this earlier, vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| If you think they would like to, vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| That's what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| You've never heard me say, let's do this over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| I'm just saying, let our citizens vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| Now, what the lawsuits, when those come down, those will be things that may impact it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| But I haven't brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| Why didn't we let them vote in the first place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| Because the Supreme Court was very clear on how these folks were to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| We fulfilled the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| We did our duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| And now I think we need to live with their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| We need to quit this bickering amongst each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| We need to get together somewhere and sit down and talk like human beings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| and find a way to work with each other instead of continuously stirring this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| I'm very confident, I feel very certain that if there were different folks on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4407)|
| 1:13:34| especially in certain seats, that there would be no call for special elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4414)|
| 1:13:40| You know, I believe that if there were certain folks on this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| and if certain folks weren't on this commission, that none of this stuff would be brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| We would be pulling together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| You'd be wanting to work with folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| I believe that this is a political ploy because certain folks got on this commission that you didn't approve of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4431)|
| 1:13:58| And I think that it's time that we quit playing these political football games| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| and we settle down and we do the people's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| With all due respect, you're completely wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| Okay, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| Yes, this is answering to Mr. Harmon over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4452)|
| 1:14:17| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| We have a representative form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| So I feel like the people are involved in everything we do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| They've elected us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| Now, Commissioner Ballard here, I want to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| I make no votes up here on the pretext of trying to be elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| I don't care whether I'm politically correct or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| I make the votes that I think are the best for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| And if the people, like I say, don't want me, they don't have to vote me in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| And I think everybody up here should make their votes like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| It's what's best for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| But, Mr. Harmon, you're talking about the cost of this election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| and what percentage it is and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| The people voted in the sheriff's pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| Mr. Harmon, I'm going to go back to what my grandfather told me years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| If you watch your pennies, the dollars will watch their sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| Now, I don't live high, and I don't live on credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| and that's what we're trying to do here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| And everything we spend up here, the taxpayers' money that's spent foolishly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| costs them down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| And I just want to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| We're not cutting the people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4524)|
| 1:15:25| Everybody keeps hollering about election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| Are we not going to have an election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| Who here says we're denying the people an election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| We're not denying them an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| They're going to have an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| It's just going to be a few months away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| So I don't know what we're even talking about special elections for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| I'm not cutting the people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| I'm not up here voting against this general election that we've got coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| or the presidential primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| I want the people to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| The only thing I'm saying is we should not have a special election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| because it's not in the Constitution or the charter of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| Now, if we're going to go to Nashville every time we have a hard vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| or we're going to go out here and talk to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| we don't need to be sitting up here in these seats if we can't make these hard decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| That's what we're here for is to make them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| And if the people don't like it, they've got a check and balance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| Vote us out of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| But we're here to make these decisions, and that's what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| And I'm against a special election, and I'll say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| We've got an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| I'm not cutting the people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| They have the right to vote when the election is held like the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| and like the Supreme Court says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| Commissioner Craig Luteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| Bud, could you answer a question for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| I'll try, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| Have you already presented these questions to the State Attorney General?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| Senator Burchett's opinion was delivered on February 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| And when do you expect a response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| That's hard to say with the AG's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| I know they think this is a very important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| I talked with the attorney who is answering the question last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| but they could give me no assurance when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| They were aware of your meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| That would take care of the constitutionality as far as the state constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4625)|
| 1:17:12| Where are we supposed to get the answer of whether or not we get over our charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| Oh, I think that's, I would defer to your good county attorney, my county attorney too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4637)|
| 1:17:24| I think that's a clear precedent in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| General laws can override charters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| The charter that the people of Knox County adopted has always been subject to the general law of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4649)|
| 1:17:37| So we would need, in order to do this, we would have to get a ruling from the State Attorney General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4657)|
| 1:17:44| in order to proceed on as far as on the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4664)|
| 1:17:49| Technically, you don't have to have that, but probably to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| I would hate to hold an election that then became void because someone brought up another lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4672)|
| 1:17:59| that says we didn't hold a legal election, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| And you're astute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| I mean, someone could challenge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| I mean, we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| So we would want to make sure if we did this, we were within the constitution of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| And on square footing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| But we'd also have to make sure that we're on sound footing with our own charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4693)|
| 1:18:20| And where do we get the answer for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| I mean, you might get an AG's opinion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| You certainly could get the opinion of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| But the only, all you'd have is opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| But there's considerable case law that suggests the proposition that general laws override charters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4714)|
| 1:18:41| Even with the newfound power, I think, that the Supreme Court just gave charter reforms to government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| I mean, have you considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| Not with that exact language, but I don't think that decision cuts away from the proposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| that charters are subject to the general laws of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| As I would like to see, I mean, I've always preferred that the people decide who the representatives are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4739)|
| 1:19:06| And I would like to have an election when we're allowed to have an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4746)|
| 1:19:12| That certainly is the mayor's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| The problem is, I'm trying to figure out, can we do it lawfully?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| That's my quandary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| That's the $60,000 question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| Mr. Law Director, in your opinion, can we hold a special election this fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4763)|
| 1:19:32| according to the charter of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| Not according to the charter and not according to the state constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| or the laws of the state of Tennessee as they exist now, as they exist today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| If the call for this meeting was for this body to vote on a special election to be held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4785)|
| 1:19:53| Where's my?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| For a special election to be held on September 25 and November 6 of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4796)|
| 1:20:07| It is not a call for a general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| It is not a call for a change in state law for there to be a change in charter counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4809)|
| 1:20:15| or in all 95 counties or whatever for the general law to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| This is a request by the mayor to have a special call meeting to authorize a special election in 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4819)|
| 1:20:29| for the recently appointed 12 county officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| That's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| And it sounds like there's several more layers to this than what is in the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4836)|
| 1:20:45| In your opinion, can we proceed on with what Mr. Gilbert has asked us to do today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4845)|
| 1:20:58| as far as the questions that are being put before the state attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| so that, I mean, because we have a special call meeting that says one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4863)|
| 1:21:10| and you're saying that we're asking for something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4870)|
| 1:21:16| Is that your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| The call is for a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| Now, maybe the mayor needed to rephrase that, but they're clearly asking for an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4880)|
| 1:21:31| They're clearly asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| Is it close enough to the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| Yes, probably so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| I guess my question is, if the state attorney general opines that state law can be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4897)|
| 1:21:51| that we can hold that, do we still, can it be, in your opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4911)|
| 1:21:58| can we get over what it says in our charter that we can still hold that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4918)|
| 1:22:07| Probably so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| If the state tells us that our election, which is scheduled for next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| is actually going to be held in September and November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4934)|
| 1:22:24| they make the laws, and we have to abide by those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| and those, in just about every occurrence, supersede the county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4949)|
| 1:22:39| My question becomes what effect it will have, what's the retroactive effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4959)|
| 1:22:48| and there are a number of legal issues that are involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| and hopefully the attorney general will give us some guidance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4971)|
| 1:22:57| I don't know if this helps the commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| but you have to remember when the charter was written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| and even when Article 7, Section 2 was written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| it's understandable that when we thought about vacancies in county offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| we thought about the typical vacancy that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| Someone dies in office, someone's ill, you replace one vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| I don't think any of the framers of those provisions had in their minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| an occurrence as catastrophic as this occurrence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| where you lose 8 of 19 commissioners, 4 of 6 county constitutional offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5002)|
| 1:23:28| No one contemplated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| So the legislature has the ability to act in a remedial way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| for special circumstances like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| and the nature of this law that we would submit to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| would be tailored to those kind of catastrophic events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| where you lose more than 25% of your county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| more than a third of your constitutional officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| so it would have a narrow application, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| by effect on only very few situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| but it would be written in a way that certainly applied to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| That's why it would be a general law, and that's why it would supersede the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5040)|
| 1:24:06| Let me ask you, Bud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| do you need a vote today in order to get the opinion back from the state attorney general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| The opinion will come on its own, regardless of what this body does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5054)|
| 1:24:20| And as far as timing, as far as we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| so that we sit here and we wrestle with whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| or not this is something that we could do legally or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| is this not something that maybe we could wait for that opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| or do we need to act on this today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| I probably should defer to the mayor on that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| That's your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| I made it really clear when I announced this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| that I wouldn't be lobbying any of you one way or the other, and I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| But it's your decision now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| I think you need to let the General Assembly know whether you have any interest or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| If you do, then they can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| If you say no, then I think they wouldn't pursue it any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5103)|
| 1:25:10| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| I don't see any more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| I have a couple of questions, and I'm going to call for the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| I think we all know how we're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| You had mentioned, Mr. Law Director, that we had September and November as the election dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| Where am I missing February?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| That's what's in the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| You're missing February because we're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| The call for this meeting from the Mayor was for elections to be held to coincide with the city elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5132)|
| 1:25:39| We're talking about this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5139)|
| 1:25:40| September 25, 2007 and November 6, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5143)|
| 1:25:44| I want to clarify that because we are looking at possibly, if this doesn't pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| we're looking at a February date for the primaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| February 12, I believe, and August 7, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| I have always been in favor of the special election from day one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| and will be voting in favor of the special election and for this reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| I believe this is what the people want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| In going around and talking to a lot of people since January 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| I've probably had, and I've tried to count, about 300 people who have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| if you can vote sooner rather than later, do you want to vote sooner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| And I've probably had 10 people who have said no, approximately 300 people who have said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| I really believe that the people want to vote sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| The notion that this is a do-over or the notion that this is some kind of an impeachment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| there is nothing that we as a body can do to even address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| because the only people that can do a do-over is a judge or the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5195)|
| 1:26:41| I'm assuming that most of these 12 are going to run for election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| They're going to put themselves before the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| They're going to take their positions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| They're going to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| They're going to knock on doors, go to PTA meetings, do all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| And so the citizens of Knox County will determine who their representatives are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| I fully expect that we're going to see some, if not all, of these faces back on commission after Election Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5219)|
| 1:27:06| whether it's this fall or next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| So the notion that this is somehow an attempt to do a do-over, that's just not in the cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| You can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| This is not an impeachment of anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| We can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| This is just a matter of saying, are we going to let the citizens vote sooner rather than later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5238)|
| 1:27:23| I'm convinced that the citizens want to vote sooner, as quickly as possible, to let their positions be known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5243)|
| 1:27:30| And, again, I fully expect that we'll see a lot of these folks back on commission, possibly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| after they take their messages to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| But this is just an opportunity for them to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| So, Mr. Chairman, with that, I will call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| Commissioner Hammond, before we do that, we don't even have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| I'll make a motion that we approve the special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| Okay, we're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| Mr. Chairman, I just want to disclose that I do work for the Knox County trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5277)|
| 1:28:04| And I do have family members who work for the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| I think people understand that by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| I also have people who work for the sheriff's department and a son that works for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5290)|
| 1:28:15| Of course, I've been here three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| My wife's been here about 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| I guess I shouldn't have run for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| I want to also disclose that I work for county clerk's office, Kathy Quist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| and my husband works for the Knox County sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5308)|
| 1:28:32| And I work for the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| Are we all confessing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| I guess the newspaper missed a couple of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| I want to make sure they get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| My daughter-in-law works for Mike Lowe out in the halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| And my daughter teaches at Pleasure Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| My son-in-law is a teacher at West High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| They do an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| They got their job before I was on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| So if you want to kick us out because our families have to work, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5331)|
| 1:28:57| And my sister also works for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| Been there for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| And I have an aunt that retired from the school system too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| Just want to make sure everybody understands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| Ladies and gentlemen, we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| We'll start in the ninth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5348)|
| 1:29:09| A vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| We'll be voting for asking the legislature to do some kind of language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5350)|
| 1:29:16| that they will pass a special election for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| Voting no means you don't want a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| Election will be in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5361)|
| 1:29:26| In the ninth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5366)|

| 1:30:22| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| Commissioner Ballard, you vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| Commissioner Ballard votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| Is there any other pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| Okay, the chair's seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5435)|
| 1:30:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| Okay, we had eight ayes, ten noes, and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| So the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5450)|
| 1:30:51| Mr. Chairman, thank you for the extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| I appreciate it, and thanks to each of you for coming to the special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| Okay, we'll take about a five-minute bathroom break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| Mr. Chairman, do we not have still the business of appointing the newly commissioners to committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| We do have a special call meeting, but I'm going to call for a bathroom break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| Commissioners, if you'll take your seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| No, he stays because we cannot change the BCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| You do know how to be a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| So that's what the law director advised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5480)|
| 1:31:26| They got a term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| All he wanted to do was serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5493)|
| 1:31:39| Okay, clerk, I guess if you'll call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5499)|

| 1:32:21| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| Okay, clerk, we have all 19 members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| Clerk, second item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Noss County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| approving committee appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| Okay, I've passed out a sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| Some of it needs to be approved by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| but I thought it would just be best that we approve everything on an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| intergovernmental committee and a finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| We'll break into committees in just a few moments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| and elect your chairman and vice chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5568)|
| 1:32:53| So if I have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| Mr. Chairman, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| It seems that I've been added to the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| and I wondered if that is a mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| that it was an intent to perhaps put Commissioner Bolus there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| because traditionally if you're on Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| you're not on beer board and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| Was there a typo or error in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| It very well may have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| If you all want to discuss maybe what you want to be on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| or Commissioner Bolus is at school a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| so maybe I don't know what your time is like, Mr. Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5604)|
| 1:33:35| Harmon, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5615)|
| 1:33:48| Mr. Mohr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5628)|
| 1:33:49| We're just curious, the timing of beer board, when does it meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| It's right before commission, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| So if Mr. Bolus wants to serve on that as a commission day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| you'd probably be off anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| Mr. Mohr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| Did we not vote to make this a one-time appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| where you could appoint everybody to the board that you wanted them on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| We did last time on your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| I believe that was unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| I think we need to let everything stand unless people want to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| or something theirself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| Okay, we'll put Commissioner Bolus on there on the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| It meets the same day as commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| Commissioner Pinks, do you want to make that a motion just to approve this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| Okay, do we have a second by Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| No, I was just going to ask a question about the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| We have some outstanding individuals there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| but we obviously have someone on our board that has many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| many years with regards to pension and finance, and that's Frank Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| And so I'm not sure if there's room for that or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| or if Mr. Luthold would even consider serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| I guess if you want to put his name into the thing, we can take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5691)|
| 1:34:56| I'd like to make a motion that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| Okay, we'll add Frank Luthold on to the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| Commissioner Ivan Harmon is already on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| I'm not against Commissioner Luthold being on this pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| I think he would probably be an asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| But this is what I've been talking about, about our charter and our thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| We do not change the rules in the middle of a game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| We voted on this unanimously last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5719)|
| 1:35:25| And I believe Commissioner Hammond voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| This was to be a one-time deal for your appointments only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| and I think we need to stay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| Now, the people can get together and elect the chair if they want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| but these appointments and the way we split it up there was left up to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| Mr. Chairman, could I ask the law director for a ruling on the appointments to the pension board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| And let me just give you some background on why I did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| These pension board appointments are appointments for a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| Some of the people could be going off this committee next year, possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5753)|
| 1:35:59| I think Commissioner Luthold said he wasn't going to run again, but he may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| That's his decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| We were trying to bring some stability to the pension board for a four-year term to end in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| So that was kind of my background of why I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| But certainly the law director can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| And I talked with the chair about this earlier, too, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| The retirement pension board is somewhat different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| There is a special provision in our charter which requires that its members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| four members of the commission, are selected by a majority vote of the membership of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5791)|
| 1:36:39| It seemed to me that the best policy was for this commission to vote not only on this appointment specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5799)|
| 1:36:46| but for all the rest, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| And I'm in agreement that we need to abide by the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| I'm in full agreement with Mr. Pinkston on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| We'll vote on everything except we'll take the pension board out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| We've got a motion made and properly seconded on the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| Commissioner Luthold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5825)|
| 1:37:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| Do we have room on the arena committee, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| I think we only have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| You can only have three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| I will be glad to come off of the pension board and put Commissioner Luthold in my place on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| I think he's more qualified than me if that would satisfy the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| But I just think we don't need to change the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| Well, we've got to vote, so let's just vote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| So on the rest of the committee, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| Okay, we're on the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| I guess, Mr. Law Director, we take people individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5860)|
| 1:37:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| We'll start with Paul Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| Do we need a motion to approve him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| I'll make a motion that we approve Paul Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| Seconded by Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| Okay, Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| We'll go Scott Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| Motion made by Commissioner Trammell, seconded by Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5887)|
| 1:38:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| Third member, Thomas Tank Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| Motion made by Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| Second by Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5902)|
| 1:38:23| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5903)|
| 1:38:26| And ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| And then that's the three spots that we had left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5912)|
| 1:38:33| At this time, I guess this ends our special call meeting of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| If we'll break in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| Mr. Chairman, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| I think Paul said something about the chairs and vice chairs for all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5921)|
| 1:38:46| committees have to be voted on by those committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5931)|
| 1:38:52| We're just going to vote on the intergovernmental and the finance chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| How about beer board would have to be separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| That's a separate board in itself as well, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| They will select their chair at this beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| They will accept the chairs at the beer board, so just strike out what we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| penciled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| Yeah, we just need to make sure we're following the correct procedures on all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| of these boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5951)|
| 1:39:12| Mr. Chairman, also a typographical error under Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| It has Mark Kaywood listed as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| I assume that's not intended because he is no longer a member of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| No, I'll let the law director explain that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| He explained it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| He just thought he was term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| The Board of Zoning Appeals, they are elected to terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5971)|
| 1:39:44| and those terms are four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| And so by the mere fact that commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| And there is no provision that requires that a Board of Zoning Appeal member be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5991)|
| 1:39:57| a county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| And this has occurred in the past, early 90s, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6000)|
| 1:40:10| But there is nothing to prohibit Citizen Kaywood from serving on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6010)|
| 1:40:18| And so those committee members should not be removed unless they decide to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| resign from those committees, from BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6022)|
| 1:40:27| That goes with Commissioner Diane Jordan, or now Citizen Diane Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6032)|
| 1:40:33| She should be there as well as Phil Gouda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6033)|
| 1:40:37| Phil Gouda, we contacted him, and he was the only one that said he would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6037)|
| 1:40:40| serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| He needs to provide the commission office with a letter of resignation from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| that committee so we can make sure that is documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6045)|
| 1:40:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| We'll have our commission staff ask him to submit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6051)|
| 1:40:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| Well, I guess getting back to that, though, you've got Lee Tramwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6058)|
| 1:41:03| I mean, can we appoint him to the BZA prior to Mr. Gouda turning in his resignation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6063)|
| 1:41:15| Apparently he's made this known to the chair, to the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| I mean, I think you can go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| If he doesn't carry through with it, then obviously the action of the commission today would be void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6082)|
| 1:41:27| Well, should we make the action today just be pending his resignation or just so that we stay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6087)|
| 1:41:33| You can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| Apparently he's already expressed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| All I'm saying is I would prefer that he would do that in writing so that we could document it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6097)|
| 1:41:42| I just want to make sure we've done this within the framework of our charter and applicable laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6102)|
| 1:41:48| I mean, I don't have a problem with Lee Tramwell serving there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| He's an excellent choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| I just want to make sure we've got him there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| Well, this is what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| We can leave Mr. Tramwell off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| As soon as we get a letter from former Commissioner Phil Gouda, then we can make the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6118)|
| 1:42:07| I mean, however we need to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| Whatever the law director tells us we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| Phil Gouda apparently has already expressed his desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| Yes, he did it to the commission office, to Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6137)|
| 1:42:18| And that was by phone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6138)|
| 1:42:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| All I'm saying is we need to document it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| I think that you could accept that statement as far as a resignation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| but I would like to see it in writing so that we'll have that for posterity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| Mr. Chairman, let me try a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| I'd make a motion we appoint Mr. Tramwell subject to receipt by the law director of the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6153)|
| 1:42:39| It would be to the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| To the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| And once that letter's in, then Mr. Tramwell can take office and we can go on about our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6167)|
| 1:42:48| If we don't have any objections to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| I see no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6173)|
| 1:42:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6175)|
| 1:42:56| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6176)|
| 1:42:57| Oh, I was going to make the same suggestion that Mr. Cate did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| I seem to recall this body at one point passing a contingent property tax if the wheel tax had not passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6180)|
| 1:43:07| So I see no problem with us appointing Mr. Tramwell contingent upon receiving this letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6187)|
| 1:43:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6194)|
| 1:43:15| What we need to do now is to break into the two committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| And let's take intergovernmental first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| I guess we can all sit here while we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| It shouldn't take too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6202)|
| 1:43:23| Commissioner Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| Commissioner Tony Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| Commissioner Richard Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| Scott Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6210)|
| 1:43:31| And Commissioner Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| So I guess we can call or somebody can call Mr. Law Director to send the intergovernmental meeting to order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6213)|
| 1:43:39| to make a nomination for chairman of that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6219)|
| 1:43:44| And I'll make a nomination that we nominate Craig Leuthold as chairman of intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6224)|
| 1:43:49| I will second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| Seconded by Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6233)|

| 1:43:57| And now we need a vice chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| I would like to nominate Tony Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| Tony Norman has been nominated for vice chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| Seconded by Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6249)|

| 1:44:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| I guess we can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| The finance committee needs to do their own, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6256)|
| 1:44:17| But Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| Commissioner Bolas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6259)|
| 1:44:20| Commissioner Lee Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6260)|

| 1:44:25| Commissioner Jack Huddleston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| And Commissioner Paul Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| If you want to handle that, Mr. Vice Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6267)|
| 1:44:31| Do we have any nominations for chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| I nominate Paul Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| We have Paul Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| Are there any other nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6281)|

| 1:44:45| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| Paul Pinkston is the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| Now we need to have a vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| Do I have any nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| I'd like to make a motion for Mr. Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| We have a nomination of Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| Are there any other nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| Seeing none, can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| Second from Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| All in favor of Ivan Harmon say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6309)|

| 1:45:13| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| Ivan Harmon is the vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| The Intergovernmental will meet in approximately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| the clerk needs just a couple of minutes to go make some copies of the new committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| We're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| Oh, they're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6326)|
| 1:45:27| I guess if the Intergovernmental Committee wants to meet now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6327)|
| 1:45:32| We shall meet right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070220special?start=6332)|
