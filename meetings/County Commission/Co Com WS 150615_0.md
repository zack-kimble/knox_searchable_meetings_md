| 0:00:21| All members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=21)|
| 0:00:23| Commissioner Brown, will you lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=23)|
| 0:00:28| Please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=28)|
| 0:00:32| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=32)|
| 0:00:38| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=38)|
| 0:00:53| Are there any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=53)|
| 0:00:55| I sent out the consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=55)|
| 0:00:57| I do want to change one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=57)|
| 0:00:59| It was 55 instead of 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=59)|
| 0:01:03| 55 instead of 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=63)|
| 0:01:07| So 9, 55, 62, 63, and 66 are not on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=67)|
| 0:01:12| I got one to pull and one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=73)|

| 0:01:29| And what's your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=89)|
| 0:01:31| Is it in regard to that, or is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| It's on the forensic center when I did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=92)|
| 0:01:34| I just pulled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| I just took it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=96)|
| 0:01:38| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=98)|
| 0:01:47| 203, is that what you're pulling off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=107)|

| 0:01:55| I'd like to put a discussion item on there to discuss the non-renewal of teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=115)|
| 0:02:04| But I'd like to, unless someone in audience wants to speak to it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| I'd like to discuss it next week, if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=127)|

| 0:02:15| before we move it to next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=135)|

| 0:02:40| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=160)|

| 0:02:49| Any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| Is there a motion to, with, I need a motion for the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=172)|
| 0:03:01| Add, withdraw, defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| Can you put the consent in there also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| The consent be said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=196)|

| 0:03:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=197)|
| 0:03:24| If y'all don't mind, I'll take a moment of privilege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| and allow Clark Hammond to, he wanted to come and speak to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| in regard to an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| Do y'all mind if we move it up to the front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| No, make him sit and wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| Make him wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| After all those years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| Where's the love?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=223)|
| 0:03:43| Where's the love?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| We can hear you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| What's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| I'm going to make the guy behind him wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| Which item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=232)|
| 0:03:52| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| Which item is it, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| Is it 60?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=238)|
| 0:03:58| 62, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| I don't know, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| He's got two banker boxes worth of papers to talk about back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| We're not talking to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| You got five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| But as he said, he knows how to speak in two-minute sound bites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| Is that the two-third majority of the five to all criminal Fourth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| Circuit criminal sessions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Go ahead, Madam Clerk, if you'll read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| This is resolution R-15-6-903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| It's to impose a litigation tax of $5 on all criminal court, Fourth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| Circuit court, and criminal sessions court cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| to be used exclusively by the clerk of the Fourth Circuit court upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| adoption of a two-third majority vote of the county legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| pursuant to public chapter number 327 of the Public Acts of 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| which amends Tennessee Code annotated subsection 67-4-601.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=287)|
| 0:04:47| Motion is second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| I have a brief presentation for you on your screens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| I'll be asking Jolie to click through those as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| And I'll move forward quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| Basically, what we have in our Fourth Circuit court is an unfunded mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| And I will explain exactly what I mean by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| When I sat in your chairs, we very rarely talked about the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| I'm not sure why that is, except we just didn't really have any need at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| that time to really talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| And no one came forward to express a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| I'm here today to express a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| I'm pulling back the curtains on our Fourth Circuit office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| What is the Fourth Circuit office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| If I could have the next slide, Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| What that court does is it is our family court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| It is our domestic relations court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| It's a very important court in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| We provide orders of protection, divorce, child support, child custody, juvenile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| court petitions, adoptions, and we work with domestic violence advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| Next slide, Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| Here are the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| From July 2014 through May 2015, the clerk's office processed 7,169 cases in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=347)|
| 0:05:55| that office alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| Of that number, 4,002 were orders of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| Now, this represents approximately 60% of the cases in Fourth Circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| Every case has to have a file and paperwork, and that's what these boxes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=368)|
| 0:06:18| This represents one case, one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| This box is filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| We have three of these files in this box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| I have a second box that's also filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| You can see the paperwork necessary for this one case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| So I wanted to show you the magnitude of what we deal with when we deal with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| paperwork and the files that are in that court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| Our job is to maintain the records of the court and to collect fines, fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| forfeitures, and any other related court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=409)|
| 0:06:56| I want to move through and give you some numbers, but the one number that I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| you to remember is zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| Tennessee Code Annotated 36-3-617 prohibits the clerk from charging for orders of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| protection, which includes filing, issuance, registration, service, dismissal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| and appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| Now, persons can file as many orders as they deem necessary, and no charges are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| to be levied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| Sixty percent of our cases are orders of protection, and we cannot collect a dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=439)|
| 0:07:26| And as I mentioned, people can file as many orders as they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| We cannot charge for any of those that are being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| So imagine it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| You go down to Calhoun's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| Sixty percent of the people that walk in the door there are going to be fed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| They're going to have beverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| They're going to receive service and so forth, but they're never going to pay you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| You're going to have to make your money off of 40 percent of the people that come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| through the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| This is what we're facing now in Fourth Circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| We want to talk to you about the litigation tax, and I know that when I was sitting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| your seat, the word tax made me shudder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| And I was thinking, oh, no, no, no, wait, wait just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| But the litigation tax is provided by the state, and the state allows counties to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| a litigation tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| And this is used already to fund such items as courthouse security, already the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| retirement of school debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| We pay fees to the public defender's office, the sheriff, the district attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| Now, in addition to the litigation tax, I wanted to let you know that our office pays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| into 33 county accounts from the fees, fines, and litigation taxes that we collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| Here's the current county litigation tax, just in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| Now, we have the state, but this is just the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| We have a basic litigation tax, which is 2850.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| We've been collecting that for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| Our office, by the way, through May of this year, all three of our offices, from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=523)|
| 0:08:50| Criminal to Sessions to Fourth Circuit, has collected $465,034 in litigation tax, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| has gone into your general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| So this is money that is there in the coffers of Knox County, and we collect that on a monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| basis and turn it over to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| Jail construction, courthouse security, school debt, victim offender, county library tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| victim assistance, which is our family court, all of these are already being collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| Jolie, next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| I also wanted to give you another magnitude of what our office does for Knox County, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| most people don't realize this, and I wanted a chance to brag on our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| Our Fourth Circuit office, just that one office, has paid to Knox County and the state $245,627.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=565)|
| 0:09:34| And that's just that one office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| From July through May, our Sessions court has paid Knox County $2.4 million, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=576)|
| 0:09:44| part of the 33 accounts I was telling you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| Our Criminal Court clerk's office has paid Knox County $556,000, so our grand total is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| $3.2 million already this fiscal year into the 33 Knox County accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| If you break it down, that's basically three cents on the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| So operating Fourth Circuit, when I became the clerk and we looked at that office and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| we started looking at the financial situation in that office, it became very apparent that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| I had to make some adjustments pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| And so, basically, we had to let two of our employees go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| Not something I wanted to do, but I felt like we needed to act responsibly and we needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| to act in a fiscal manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| The second thing that we did was we decided to go to Nashville and talk with our representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| there about the opportunity to come before you to ask for a $5 increase in the litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| Senator Briggs and Representative Haynes carried the bill for us in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| It went through every committee unanimously, and it passed the Senate unanimously, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| we had three quarters of the House vote in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| So the legislature, we made our case to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| They allowed us to come and make this same case to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| We have nine full-time employees down from 11 in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| We have one employee that's funded by a federal grant, and we have one employee that is assigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| to child support over in the old courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| Next slide, Jody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| So what's the cost of running it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| Again, we are a fee office, and so our job is to collect those fees we pay for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=665)|
| 0:11:12| You do not pay our salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| You don't pay our benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| You don't pay any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| We do, and it comes from what we collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| So after we've paid into these 33 accounts, what we have left over is ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| The amount collected in our clerk fee, and that's the clerk fee, what we have left over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| that we can pay our bills for, was $356,682.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| Our salaries for that office is $543,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| So we're losing about $20,000 a month in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| So the question that you might ask is, well, why don't you just make more cuts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| Why don't you have more people to let them go or bring Pellissippi students in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=704)|
| 0:11:51| They have a criminal justice program over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| You can hire cheaper people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| I remind you that this is one of the most important courts in our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| It's the family court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| We deal with relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| We deal with children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| We deal with orders of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| We deal with divorce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| All of those things I mentioned to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| If you want experienced people there to process that paperwork, going into court with paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| that is not accurate, that is not what it is supposed to be, can be devastating to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| Right now, the people that I have working in there have 133 years' experience working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| So when people come to our counter and they ask for paperwork for divorce, child custody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| an order of protection, they may be from out of state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| We get into that situation a lot where you might have a divorce situation where one party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| has moved out of state or out of county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| We have to help them with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| We can't give legal advice, but we can put them in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| Paternity, third-party divorces, annulments, the judge will have questions for us when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| they come into the office or when our people are on the bench with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| Has there been service provided to the orders of protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| In other words, have they served the person who the order of protection is on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| Are there attachments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| Dismissals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| Attorney appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Resets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Jail cases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| It's extremely involved and it's extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| So what we're suggesting to you is a $5 increase in the litigation tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| The tax has already been paid, so let me address two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| Who will not pay this tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| People who take out orders of protection are not charged anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| They won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| They never will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| Persons who are poor will not pay this tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| Because if you're poor and you file an order of indigency and the judge grants it, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| don't pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| And so the poor will not be paying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| But this litigation tax will be placed on cases not only in Fourth Circuit, but in criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| sessions and our criminal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| We believe, a conservative estimate, is that we will bring in approximately $120,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| And the way the state law is written, it must be used for the operation of Fourth Circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| In other words, we can't use it for anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| It has to go for that court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| So we feel like that as we continue to look for efficiencies there, and as we're more aggressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| in our cost collection efforts, which we are, again, that's our mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| We are to collect these fees and fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| We believe that we will be able to break even in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| If I can break even, I'll come back and do a happy dance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| Because that means that we will be able to turn over more fees to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| My last slide, Jolie, is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| In the last five years, no excess fees were turned over in our office in fiscal year 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| 12, or 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| Now, as I mentioned to you, we do pay Knox County through the regular course of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| but we're talking about excess fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| After we've paid all of our bills, and we have excess monies, we want to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| turn that over to Knox County, which will go into the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| $600,000 was turned over in fiscal year 2014, and as you may recall, $600,000 was turned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| over the month before I took office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| That depleted our bank account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| We had no money, and so generously, you agreed to let us take that $600,000 and put it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| in our bank account because, according to the law, we must have three months operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| expenses in our bank account to meet our payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| So again, I want to thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| But that's the situation that we find ourselves in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| I'm here today to ask you to give us that opportunity to collect that $5 with the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| going exclusively to the court, the Fourth Circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| Dr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| I've seen Mike do a happy dance before when we were the number one radio station in America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=931)|
| 0:15:41| and it's kind of interesting, so I'd love to see him come back and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| The second question I have, or the second thing I want to mention is, Mike, what percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| of people that owe money to the court ever end up paying it in full, or majority of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| Is it 20 percent, 40, 60, what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| It's probably going to be, it'll be less than 50 percent, I don't have the exact number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| for you, but what we do with a lot of people is we work out cost agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| So they may come out of court and they may, you know, owe whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| Most people will come to our counter, some people can pay, some people work out a cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| agreement where they do monthly payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| That's where we get the bulk of it, and a lot of those people will make those monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| payments, some don't, and that's when we have to do our collection efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| I would say you're probably looking at closer to maybe even 30 percent than you are closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| to the 50 percent, because, again, once they leave our counter, we aggressively try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=992)|
| 0:16:39| go after it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| We have a collection company and all of that, but sometimes the folks are very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| And the last thing I would mention, is this really enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| Because it looks like you're still short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| I mean, we're going to fix the problem, why don't we just fix it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| Is that enough or is that all we could do anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| Well, the $5 was what the legislature agreed to, and so I can't ask you for more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| I would have to go back to the legislature, but we really feel that with the $5, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| that's a conservative number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| We're getting very aggressive now in our cost collections, and we feel like it'll be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| But we also feel that, again, with what we're doing now, and looking at our projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| we feel like that we should be able to break even and maybe even start making a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| money in that court, maybe in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| And that's when the happy dance comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| That's right, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| All right, so what we have before you, commissioners, before we vote, we have a motion to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| and I know this, I guess next week is really the main vote, and this won't be on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| next week because it has to have a two-third majority, so we've got to do a roll call on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| So, today, I guess we'll just do a voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| Next week we'll have to pull it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| All right, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| Okay, let's do the roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1071)|

| 0:20:13| Have a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1213)|

| 0:20:17| Our people would elect their member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| We would be there as counsel, separate and apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| We're always there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| But we don't have a say in anything as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| So they were requesting that they be represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1226)|

| 0:21:49| year, that what the school board voted on had to bring it back again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1309)|

| 0:21:56| Okay, I was just going to make sure you knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1320)|

| 0:22:22| The Broad resident that joined us this past fall is a woman by the name of Christy Hendler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1342)|
| 0:22:29| and she has a Master's in Business Administration and had many years of experience as, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| a product line manager in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| She has what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1357)|

| 0:22:40| Experience as a product line director or manager in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1360)|

| 0:22:50| No, not fresh out of college, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| She did not have educational experience, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| That's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| $119,000, almost $120,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| What is that person going to do for this program that your current administrators couldn't do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| Was this part of the deal that you had to hire them because Gates told you you had to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1391)|
| 0:23:18| No, I don't have any conversation with Mr. Gates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| No, what Ms. Hendler brings is a particular skill set in things like project management and analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1402)|
| 0:23:31| and the ability to help look at data and help define strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1411)|
| 0:23:38| She's been very instrumental in a variety of different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| She's helped our operational areas look at key performance indicators, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| She is actually helping to facilitate the conversation right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| around our comprehensive student assessment inventory and analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| so helping us to really look at the testing that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| and to make sure that all of the testing that we do of our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| is either required by the state or federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| or valuable and necessary from the perspective of our teachers to inform instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| So she's been able to do some good work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| All jobs that current administrators could be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1453)|
| 0:24:21| I'm sorry, is that a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| All those jobs current administrators could be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| But yet we're starting somebody out here at $120,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| Where do you go from there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| What happened to all of the people coming out of college at $50,000 and $60,000 a year, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| To start with, you know, I'd like to start it at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| When I came out of college, but I didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| I went to the school of hard knocks and had to come up the hard way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| This is one place I see where that's blowing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1492)|
| 0:24:59| Unless you had some requirement that you had to pay this person $120,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| to be able to get this $800,000 grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| I'm sorry, and again, Ms. Hendler is not straight out of college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| Ms. Hendler has many years of experience in the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| where she's been a manager and a leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| And so those are some skill sets and some strengths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| that she can bring to the table in the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| What kind of private sector business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| I can certainly provide you with her resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| Well, you know, again, we're bringing somebody in $120,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| that's never worked with a school system before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| And, you know, you can say, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| if you can manage this, you can manage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| You've got to know what you're managing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| And if this is going to be the first year of learning experience for this person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| then we're double going in the hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| These things like this really concern me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| So Commissioner, we have about 8,000 employees in the Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| and this is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| And we look for a mix of different skill sets and abilities and strengths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| to be able to do the work that we do effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| And Ms. Hendler brings a certain skill set to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| that we thought would be valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| I would like to know next week what her background is, if you wouldn't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| Sure. I can provide you a copy of her resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| We need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| All right. We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| How many no's do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| I guess a point of order on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| And this is to the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| Are we entering dangerous grounds here in voting no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| If we get enough, now what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| I just think this might be a bad practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| Officially we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| It's a consent item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| It's an educational consent item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| This particular grant is a matching grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| which is an exclusion in the consent under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| Okay. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| So it's separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| I need a no votes to raise their hand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| Bussler and Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| I pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| Randy was up, wasn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| Randy's passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| Oh, you pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Randy's passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| What's the count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| What have you got to vote on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| A or nay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| I'm not voting in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1644)|
| 0:27:30| Motion passes 7-3-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| So I guess a question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| So any, the consent degree, could you maybe just give us a little thumbnail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| You don't have to do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| Just maybe an email with a thumbnail sketch on what we can vote up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| What type of things we can vote up or down from the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| Sam, let me put it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| The way I see it, and I could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| Mr. Royal Director, you can correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| But you're correct in the fact that 99.9% of the time we can't tell them what to do with their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1686)|
| 0:28:14| But a no vote is a perfunctory vote that says I don't agree with what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| So hopefully next time you'll take a little closer look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| Basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| Alright, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Alright, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1710)|
| 0:28:40| Page 15, Resolution 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| It's approving Amendment No. 2 to the grant contract in the amount of $4,250,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| with the State of Tennessee for the Knox County Regional Forensic Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| which amendment adjusts line items in the scope of services budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| and extends the contract period by six months to December 31, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| There are motions to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| Commissioner Brown, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Is this just extending our payment to the State by six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| It's extending the date of the grant so we can have project close out and get fully reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1756)|
| 0:29:23| We've received 98% of the money from the State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| It's just amending the date of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| First off, let me say I've had some personal experience with them the last couple months with my sister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| They do a fantastic, fabulous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| And Ms. Durenka, Dr. Durenka, call me herself, with the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1779)|
| 0:29:47| And maybe we haven't been in operation long enough to get a good, clear picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| but Chris, my memory serves me correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1792)|
| 0:29:59| Other counties were supposed to be paying us for their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| Are we tracking that on a separate basis so that we kind of know how we're doing there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| John Watt, who heads up our ME's office from an administrative standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| they are tracking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| And once we've been in the facility a year and get everything going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| then we'll be able to better analyze revenues from other counties across the State that are using us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1823)|
| 0:30:31| I know that was the original intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| There's a few counties already under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| Anderson and a few others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| And a few more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| So there's already some of that repayment coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| But John's done a great job of, as it came in, it was difficult to manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| And so John's a great addition over there and doing a good job over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1848)|
| 0:30:57| We need a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1858)|

| 0:31:42| We have a motion and a second to move that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| Discussion regarding the process for filling the Tennessee House of Representatives vacancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| for the 14th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| Well, I wanted to obviously put this out before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| I hadn't heard yet whether the Elections Office had gotten the writ today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| but it was supposed to be received, I believe, today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| But I had not heard whether we have or not received that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| But because of the short time period, I've been pretty much the proponent from day one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| of not appointing somebody for the interim position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| And most of the Tennessee House of Representatives that I have spoken to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| said that we should appoint somebody for the interim period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| However, now that the timetable is a little bit closer to the election process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1961)|
| 0:32:48| I think the opinion is that if something should happen to where the governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1968)|
| 0:32:55| calls a special session, we would still have 14 days to be able to appoint somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| to represent us in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| So I just wanted to put it on the agenda to see if anybody else wanted to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| Or just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| I'm in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| And maybe, I'm not saying it will be, but maybe the race will be decided in the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| There may or may not be a Democrat in the race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| And if there is, if it's decided in the primary, you can assume appointing after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| and be done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| But my opinion is that the time is so compacted, I don't know that there's a reason for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| Commissioner Brantley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| I agree with you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| I don't see any reason to move forward at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| If we've got 14 days, we can call an emergency meeting in five days and appoint somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| And the staff in Nashville is taking care of any kind of issues that might come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| so people can always rely on myself and Mr. Ownby, who covers part of his district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| plus our at-large commissioners, as well as our friends in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| The mayor has written, has announced the election of the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Wednesday, August 12th is the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| Tuesday, the 29th is the general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| Qualifying deadline for the petitions will be July 2nd at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| You immediately can pick up a qualifying petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| So we'll know more after July 2nd, and then we'll know exactly what's going before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| If we're all in agreement to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| Yes, Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| The only point I want to make, I'm in agreement as well, is that if we appoint someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| we're basically giving someone free life insurance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| Not anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| If you're appointed, that no longer applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| As of July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| Last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| If you're appointed to a partial term, it's no longer applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| Because that was my concern also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Is there a line item of transfers or a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| A motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| We are adjourned from work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| So it's 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| In five minutes, we will meet to have public forum on the ordinance, the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| that we're about to have public forum on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| So is there anybody here for that zoning public ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| We'll call it into session in five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| Go ahead and open the public forum for the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2132)|
| 0:35:39| So we'll go ahead and call this into session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| I don't know that there's anybody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| But the discussion regarding ordinance 015-5-101 to admit Knox County Code Appendix A, Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| Article III, Sections 35.51.01 through 35.51.05 to change requirements related to off-street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| parking layout, construction and maintenance ordinance 06-7-101, adopted 8-2806, and ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2159)|
| 0:36:09| 12-9-102, adopted 10-22-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| Is there anybody here to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Well, I was hoping Mr. Kelly would come up and give us a 20-minute dissertation on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| background of this ordinance so that we were fully informed on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| Oh, Jack, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| But seeing that he doesn't seem to want to get out of his chair, that maybe we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| dispense with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| Mr. Law Director, have we done our duty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| You've got a public forum, a public meeting, and the public has an opportunity to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2197)|
| 0:36:43| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| You gave them specific notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| That's all that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| I just wonder, like I said before, if we're all going to get discounts on smart cars so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| we can open the doors when we park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| If there's no public here, we'll go ahead and call this meeting adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150615?start=2219)|
