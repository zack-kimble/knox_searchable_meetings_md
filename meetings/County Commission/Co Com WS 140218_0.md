| 0:00:26| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=26)|
| 0:00:29| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=29)|
| 0:00:49| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=49)|

| 0:01:05| consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=65)|
| 0:01:08| It's easier to tell you what's not on consent than what is on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=68)|

| 0:01:31| And item 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| And then item number 9, which was, it'll be deferred until the next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=92)|
| 0:01:39| They got some issues on the legal, the law department's asked for a 30-day deferral on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=99)|
| 0:01:44| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=104)|
| 0:01:45| And so item number 9 will be deferred for, although it's on education, it'll be deferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=105)|
| 0:01:51| for 30 days, or next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=111)|

| 0:07:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| I am D.H. Andy Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| I live at 712 Summit Lake Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| I am here today as a private citizen seeking to advise you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| inform you of an opportunity to solve a problem that has bothered Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| for as long as I have been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| My comments today, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| are completely in support of a position that County Mayor Burchett has taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| and has made known throughout the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| As we say in the resolution, it deals with House Bill 2371.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=479)|
| 0:08:06| It is an unusually unambiguous piece of legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| The best way I can brief you on the bill is to just walk you through the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| I do believe you have copies of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| But basically, the first whereas mentions in four parts that there are four ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| in which annexation can occur in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| The first is known as forced annexation, and it provides a citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| It is a nonconsensual means of annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| The second, known as consensual annexation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| incites the same section of law but the rest of the paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| The item third is known as annexation by referendum, and it gives that citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| The fourth is annexation by referendum initiated by interested parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| and identifies the section of the law that pertains there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| The second whereas makes note of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| that Tennessee is one of only three states in the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| in which citizens are denied the right to vote if threatened with forced annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=552)|
| 0:09:19| It moves on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| It makes note of the fact that this bill abolishes forced annexation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| but does not in any way modify state laws authorizing the other three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| i.e., the consensual methods of annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| How does it go about doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| Well, Section 1, again, is unusually unambiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| This law will be known as the End of Forced Annexation in Tennessee Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| Amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| Now, how does it go about doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| I invite your attention to Section 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| Tennessee Code annotated so-and-so is amended by deleting the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| and it gives a line and a half that is to be deleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| It is the section of the law by which cities have the privilege of annexing citizens against their will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=607)|
| 0:10:17| Section 3 and Section 4 very simply clean up some language that was inserted last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=617)|
| 0:10:23| associated with the moratorium that has been the subject of some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| Section 5 just simply says that it will take effect upon enactment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| Folks, that is one of the most simple, straightforward, badly needed pieces of legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| we have had in Tennessee in the 20 years that I have been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| I'm prepared to answer questions on the bill to the extent that I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| but I call on this commission to send a strong message to Nashville that we support this bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=648)|
| 0:10:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| Thank you, Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Thank you, Andy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Commissioner Bowles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| I don't have any questions for the speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| I'm sorry, I was calling on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| Is Mark Donaldson here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| Hey, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| Could you come down and talk a little bit, please, about the urban growth boundary and how that works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=677)|
| 0:11:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| Mark Donaldson, Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| The urban growth boundary is part of a set of policies put in place through the adoption of the Urban Growth Policy Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=694)|
| 0:11:47| adopted in Knox County and the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut back in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| The state act requires that each county have in place a growth policy document that divides the county into three areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=713)|
| 0:12:04| one being called the urban growth area, a second called a planned growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| and the third being the remainder of the county as a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| In Knox County, the area of the county of approximately 500 square miles is broken into roughly 30% urban growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=736)|
| 0:12:27| 30% planned growth area, and 40% rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| It is within the urban growth boundary or area that the city is enabled to annex properties involuntarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=753)|
| 0:12:44| So that 30% area was described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| It was very contentious back in 2000 and 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| It went to an arbiter to finally settle on that boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| And in 2001, all of the parties came together to agree on that particular part of the geography of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=779)|
| 0:13:09| It does include many residential areas that are outside the city now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| And for a period of time, there was a memorandum of agreement put in place between the city and the county not to annex even those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=795)|
| 0:13:25| I think that period was for seven years from 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| So that agreement expired in approximately 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| So theoretically, those areas are on the table as far as the State Growth Policy Act is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=814)|
| 0:13:42| Excuse me a minute, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| JJ, can you stay just a minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| I'm going to have a question or two for you on this annexation, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| Excuse me, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| Outside of the urban growth area, property can be annexed into the city but only voluntarily through a vote of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=830)|
| 0:13:59| So we have those provisions in place now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| And so there is public input during that setting of the urban growth boundary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| It was a very long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| The county mayor and the two city mayors created a task force to guide that input process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=854)|
| 0:14:23| MPC staff provided support to that task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| And it took on the order of two years of public input before it was settled and an appearance before an impartial judge to hammer out the final details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=869)|
| 0:14:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| So there's been public input into this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| We have the urban growth boundary that's set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| The city is not allowed to involuntarily annex outside that boundary, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| That's my understanding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| So I feel like there has been public process for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=899)|
| 0:15:07| There was obviously a very long and involved process for setting the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| The city is not allowed to annex outside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| And I'm sure the city is aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| So I feel like this is simply a solution in search of a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=920)|
| 0:15:27| I think that what we have in place works and will continue to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| And if you live within an urban growth boundary, there has been public process and an opportunity for input in delineating those boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=932)|
| 0:15:48| So I don't think anyone who lives within those boundaries would be necessarily surprised about annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=948)|
| 0:15:58| So I think the boundaries are set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| I think it's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| And I think this is a solution in search of a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| So I'm sorry, but I don't agree with this, and I'll be opposing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=965)|
| 0:16:14| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| JJ, I don't want to hold you up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| You were heading out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| Yeah, there's a motion to approve in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| JJ, can you sort of explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| I know what area I used to cover in the Fountain City area up on Mountain Crest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| You had a house, and you went six or seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| Do you have the same problem in West Knoxville with law enforcement as to whose responsibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| And Brad can probably tell you that, too, because there's some finger annexes that are out in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| that is a long way for the city police department to go to to get to those areas that are county annexed or city annexed areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1003)|
| 0:16:51| Yeah, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| It creates a problem, no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| Andy, anything else you wanted to say on this from what Mr. Donaldson said or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1015)|
| 0:17:10| I would just add that this is a state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1030)|
| 0:17:20| This is a bill to propose the amendment of the state law dealing with a problem that has become increasingly painful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1040)|
| 0:17:30| and contentious across the state as an indication of the uniformity, the universal support that it has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1050)|
| 0:17:39| I invite your attention that House Bill 2371 has 60 co-sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1059)|
| 0:17:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| David, I know you've worked quite heavily in annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| Anything you want to comment on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| No, I think it's already been commented on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| J.J. talked about the problem with finger annexations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| And so far as the county is concerned, even within the urban growth boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| the tendency is to go pick off retail establishments so that the site is taxed, is taken away from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| Other than that, it's a policy decision for this commission in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| Mark, he talks about the urban growth boundary there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| If I live in that urban growth boundary, have I been notified by mail that I live in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| I don't think that's been sent out to the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| They do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| I mean, there's been maps in the newspaper, but not everybody takes the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Since adopting the policy in 2001, the policy hasn't been back in the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1118)|
| 0:18:46| We have not amended any of the boundaries since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| That's what I'm getting at, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| People don't know what area they live in as far as the boundaries there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| The bottom line for this is you're given the right to vote if you want to be annexed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| It's a property rights issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| You know, as I look at this issue, I think we've already had the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1153)|
| 0:19:20| And so while I understand people's resistance for being annexed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1160)|
| 0:19:29| I think during this urban growth boundary process, long two-year process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1169)|
| 0:19:36| that's kind of when we had this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| So, yeah, I don't think anyone's well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| Some people may be in favor of finger annexing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| but it's like we talk about annexing and then you go to finger annexing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| That's a subset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| I think what this boundary has said, these areas are up for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1191)|
| 0:20:02| There's always going to be a do I live in Powell, do I live in Carnes, do I live in Pound City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| do I live in the halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Those are always issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| I understand police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| I understand garbage pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| These are, you know, services we just have to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| It's difficult in finger annexing, but if it's a responsible process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| which we really haven't done in the last decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| So, again, we're not talking about anything that's been done around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| That's because it's been in a moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| It has not been in a moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| There has not been since 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| There's not been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| They just haven't done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| That moratorium was over in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| This is 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| So they haven't done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| So I agree with Commissioner Broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| This is a solution in search of something that hadn't even been voiced as an issue or a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1250)|
| 0:20:57| It was an issue with one city mayor a long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| and then you have one South Knoxville finger annex, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| That's all you've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| So if this passes at the house, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| But for us, a community that is dealing with it, that has dealt with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| and done a good job of dealing with it, I don't see where this resolution is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| And I've thought a lot about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| You know, again, I'm not pro-annexing, but I'm not anti-annexing either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| I mean, there's some times and some ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| You know, I sat on KUB's board for a considerable amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| and they have the right to take property via eminent domain, but they don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| They don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| We know what our culture is here in East Tennessee, here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| We're pro-property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| We don't spend a lot of time doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| You know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| With KCDC, they can, but they don't, because we value our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| and we value the process, and this thing has gone through the process, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| And so I'm voting against this because I think we've already done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| We've already identified our areas, and I think we can move on or not move on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| like we've not done since 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| Mr. Michels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| I should know this exactly, but I don't because state laws has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| I don't know exactly the reason behind the one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| I think it was a one-vote deal, wasn't it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| at the Lowes, at Chapman Highway, and John Sevier Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| But many of these finger annexations were for they were requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1354)|
| 0:22:41| and whether I'm not judging on the validity of they were right or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| or the validity of alcohol or not, but they were for liquor by the drinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| and liquor stores, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| Didn't that law change a few years ago to about liquor by the drink in an unincorporated area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| I think Commissioner Smith spearheaded that effort, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| So that those finger annexations that became law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1383)|
| 0:23:10| became part of Knoxville because of to facilitate liquor is a moot point, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| That's about six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Is that just liquor by the drink?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| Is that liquor store also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| Can a liquor store go in the halls and what's not incorporated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| I know they have them in Ferio, but it can't go in halls or cars, can it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| I just wanted to clarify that because that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| and I can see how hard it is to go down Kingston Pike or the interstate for the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| But those were those for what, you know, for some specific need, which is no longer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| I didn't know this would be as controversial as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| If there's no problem, if we're a property rights county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| and there's no problem with annexation right now, then this question is moot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| so it would be okay for the state legislature to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| If there's no problem, Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| then there's no problem with this particular piece of legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| But I really have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| And let me give one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| That would be Millertown off the interstate of 640 was a finger annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1451)|
| 0:24:20| And it has slowed people up getting into the county ever since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| because the county wouldn't come back and maintain the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| There is now an excellent redevelopment of Millertown to the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1468)|
| 0:24:37| The problem is it's still just a one-lane road out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| It's extremely wide, but it's still just a one-lane through traffic leaving town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1481)|
| 0:24:48| The reason that it didn't work is because the city has no interest in the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| that are living on further out Millertown Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| The suggestion that we've had the conversation in 2000, 2001, or 2000, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1499)|
| 0:25:06| or it's not been in effect since 2008, those are all good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1506)|
| 0:25:13| Those were fully fleshed out discussions as a result of problems that were occurring before 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1513)|
| 0:25:23| Does that mean we can't now have another discussion in 2014 about annexation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| before it becomes a problem in search of an answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| And then the last thing that really is a county resident supporting primarily rural county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1535)|
| 0:25:46| not inside the city of Knoxville people, although I do have sections inside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1546)|
| 0:25:54| The problem that I have with annexation, it's all based around the fact that the city, some opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1554)|
| 0:26:02| can't continue to maintain what they're providing with what they currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| In other words, it's a question of sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| As more and more people congregate outside the city, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| I can see people maybe wanting to be inside the city, and there would only be a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1575)|
| 0:26:21| One would be fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| Another would be law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| Other than that, most of the primary needs of county residents, and I'm saying county residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1586)|
| 0:26:35| those are the ones that live also inside the city of Knoxville, have to support on their own anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1595)|
| 0:26:45| So if this is an issue that has not become an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| and there are still means of annexation other than being forced to be annexed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| then I think I'll support the state legislature on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| Commissioner Brules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| Well, first, I'd like to take exception to the statement that the city doesn't care about people living out on Millitown Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1626)|
| 0:27:15| That's also within my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| And I don't share that assertion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1638)|
| 0:27:26| And I actually feel exactly the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| If this is not a problem, not been a problem, there is no need to enact this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1649)|
| 0:27:36| We've had, and I'm like Sam, I'm not pro-annexation, I'm not anti-annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| Urban areas do need a way to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| However, I am very much pro-process, and we've had a good process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| It's in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| It's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| And there's just no need for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| And I was going to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| I vehemently disagree with you, Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| because the city just finished a really nice road project that opened up what was a bottleneck into the Gibbs community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1685)|
| 0:28:15| That gets through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| That gets through the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| I mean, it's mine as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| It's how I get to the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| I mean, they just finished that Love's Creek area, and that was a very difficult project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| And so I don't think that area has been forsaken or forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| I think it's just slower to develop than it did in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1713)|
| 0:28:41| And, you know, I'll say that the urban growth process was an East Tennessee process, was a Knox County process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1721)|
| 0:28:51| What we're saying, we want the folks from Nashville, who we talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| we don't want those folks from Nashville telling us what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| We're letting a bunch of people from West, Middle Tennessee, and a few from here tell us what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| Like I say, if we want to change this, if we want this, then I would like for it to be homegrown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| I would like for us to form another committee, and let's talk about whether we want this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| whether we want to shrink the growth boundaries or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| I don't want the state telling us what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| That kills me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| It's like we spend a lot of time here, and I listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| Keep them out of our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| Keep them out of our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| Until it's pro-me, we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| It's kind of in for a penny, in for a pound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| And so I just think that we had a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| It was a good process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| I don't think anyone's argued over the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| They can argue over the boundaries, but the process was solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| If we want to go through that again, let's fund another MPC process, and we'll take another look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1790)|
| 0:29:57| That's the route I would be in favor of, to let our neighborhood, the people that we appoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| we can appoint a panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| Each commissioner gets a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| They can, you know, review this thing again, have more open forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| But just to have the state come down and slam a gavel down and say no more, I just don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1810)|
| 0:30:18| So that's, you know, again, this isn't about Gibbs or about Halls or about, you know, bluegrass communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1818)|
| 0:30:27| This, to me, is about doing the responsible thing in terms of just not destroying everything that we've done with one vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1827)|
| 0:30:37| one Nashville vote, and we're going to say, yeah, go, because a lot more will probably come with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| Go ahead and let Andy speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| Well, nobody's asking him a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| Yeah, I think he's used his time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| No, he still had some time left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| Less than 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| Do you have anything else that you'd like to add, Mr. Andrew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| It's been interesting listening to the discussion about process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| and what's happened here or there, which can go on to another discussion of whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| or not the annexing municipality has lived up to its plan of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| That, I suggest, is a situation for another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| But I would ask you to recognize this is a very basic issue with regard to the fundamentals of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1878)|
| 0:31:26| Here in the United States, in which the fundamental rights and sovereignty is with the citizens, recognize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1886)|
| 0:31:35| as mentioned in our Declaration of Independence, we institute governments to protect our rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1895)|
| 0:31:45| Legitimate governments derive their just power from the consent of the governed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1905)|
| 0:31:52| Forced annexation is repugnant to the spirit of our Declaration of Independence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1912)|
| 0:31:59| Now, a lot of conversations, side conversations and so on, this has nothing whatsoever to do with the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1919)|
| 0:32:07| This is entirely an issue between the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| Point of order, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| Again, unless we vote to extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| I'm fine to vote to extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| But if we start giving folks additional time, we --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| I was going to limit him to one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| I was just looking at the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| You've got about 30 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| One of the first things I heard here was members of the county commission wringing their hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1951)|
| 0:32:38| saying we don't like this issue of forced annexation, but there's nothing we can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| Today, you do have an opportunity to do something about it by letting our Tennessee legislative delegation know where you stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1962)|
| 0:32:51| that you believe in the citizens' right to vote as necessary in defense against forced annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1971)|
| 0:32:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| And that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| All we're doing, commissioners, is letting Nashville know where we stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| It's if I'm a property owner, do I get to say yes or no if I want to be annexed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| And this urban growth boundary, there's not 3% of Knox County that knows where they live as far as urban growth boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| Real estate agents don't come in here when they're showing a home, oh, by the way, you're in this urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2000)|
| 0:33:27| It's a property rights issue, giving you as a homeowner the right if you want to be annexed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| Pure and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| Nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2028)|
| 0:33:56| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| Page 12, item number 35, consideration of an ordinance of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| amending Knox County Code, Chapter 2, Sections 2-286, 2-771, and 2-783,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2048)|
| 0:34:17| to add language relative to an employer's right to speak openly and freely regarding any issue involving Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| its agencies, boards, or its elected or appointed officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| so long as such speech does not violate the laws of slander or libel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| Ordinance number 0-02-7-101, adopted August 26, 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| And ordinance number 0-11-7-102, adopted August 22, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| This is ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| I have one question, Commissioner Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| It references the old ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| Is that the old?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| Are these the new ordinance numbers or are we changing an ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| I'm going to let our law director address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| There are several sections that have limitations that are being amended with this new ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2112)|
| 0:35:21| So the two old ordinances are sections within this where revisions will be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2121)|
| 0:35:28| when we're referring to our employees and indemnification and freedom of speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2128)|
| 0:35:37| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| So I'm going to use Commissioner Burrell's words against this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| I don't see where there's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| I think this is an ordinance waiting on a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| Yeah, this doesn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| Now I'll turn to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| I mean, are our ordinances, laws, and things, do they promote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| or are they indifferent as far as employee rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| or are they pretty compliant with every other municipality like this, like the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2173)|
| 0:36:24| Well, number one, where we sit, we are in compliance with the minimum standards available under the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2184)|
| 0:36:33| I want to defer at this point in time to my chief deputy, David Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2193)|
| 0:36:43| You need a raise, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| Sorry, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Sit down, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Dave Boock, who has worked extensively on this for Commissioner Broyles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| I think between the two of them there's a lot of nuances as to what is trying to be achieved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2214)|
| 0:37:01| And I don't want to muddy it up for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| so I'm going to let David Boock comment on the particularities, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| Sorry, Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| Commissioners, Commissioner Broyles called me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| and asked me if we had in the Knox County ordinances any policy guaranteeing the right of free speech to employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2234)|
| 0:37:23| and the right not to be retaliated against or demoted or fired for exercising those rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2243)|
| 0:37:30| In fact, we did not at that time, and still don't until something's passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| have that specific policy within the policies of Knox County and its employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2254)|
| 0:37:41| What there is and what I tried to do for Commissioner Broyles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| and the commission was outline up front in the whereas provisions the freedom of speech that is guaranteed by the First Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2264)|
| 0:37:56| and the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| and the Constitution of the State of Tennessee and cited some case law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| However, as I did, for instance, I referenced Pickering v. Board of Education, United States Supreme Court case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2286)|
| 0:38:15| That case did not guarantee the absolute right of free speech with regard to public employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2295)|
| 0:38:23| In that case, the Board of Education, they said if it was a matter of public concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2303)|
| 0:38:31| which I would consider most everything to do with education public concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| then that employee did not need to fear retaliation, demotion, or firing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| However, if you read all the cases that come after that, there are things, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| a teacher who commented upon the curriculum in a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2326)|
| 0:38:52| It was held that that was not a freedom of speech issue, and her termination was upheld by the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2332)|
| 0:39:00| So it's kind of vague in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| It overall says that employees do have the right of free speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| The way I got it from Commissioner Broyles is she felt that that was just an absolute essential right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2346)|
| 0:39:13| that employees had to make free speech absent libel or slander or the other things that are in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| And to that extent, that's why I drafted this because there is no policy presently in effect in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2360)|
| 0:39:28| that says employees don't have to fear retaliation, demotion, or firing for exercising their rights of free speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2368)|
| 0:39:37| And that is the genesis of what's before you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2377)|
| 0:39:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| You know, I guess as I look at this, it's, you know, I think it's one of those basic rights that we get when we're born here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2385)|
| 0:39:53| in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| I don't see where this language needs to be added to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| In fact, I think our latest process that the school board's gone through and we heard last month says that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2398)|
| 0:40:05| our folks don't they feel a right that they can come up and say, yes, boss or boss's boss, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2405)|
| 0:40:13| I don't like what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| And to my knowledge, there hadn't been any firings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| There's probably not going to be any firings as a result of someone standing up here in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| So because, again, we have a region where we respect people's rights and people's rights to express themselves, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2422)|
| 0:40:33| save going to a libel or a slanderous state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| And it's, you know, there's been some things out there that probably has crossed over that in this last conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2438)|
| 0:40:47| And I still don't think anything's been done that's been derogatory toward that person or those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2447)|
| 0:40:55| So, again, I don't see where the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| I don't see where we've demonstrated a propensity to come down heavy handed on any of our employees within Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2460)|
| 0:41:13| So I just don't think this ordinance is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| I've actually looked over this and spoken to some citizens that's called me that actually looks at our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2482)|
| 0:41:30| And, yeah, there is some out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| The only question that I have really is this with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| Our ordinance, I don't believe, will cover school system and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2501)|
| 0:41:49| OK, as long as it will, then I'm fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| I just don't want us passing something that only covers a small section of our people that work for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2511)|
| 0:41:59| So as long as it will cover the school system and any other departments out there, then I'm fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| You know, I think that all of us believe that people have the right of freedom of the speech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2526)|
| 0:42:12| and can say in practice and all what they want to a large degree, but there should be limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2532)|
| 0:42:20| You know, Tennessee is an at-will employer state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| And to think that someone could start to say in an office or in a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| or somewhere else could talk in a very repugnant manner, a very offensive manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| using very offensive language about people due to their race, their ethnic background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| their religion, or their sexual orientation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| and the county would absolutely have no recourse on a person who just will not stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2564)|
| 0:42:51| And that is exercising your right to say what you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| But also, I think an employer has that right also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| If this is totally repugnant to him and what we represent in the language is to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| if you're going to talk like that, you can't work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| And every business, for every business that you work at, to the best of my knowledge, it's an at-will employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2587)|
| 0:43:15| And I think the county needs to run like businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| I don't think anybody will be retaliated against for coming up and speaking their mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| although it's very contentious and controversial subjects that we've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| particularly the school board issues last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| But I support this and appreciate Commissioner Brawls bringing it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| One of the things that when I brought this to David Buch and asked him to work on this for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| two things in particular I wanted to make sure were covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| One was that it did cover all departments and elected offices within the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2632)|
| 0:44:00| and also that it did not protect employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| There's the part in there about slander and libel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| and this does not mean that you can go out and call your boss names and expect to keep your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2648)|
| 0:44:15| It does not protect against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| One of the reasons that I thought that this was a good time to bring this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| is not just because of what we're seeing happening with teachers speaking out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| who are, some of them, genuinely, rightly or wrongly, concerned about retaliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2668)|
| 0:44:36| I personally don't anticipate that happening whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2676)|
| 0:44:43| Also, it's an election year where we have some offices up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| and I've heard from employees within the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| who have wanted to campaign for or against particular candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| and are afraid to do so because they are afraid that if their candidate of choice were to lose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| then they would lose their job, or I suppose the other way around as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2703)|
| 0:45:10| So this isn't just about what's happening in the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| This is also about what's happening this year, an election year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| and making sure that our employees know that they have the right to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| that their speech is protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| And we do have this right under the First Amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| but right now that has to go through federal court, which is a lengthy and expensive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| This brings it down to the local level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| and we talk about not wanting to be governed by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| We don't want them making our decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| Same thing with, you know, we don't want unfunded mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| We don't want the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| We are home rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| And this is exactly, actually, I think the opposite of what Commissioner McKenzie was saying earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2754)|
| 0:46:03| is that this is our local government taking local action to protect our local employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2763)|
| 0:46:11| This is not depending on the federal government or the state government to protect our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| We are stepping up and doing it ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| And one final thing is that, you know, Mayor Burchett was quoted in the paper as supporting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| so I hope none of you will miss the opportunity to vote for something that he and I are both in favor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2784)|
| 0:46:32| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| I think this, according to our law director, our deputy law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2796)|
| 0:46:44| it's an example of something that reinforces the idea of free speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2804)|
| 0:46:54| And because it's come about mainly over the teacher issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| and the willingness of those teachers to come forward and speak their mind about what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2820)|
| 0:47:07| the reality is, and as teachers well know and have experienced throughout their careers, retribution occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2827)|
| 0:47:17| And there's a variety of ways to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| Those individuals that have been most active in this latest discussion about school policy, evaluation and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2841)|
| 0:47:32| they thoroughly, I mean, many of them come to me and say, well, we know it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2852)|
| 0:47:40| And so they just expect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| If the evaluation system continues to go as it is in place right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| it's a very simple thing really to affect those evaluations just on the basis of some communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2871)|
| 0:48:02| however that communication is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| And so because of that, I mean, I'm just, I think it's something that certainly doesn't hurt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2885)|
| 0:48:12| and it might help teachers and might help their position, might help them to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| it might give them some level of comfort at least about what's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2897)|
| 0:48:24| And they certainly should feel free to enter into this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| They're the ones that are the most affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| And they should have that right to speak their piece without fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| And so I think this might help them do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| So I'll be in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| Deputy Dave Rutt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| If I had just known that when I retired from AT&T, I would have went to law school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| We have been successful today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| We've taken not a bag of marshmallows, but just one marshmallow, and we've made a mountain out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2936)|
| 0:49:04| Now I don't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| As we look at it from Commissioner Norman's point of view just then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| this is to protect some people who may face retribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| Really, and who can vote against that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| The thing, though, that Commissioner Broyles brought out was where I thought this was headed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| and it's in the political arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| This is the era of elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| And I would be of the opinion that if I worked in one of the elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| if I worked for the sheriff and I went out and worked for someone other than the sheriff, I'd expect to be fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2977)|
| 0:49:45| So let me use a different example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| I work in an office for an elected official, and I've been a poor performer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2987)|
| 0:49:53| and I think I'm going to be fired, so I go out and I run my mouth, and then I'm protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=2993)|
| 0:50:02| I don't know which is going to come first here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| If we have on the books now adequate protection, then I would agree with Commissioner McKenzie to leave the books alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3006)|
| 0:50:19| If the law director would tell me that it does not really change what we have, it just maybe reinforces it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3019)|
| 0:50:33| and it's not the law director, it's my nemesis, my namesake that's going to comfort me at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3033)|
| 0:50:41| Mr. Booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| At the present time, it is not policy in Knox County to say that it's illegal or you can't retaliate or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3044)|
| 0:50:56| There is nothing on the books other than, as Commissioner Boyle said, a long, involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| and expensive lawsuit in federal court under the Civil Rights Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| The problem with that is if you have a boss, a head of a department or whatever, that retaliates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3067)|
| 0:51:16| and that person goes to federal court and wins, not only is Knox County saddled with the expense of defending that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3076)|
| 0:51:25| if it's defensible, but also must pay the attorney's fees of the employee who was wrongfully fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3085)|
| 0:51:34| In these lawsuits, 1983 lawsuits, $100,000 plus attorney's fees having to be paid by the government are not at all unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3094)|
| 0:51:45| They're the rule rather than the exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| So it puts Knox County at risk to not have some teeth to the policy of freedom of speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3108)|
| 0:51:58| And you will note in here, and that's one of the things Commissioner Boyle has asked me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| how do we put teeth in it other than just say this is our policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| So if you will note in one of the three amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| and these are amendments being pasted into and added to the existing three existing ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3130)|
| 0:52:17| you will see that Knox County is not under any duty to indemnify a party, a boss, the head of a department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3137)|
| 0:52:27| or whoever fires somebody or retaliates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| Now, putting that in the same context, if that person wrongfully fired, terminated, demoted an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3152)|
| 0:52:40| and they win in federal court, that $100,000 that the county would have under this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3160)|
| 0:52:48| would not have to indemnify that person in that department that wrongfully fired somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| That's the teeth that go into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| They don't get to be indemnified for that damages plus the $100,000 plus attorney's fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3177)|
| 0:53:04| So that's, to answer your question, it's not satisfactorily on the books at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3184)|
| 0:53:13| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| Dave, does that also go for the fee offices too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| Yes, because what happens on those, it goes across the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| because if and we've in the past the county's had a fee office issue, which we were able to put the fire out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3203)|
| 0:53:31| But we were looking at that exact issue on a fee office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| So, yes, it applies everywhere across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| Commissioner Norman or Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| Or neither one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| You know, hearing that last little bit, yeah, I'm moving, I'm sliding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3229)|
| 0:53:58| I mean, if it is something that will allow us not to indemnify, defend someone who's obviously been a bad actor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3238)|
| 0:54:10| then I don't see where this is going to change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3250)|
| 0:54:17| I think our folks are ready and able.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3257)|
| 0:54:23| I don't see anything coming from an evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| People have been evaluated and not liked their evaluations since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| This is new to teachers, and it's something you get really nervous about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| I've been getting nervous about it for 25 years, and it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| But I don't see any kind of retribution coming from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| However, this is far reaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| It's a lot further reaching than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| I thought it was primarily directed there at the present issue that we have with teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| So I'll be in favor of this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| Yeah, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| I still have difficulty with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| And I guess part of the problem is, is if you have to deal with the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| and civil service employees, there's not a whole lot of motivation necessarily to do things well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3303)|
| 0:55:10| because it's generally a job for life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| I could almost see more problems that when you do try to get rid of a problem employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| I guess if you have all the proper documentation and paperwork you can do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| but then all of a sudden they're claiming that this is retribution against something that I've said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3323)|
| 0:55:29| rather than for legitimate reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| and you end up with even a larger legal morass than what you'd have under what we have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| because we don't have a problem, as best we can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| I mean, we haven't seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| I mean, every time somebody gets a transfer that they don't like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| every time something happens that they don't like, they can claim freedom of speech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| or my rights have been violated and, you know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| It just seems like we could potentially be creating more problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| since we don't seem to have a problem right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| All right, we have a motion and a second on the floor for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| Before we go any further, on our agenda we failed to enter the line-item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| You're not voting on the line-item transfers, but I need a motion to add them to next week's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| So I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| You got a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| All right, they'll be added and you can read them over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| They just weren't on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| On page 13, item number 38, is discussion regarding the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| We'll move that to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| Commissioner Brown's not here, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| We can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| That's not an action item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| We can move it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| Anybody would go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| Joint education, does anybody want to talk about the retreat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| Anybody have any comments, questions about the retreat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| I was out of turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| Item number 40, discussion regarding the CTAS County Official Certificate Training Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| Educational Incentive Payment received by Barry Hawkins while employed by the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| Commissioner Rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| Some days ago, at the pointing out of my staff, I was given leave of looking at an article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3445)|
| 0:57:36| It was in the New Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| And it was a relatively short article that contained information that I had previously been aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3459)|
| 0:57:47| saying that a former employee of Knox County had received a $3,000 payment to which they were not entitled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3467)|
| 0:57:58| I picked up the phone and called the law director, called him at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3478)|
| 0:58:06| and asked him if there was something that the sitting commission should do about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3486)|
| 0:58:13| And I believe that basically was my question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| is there a need of action from the point of view of county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| And as I eagerly await, I have not discussed it with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| since that initial after five o'clock request a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3506)|
| 0:58:34| Yeah, give me an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| Is there something that we sitting commission should do about this $3,000 bonus paid to someone who was otherwise not entitled to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3516)|
| 0:58:46| Well, factually, I don't know whether there's anything that you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3526)|
| 0:58:53| I believe that the person in question had left employment before they were ordered or whatever to repay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3533)|
| 0:59:05| That would be more of a fact of law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| and I think it would be more up to the trustee's office if they did anything than it would be county commission, truthfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3547)|
| 0:59:15| And basically, whenever I asked the question, I should have given the law director's response at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3555)|
| 0:59:25| He said, I read the same article with interest, but I don't know where we stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| That's the reason I had left the question with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| So based on the answer that he's given us right now, I withdraw this discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3572)|
| 0:59:39| We have somebody that signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| Do you want to speak to the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| Barry Hawkins, if you'll give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| My name is Barry Hawkins, and I live at 3325 Lansin Lane in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3587)|
| 0:59:53| My name is Barry Hawkins, and I am running for Knox County trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| Although I was not given a formal notice of this meeting by the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| I've come here today to clear my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| This so-called discussion is all the earmarks of a political witch hunt that smells of backroom politics by my opponent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| I am surprised at the time of this discussion with it being scheduled so close to the upcoming election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3610)|
| 1:00:16| and more than a year after the conclusion of the investigation by the appropriate officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| To me, the discussion should have been held at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| Now it looks like an attempt by Commissioner Dave Rott trying to intimidate a candidate running for election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3625)|
| 1:00:31| and abusing the power of commission to help a friend and or colleague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| CTAS is designed as an educational program that has been in place for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| I was encouraged to participate in CTAS by my superiors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| While under the previous administration, payment was received before completion of the accredited hours of CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3644)|
| 1:00:50| After receiving payment, I questioned the trustee about the CTAS payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| and he assured me that it was new office policy and procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| Still with concerns about the payment, I spoke with my office manager and chief of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| They reaffirmed that it was office policy and procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| I was in the process of completing my CTAS designation when and soon after my job was eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3667)|
| 1:01:14| Since then, I have spoken with the appropriate officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| and the result of my discussion with these officials is that I followed office policy and procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| and did everything I was instructed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| I had done nothing wrong, and I don't appreciate any accusations otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| The entire focus of my campaign has been to efficiently operate the Knox County Trustee's Office and reduce staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3690)|
| 1:01:36| In doing so, we can save millions of dollars that can be used by the Knox County General Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| and applied to our schools, our teachers, and our law enforcement agencies in our senior program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| These are the people who are responsible for our children's education and the protection of our family and our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3706)|
| 1:01:53| God bless, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| I don't want to talk about this specifically, but I guess I want to restate my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3718)|
| 1:02:06| I think these discussion items can take a life of their own if we're not careful, and unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3726)|
| 1:02:17| I mean, to me, I don't care what the new Sentinel did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| but I wouldn't put a person's name on our agenda when we're discussing something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| But that's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| I wouldn't use a word like revolt, but that's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| So am I right or am I wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| No, but I do think we need to have a standard to say what I can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| and maybe I should be more inflammatory, controversial, specific, whatever words you want to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3758)|
| 1:02:47| I just think these discussions, and I know it's hard on you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| I know it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| I know you want to give us a voice, but I really think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3772)|
| 1:02:59| I honestly don't think Commissioner Wright had any ill will at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| But when you put a name there, as Commissioner Brown says, we get a little more prime time than the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| People kind of look at our stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| They view our, I know I laughed earlier, but they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| So I think we need to be careful when we're putting these discussion items out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3798)|
| 1:03:27| I think the other ones kind of get vetted by the law department, probably get toned down some, if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3807)|
| 1:03:33| They do our wishes, but Commissioner Burroughs' ordinance could have been phrased a little more flamboyant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3813)|
| 1:03:42| But I think the law department understands what they need to do to say, hey, this is what we're trying to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3822)|
| 1:03:48| But these discussion items are kind of our own creation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| So I'll just voice my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| All it is is concern, but I don't think this is a good way to get items out there in the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3835)|
| 1:04:03| I agree with you, Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| but I don't know that the chairman has the leeway to change the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| Just a quick question, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| I don't know if the gentleman left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| Who told him it was okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| Was it the trustee at the time or his supervisor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| You know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| All I was doing was reading the Knoxville News Sentinel about a person that received $3,000 to which he was otherwise not entitled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3861)|
| 1:04:30| I ask, is there something that county commission should do about it because it was $3,000 that left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3870)|
| 1:04:38| Now, what took place in the former trustee's office, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3878)|
| 1:04:46| But we do know, you can hear it from me, this is not political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| I have heard this person speak in several club settings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| and have not challenged him about any of his campaign promises, I'll put them that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3896)|
| 1:05:03| because that's what he gets to make is campaign promises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| But to say that I had a political agenda when I'm a seated commissioner looking after the $3,000 of Knox County taxpayers' money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3907)|
| 1:05:18| and having received the advice of our lawyer that there was nothing really that we needed to do about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3918)|
| 1:05:29| I guess I could say my feelings are hurt by what he said, but then I'm the seated commissioner and I have no feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3929)|
| 1:05:38| I'm here to ask what the people of 8th District want us to do, for me to carry here, for us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3938)|
| 1:05:46| and then for us to act accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| And the politics can take place at all the other settings where they need to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| Item number 45 is discussion regarding county zoning maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| Mr. Brewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| Mark, you're up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| Apparently, this is an issue that's taking place in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3972)|
| 1:06:18| and I've asked David Buch to start looking into this for me, so hopefully we will have ‑‑ it's going to require some research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3978)|
| 1:06:27| Hopefully we'll have more information next Monday, and along with more information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3987)|
| 1:06:35| a better idea of any action that we as a commission need to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| Apparently, sometime 20 to 30 years ago, the county commission, or whatever it was called at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4000)|
| 1:06:50| changed the zoning definitions, and jump in and correct me if I say anything wrong, Mark, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4010)|
| 1:06:58| Between RA and RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4018)|
| 1:07:04| And my understanding is that the reason behind that was to go make it more ‑‑ make it more ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4024)|
| 1:07:12| make more sense to go from less dense to more dense as you go down the zoning designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4032)|
| 1:07:21| So where RA used to be residential apartment or multifamily, and RB was single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4041)|
| 1:07:29| the commission at that time flipped those definitions so that RA became single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4049)|
| 1:07:37| and RB became apartment or multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| Am I getting this right so far, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| With the exception of the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| I'm doing pretty good then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| I'm on a roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| So apparently the commission at the time did this, but no changes were made to the maps at the time reflecting those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4071)|
| 1:07:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| I love to hear you giggle, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| But so now we're running into a problem about a development that is trying to go up in ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4084)|
| 1:08:16| within my district in a RB zone that really, according to the residents in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4096)|
| 1:08:27| should not go there because truly it is ‑‑ should be zoned RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| But because the maps were never changed, it's created some ambiguity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| So at this point, if I've confused you enough, I'm going to turn it over and let Mark take it from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4118)|
| 1:08:46| Thank you, Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| You are so welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| So we have this basic nomenclature of RA and RB zoning in the Knox County Zoning Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| with as currently enacted, RA is the low density residential zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4135)|
| 1:09:02| and RB is called general rezoning and allows, by right, without any further review by planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4142)|
| 1:09:12| or anybody else other than permitting the development of apartments up to 12 units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4152)|
| 1:09:20| It, in fact, according to the records that I've been able to see, dates back to the early 60s when that change was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4160)|
| 1:09:31| The 25 year ago date was a time when the planning commission did a zoning study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4171)|
| 1:09:39| and made a formal request to the county commissioner to change the zoning map for more than 500 acres along Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4179)|
| 1:09:51| both sides, south side and north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| That occurred in 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| According to the records, the minutes from the planning commission meeting make reference to the early 60s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4198)|
| 1:10:05| as being the date when the RA and the RB were switched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| And there was fairly vigorous debate at the planning commission on the pros and cons of changing the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4208)|
| 1:10:17| The planning commission recommended changing the zoning map so that the areas that are currently RB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4217)|
| 1:10:24| would become either RA or AG, and the county commission tabled that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4224)|
| 1:10:32| And as far as I know, it's probably still sitting on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4232)|
| 1:10:39| But the area along Tazewell Pike, it may be the most concentrated area of RB zoning in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4239)|
| 1:10:49| but RB zoning is throughout the county, and there are subdivisions built out in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4249)|
| 1:10:57| There's raw land with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| I think the last time I brought it to the attention of the commission as needing to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| was probably when we adopted the east county sector plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| That was one of our tickler items of things to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| So back in 88, there actually was a formal application made by the planning commission to change the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| and it was put on the table by the sitting county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4282)|
| 1:11:31| Okay, so what do we need to do to fix this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4291)|
| 1:11:38| The county commission has the authority to initiate a general rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4298)|
| 1:11:44| The planning commission, as exhibited back in 1988, has that authority as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4304)|
| 1:11:50| We're a little gun-shy about marching off without specific instructions from the legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4310)|
| 1:11:58| for fear of doing a lot of work and not getting any results from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4318)|
| 1:12:04| But so much time has expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| If, in fact, it was like 1963 or the early 60s that these were flipped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| there have been a lot of decisions made about RA and RB zoning since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4333)|
| 1:12:19| There's been our normal rhythm of changing zoning maps to and from RA and RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4339)|
| 1:12:27| Land has been purchased based on the expectations of having the zoning that appears on the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4347)|
| 1:12:36| Entire subdivisions have been built out in land that is zoned RB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| and who knows what kind of deed restrictions or whatever exist in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| So whatever we do, it needs to be fairly strategic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| And keep in mind the growth policy plan that exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4371)|
| 1:12:58| A lot of this area along Tazewell Pike is, in fact, in the urban growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4378)|
| 1:13:05| and perhaps some of it warrants a more aggressive zone district than the RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4385)|
| 1:13:14| But we have tools to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| And if we are strategic about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| we can probably go a long way towards fixing some of the more egregious errors that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4399)|
| 1:13:29| Is the acreage we're speaking of right now the 26-acre zone by Neyland something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| And, in fact, in our minutes from the 88 meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| the family that owned that particular land at that time spoke in favor of keeping the RB zoning in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4420)|
| 1:13:49| on behalf of the family and surrounding property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| So can I ask you to please work with the law department to come up with a solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| a strategic solution to bring to the commission so that we can fix this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4438)|
| 1:14:06| Yes, we are at your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| I've also made a formal request to codes to please not issue any building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4449)|
| 1:14:22| And within the boundaries of my district until this has been resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4462)|
| 1:14:29| So I just wanted to put that out there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| I wouldn't think that would be legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| Well, I have no authority, but I can certainly make the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| And so I have respectfully requested that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| Whether or not codes wants to go along with it or not is totally up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| But on behalf of my constituents, I have made that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| Dr. DeVandivate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| Commissioner Broyles, we have received and discussed your request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| and conferred with Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Buch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| And I would have to be on the record with this body to simply say that any legal applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| that meets all the zoning requirements and permit conditions that are presently on the books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4513)|
| 1:15:18| will be granted a permit as they ordinarily would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| I understand completely, but it was necessary for me to make that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| And I did check it with the law department first, who also told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| you can ask, but they don't have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| Commissioner Broyles, this is a discussion item, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4538)|
| 1:15:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| Okay, we're just discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| I believe I remember some R.A., R.B. discussions within the last year or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4547)|
| 1:15:53| in downtown historic Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| We had some R.A.s and R.B.s that we were trying to get into the new zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4558)|
| 1:16:06| What was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| Commercial, rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| Rural and neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| So this is and that's not the we've had it a couple, three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4575)|
| 1:16:22| The large overlay of Corrington is really small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4582)|
| 1:16:30| And the discussion of how do you fix that now puzzles me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| I mean, you and I are in the same boat, because what we're looking at today's desires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4595)|
| 1:16:44| I want to see nothing more dense in Corrington than maybe three houses to an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| But when you go to that old zoning in downtown Corrington or the rural, excuse me, the urban area of Corrington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4610)|
| 1:16:59| the lots are not they're probably five or so lots to an acre maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4619)|
| 1:17:05| You know, we're just now in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| So really what I want to hear is more of how do we flesh out the fact that we have laws that were placed on the books in the 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4627)|
| 1:17:17| That's 1960s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| And how do we get to where we want to be here in the 2020s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| And I assume that's what he says he's here to service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| And that's, you know, obviously this is not I don't anticipate this to be an entirely easy process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4651)|
| 1:17:39| I mean, this predates my birth, frankly, when this first change was made was before I was even born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4659)|
| 1:17:47| So there's a lot of research that needs to be done and a lot of discussion that will need to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4667)|
| 1:17:55| But I'm comfortable asking the law department and Mark Donaldson to get together on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4675)|
| 1:18:03| and advise us on what steps we need to take, because this is a problem and we do need to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4683)|
| 1:18:11| And thinking of the fix where we have property ownership and small little parcels and small houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4691)|
| 1:18:20| And, again, I return to Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| And we're sitting and looking at Ontaswa Pike where you've received calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| and I've received dozens of calls also, even a few e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4707)|
| 1:18:36| That is an acreage piece of property now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4716)|
| 1:18:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| So are we looking at trying to find a fix not for this piece of property that is currently going to draw permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4724)|
| 1:18:51| and get themselves into a growth mode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| Are we talking about acreage pieces of property that have this zoning overlay on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| and how do we fix that to make it look like today's zoning would be if it were an ag zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4740)|
| 1:19:07| And then what would it move to in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| I wouldn't be surprised if a strategy would not entail kind of all of the above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4752)|
| 1:19:19| I'd literally take a look at all of the land that's zoned RB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| and make a very quick cut as to which parts of those had already been developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4764)|
| 1:19:30| versus which land is still raw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4770)|
| 1:19:36| And then compare it to the existing land use plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| and compare it to surrounding zonings in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| and come up with a fairly fine-toothed approach to fixing the zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4784)|
| 1:19:52| almost on a parcel-by-parcel basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| And I think we would have to look at all of the sectors that are primarily outside of the city limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4795)|
| 1:20:05| and make sure that we're inclusive of all of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| and take it wherever it leads us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| But we've got tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| We can amend the zoning ordinance if that shows up to be a fairly easy fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4816)|
| 1:20:24| We can create new zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| We can flip to the planned residential zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| which gives people flexibility and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4830)|
| 1:20:36| I need to make one last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| What I do not want to do, I mean, try to ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| I can't phrase it any other way except be negative, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| I do not want to change things where people have invested $1,150,000 into something which would cause the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4847)|
| 1:20:56| because they could not develop what they have underway, the land not be worth $1,150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4856)|
| 1:21:04| We can't go against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| And the press release that's been given by that particular organization toward that development is saying high-end apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4867)|
| 1:21:14| And when I call the people back that are addressing this particular development, say, oh, high-end apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4874)|
| 1:21:22| this is high-end condo living and $300,000 homes that are out at Tazewell Pike there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4882)|
| 1:21:31| The general comment has been, oh, well, high-end apartments will fit in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4891)|
| 1:21:36| That's the response I received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| But I think there's something that needs to be fixed because there were other questions that were asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4898)|
| 1:21:44| that were really off the wall from high-end apartment dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4904)|
| 1:21:51| So we need to get somewhere on raw land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| and we also have to consider where we're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| It's like, for example, small lots in Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4917)|
| 1:22:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| Discussion regarding amusement tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| Chris Caldwell is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4934)|
| 1:22:15| Who is on the arena committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| Sam, are you going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| My cam and also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| Are you going Thursday night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| I have another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| Commissioners and Mr. Chairman, I'll let you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| You're prerogative here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| Some quick history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| The Thompson Bowl Arena was started in the bond issue, I think it was 1982,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4950)|
| 1:22:38| and it was a 20-year situation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| And we're still charging amusement tax after that has even been paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4961)|
| 1:22:48| Could we get the mayor has been spoken on this, Brad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| he was on talk radio talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| Can he address this to us on Chairman's Luncheon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| Do we have time for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| He can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| But there's more than just the arena on amusement tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| You know, we're still collecting amusement tax on every ticket sold in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| And also, Nayland Stadium charges amusement tax, and they built it back on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| You know, there's a lot that goes into a football game, a basketball game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| and they talk about the amusement tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| And we'll have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| But there's a lot of policemen and a lot of city service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| There's a lot of traffic engineering that goes into the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| that the city puts into that, and also the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| And we put things into those days to make those days go off without a hitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| And so there's a tradeoff there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| And so it's not just a one-sided discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| But, yes, we'll have that at Chairman's Luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| You got something on that amusement tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| Okay, just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| I just have two quick announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| One, I'm having an open meeting at the Time Warp Tea Room Thursday at 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5032)|
| 1:23:59| We will be discussing items on the agenda and a NACo legislative conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5039)|
| 1:24:06| For anyone who would like to come, you're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| It would be great to see you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| And I'm also going to be adding two items on next week's agenda as discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5052)|
| 1:24:18| that also we may be discussing at the Time Warp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5058)|
| 1:24:24| And one is the progress being made on the Sheriff's Department's salary survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5064)|
| 1:24:30| and the other being compensation of our public works employees during inclement weather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5070)|
| 1:24:38| when they are required to come in and work and the remainder of the county employees are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5078)|
| 1:24:43| So I'm planning to add those as discussion items next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| And I will be talking more about that Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| Commissioner, do you have anything to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| Any other items for the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140218?start=5096)|
