| 0:00:30| of Knoxville-Knox County Planning and I wanted to share a few updates with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=30)|
| 0:00:36| all today. So virtual meetings as most of you are aware Governor Lee has extended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=36)|
| 0:00:42| the virtual meeting option until the end of the year. So planning staff will host| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=42)|
| 0:00:46| all of our public meetings virtually through the end of this month and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=46)|
| 0:00:49| the majority of our meetings will continue to be held virtually through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=49)|
| 0:00:53| the end of the year. The majority of the executive committee did are in favor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=53)|
| 0:00:58| meeting in person next month if the plexiglass that PVA has told me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=58)|
| 0:01:06| they are installing in the large assembly room if that does get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=66)|
| 0:01:09| installed. So I will keep you all updated on the progress of that and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=69)|
| 0:01:13| that looks like. So we've had a couple staff changes so I wanted to announce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=73)|
| 0:01:18| those to you all or share them with you. So we recently promoted Allie Ketron. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=78)|
| 0:01:23| know you all don't see her very often but you probably receive a lot of emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=83)|
| 0:01:27| and hopefully have noticed over the last several years that you know she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=87)|
| 0:01:33| really made some significant strides in helping us improve our communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| in some of our outreach efforts with the community. So she's always looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| new ways to engage and and better ways to communicate and we really do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| appreciate that and she really challenges us all to you know to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| the next step in that regard. So she'll be taking on more of a leadership role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| with our information services group over the next year. And Andrea Kepfer, she has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=115)|
| 0:02:00| taken on some additional responsibilities as our interim customer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| service coordinator. This is especially important to me in my interim role to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| have someone assisting in overseeing the day-to-day operations of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| customer service function of our agency within planning services. So this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| really the the public facing portion of our agency. So she will be working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=139)|
| 0:02:25| that team to make sure that that we're continuing to provide a high level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| customer service especially as we continue moving forward with our digital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| submission process. There's a lot of changes internally that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| happening but she'll be doing this in addition to her addressing duty. So we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| really pleased to be able to have have these staff on board and and all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=160)|
| 0:02:46| work that they contribute to the agency. And speaking of Allie, so I hope that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| all saw an email recently from her from some new communication tools. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| Korbelik was asking about the timing of when comments get posted. So this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| directly relates to that. So you know our staff as I mentioned is always striving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| to make sure that it's easy for community members to sign up to speak at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| meetings, submit comments to commissioners, and that they have direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| contact to staff with any questions or concerns, comments that they have. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| staff has updated the speaking request process that allows community members to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| participate in monthly planning commission meetings. Previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| individuals could request to speak at a meeting by calling or emailing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| commission email or staff which they can continue to do but now due to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| frequency and the volume of emails that we've been getting on a monthly basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| we've created an online form to make it much easier for them to sign up and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| the process easier in general on both ends so on our end and their end as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| In addition individuals can now fill out an online form to contact us, contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=230)|
| 0:03:58| staff to submit comments. These direct go directly to you all utilizing these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| forms. So right now they come into your email. There is a brief delay. It can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=243)|
| 0:04:09| anywhere from an hour to sometimes up to 24 hours depending on when they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| So this is a more a quick a quicker way for those comments to get to you all and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| get posted to our website. So the forms like I said are in addition to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| typical means of communication with us so which are the email addresses and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| contact numbers that we have. So the John Sevier Highway Corridor study you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| have heard me announce that that that project has picked back up and just as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=274)|
| 0:04:41| reminder there was a study that was adopted last year in 2019 and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| stakeholder committee was established to guide that effort. So after having to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| cancel a meeting earlier this year due to COVID we did meet to be a Zoom last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=289)|
| 0:04:55| month on October 21st and at this meeting they reviewed some key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| priorities such as considering a road safety audit, adopting an overlay for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| that corridor, and encouraging community-led beautification efforts. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| stakeholder was really supportive of moving forward with this process and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| they actually want us to move as quickly as possible of course. So next steps were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| outlined and it focused on staff completing a draft overlay zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| ordinance within the next two to three months probably more on the on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| three-month end of things and this draft will be presented back to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| stakeholder committee for consideration and review and then we'll have workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| with with the Planning Commission as well as Knox County Commission probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| in the spring and the committee hopes to have a final draft for adoption as soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| as possible so we're looking at probably late spring early summer to start that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| and to get that into the legislative process. If you weren't able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| to watch that meeting have an interest in doing so there is a recording of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| meeting on the Planning YouTube channel and if you have any trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| getting to that you know please contact me or Liz Albertson she's the lead staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| on that project and she'd be happy to send you a link. So beginning later this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| month staff is also beginning to review the South Waterfront Code so this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| within the city in South Knoxville so we'll be looking at the South Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| Code and process. This is something we've been tasked to do by city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| administration and the South Waterfront Form Code hasn't undergone a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| significant review or evaluation since it was adopted so this will over a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| decade old so staff is in the process of developing the project timeline and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| we anticipate scheduling one-on-one interviews in coordination with city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| staff over the next month or two. We'll be developing a community survey within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| the next few weeks and really the aim of this initial part of the process is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| for us to learn more about the process and what is working and what is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| working and kind of get a better idea of where this review will go in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=411)|
| 0:06:57| future. Institutional sign standards. So last Tuesday I presented a timeline for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| staff to develop a new set of sign standards specifically for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| institutional district in the city zoning ordinance. I gave them an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| estimated time frame of beginning this month and getting us into April of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| next year so you all might remember you reviewed some draft changes to some sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| standards and there was a request for us to consider you know developing sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| standards specifically for institutional district so we're going to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| on that. The first step will be reviewing and analyzing really any variances that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| have come in that that might apply to that district as well as looking at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| of the suggestions that have already been submitted by community members such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| as St. Knoxville Hospitals and others and we will prepare a new draft set of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| standards in December probably early January and we'll have review and input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| by city staff. We'll solicit input from key stakeholders, institutional district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| partners as well as St. Knoxville and then we'll revise that draft on based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| that stakeholder input. Then we'll solicit community input. We'll post these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| standards to our website. We'll provide ample opportunity for additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| community input. At that we're gonna have to reassess if we'll have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| type of public meeting or maybe we have a zoom or have one-on-one meetings we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| just have to play it by ear given the current situation with COVID and so once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| we have that input we'll summarize those community comments and post them to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| website and then we'll finalize those draft standards sometime late January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| early February and so you all can expect to have this place on your your agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| in March so that's the aim that's our goal is to get this to City Council and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=521)|

| 0:22:58| Yeah, is this any better? A little bit. Okay. Somebody, if we all could mute ourselves. I'm gonna keep testing the sound. Let me know. I don't hear a TV. Is this okay, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1378)|
| 0:23:26| Sounds a little muffled, but I'm just trying to speak as loud as possible. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1406)|
| 0:23:35| So this is the existing land use for this area. This is what the utilities, the sewer and wastewater look like in this general area. I would imagine that the sewer is probably already out in this general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1415)|
| 0:23:50| This is what the slope analysis looks like. Again, we got a recommended density of 1.934 units per acre with this slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1430)|
| 0:24:12| The total dwelling units that they could get with our recommended density is... Sorry, Amy. Yeah, it's just that you're fading out again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1452)|
| 0:24:32| Is that any better? Can you hear? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| So this is the slope analysis for this area. Again, we see that there are some post-submerged top protection areas on the site. However, the actual steepness of the slope is not super steep compared to some of the surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1477)|
| 0:25:01| And yeah, so our recommendation is for rural residential because it's in the rural area that they're policy planning. And our recommended density for them is 1.93. Are there any questions about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1501)|
| 0:25:20| This is Eddie Smith, Mr. Chairman. And this is not a question on this one, but it's more just kind of a long term, something we probably need to start looking at it just at least on these reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1520)|
| 0:25:31| I'm looking at the estimated student yield of 83, knowing this area and how dense the schools already are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1531)|
| 0:25:38| Can we start getting a report on here of like what the percentage of available space at each of the schools in some of these tight areas are? Because that's going to start affecting the school system, you know, long term as we're looking at some of these areas where some severe development is taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1538)|
| 0:25:57| Amy, do you want to respond to Commissioner Smith? I think that's, this has been an ongoing discussion about, you know, how these numbers are used. And I think that might be something important for us to touch on at our retreat, give you all an overview of how these numbers are generated and then how they're used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1557)|
| 0:26:18| And then we can talk about potentially, you know, what some opportunities might be moving forward, you know, to encourage better coordination with the school district. But, well noted. I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1578)|
| 0:26:34| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| Yes. Liz, could you say something more about the body of water that's showing up on this particular property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1596)|
| 0:26:47| Yes. So, the pond on the property, it appears to be dammed. It, I believe, was a sort of previous, you know, pond that was put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1607)|
| 0:27:04| It's my understanding that probably when they come through the use and review process, they're going to incorporate this pond into part of their overall site plan for the community as an amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1624)|
| 0:27:17| You know, this is naturally fed in as a tributary of Hickory Creek. So, that's the extent of my knowledge about this, but it does appear to be created by a dam structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1637)|
| 0:27:41| Commissioner Corbett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| Yes. Thank you. I have a lot of concern about the status of this road. We have been approving a fair amount of development, not all of which has manifested it so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1667)|
| 0:28:01| But, I took a look at the Northwest Sector Plan, and there are some detailed solutions under the North Campbell Station Road. I had a little trouble, just myself, trying to locate this project on that map. It's on page 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1681)|
| 0:28:24| But, it seems to me that the two options for straightening out the road, one of them at least, would cut through this proposed application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1704)|
| 0:28:35| And, I was hoping the staff would address that situation. Are we going to, in approving this development, not be able to improve North Campbell Road overall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1715)|
| 0:28:48| It is a very windy road. It's very narrow. It's just not a safe road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1728)|
| 0:28:56| I'm going to let Jim Snowden, if he's available and willing to speak to this, and any improvements on the horizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1736)|
| 0:29:13| Yeah, Amy, this is Jim Snowden. Can you hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| Yes, we can. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| Yes, Commissioner Korblick, I appreciate your question. We do have some money allocated in the current fiscal year budget to do some analysis on Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1758)|
| 0:29:30| And, in doing so, we've kind of identified that to be a project that's both, in conversations with the Town of Farragut, actually a project that we would both like to do as part of the Transportation Improvement Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1770)|
| 0:29:44| So, we, in combination with Town of Farragut, have submitted an application for the Mobility Plan 2045 that's currently being put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1784)|
| 0:29:54| We feel like the project has regional significance as it relates to not only the county, but the town and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1794)|
| 0:30:02| So, we think the appropriate course of action will be to gather federal funds for that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| We've looked at a couple of real early alignments, kind of 30,000 foot view, and we're kind of skirting the west property edge of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1807)|
| 0:30:17| So, at least, kind of what we're thinking, our, I guess, preferred alignment based on that would be slightly to the west of this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1817)|
| 0:30:27| But, we're actually trying to secure some federal money to start that process in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1827)|
| 0:30:34| And, realistically, I know a little bit about getting federal funds through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1834)|
| 0:30:43| It will take probably two decades to get it really sorted out completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| And, so my general question is, what do we do in the meantime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| Right now, Ms. Korbelick, we don't have any specific plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| We did do some, we had a project out there last summer and did some slope stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| But, as far as the current capacity and crash history, or crash statistics on the roadway, we're not seeing anything that would spur us to do a more short term type project at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1863)|
| 0:31:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Any other questions or comments on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Seeing none, move on to Waterloo construction, 11I20RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1891)|
| 0:31:39| This one is also a request to Northwest County for a low density residential and planned residential request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| This is Liz Albertson's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| What number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| Sorry, it's not number 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| It feels like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| So, this is, yes, off of Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| How's my audio now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| I've been trying to adjust it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| It's better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| It's better, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| This is the northeast side of Coward Mill, east of Pulaski Parkway, east side of Redhorn Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1944)|
| 0:32:31| It is adjacent to a residential subdivision that is currently under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1951)|
| 0:32:39| And this area is generally transitioning from large lot agricultural and rural residential to single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1959)|
| 0:32:50| This is the subdivision I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| You can see it on the zoning map here, density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| What they received back in 2017 was 2.3, 4.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| However, recent numbers have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| I'm sorry, Liz, I can't understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| You're mumbling to my old ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| You're just mumbling, and I apologize for that, but I would like to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| Is this better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| So, this is adjacent to a planned residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| It's also adjacent to the forthcoming elementary school that has been planned for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| There's also an extension from the Cherahala Boulevard that is supposed to come through this general area to connect over to Horseshoe Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2013)|
| 0:33:42| The applicant is requested to go from planned residential up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2022)|
| 0:33:50| This will likely be within the parental responsibility zone for the forthcoming elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2030)|
| 0:33:57| So, sidewalks would be considered at the time of use on review for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2037)|
| 0:34:04| And if they were to rezone up to five dwelling units an acre, the maximum density they could be allowed would be up to 27 dwelling units in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2044)|
| 0:34:17| A transportation impact study may be required to be submitted as part of that forthcoming use on review concept plan for development of this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2057)|
| 0:34:27| This is what the sector plan looks like for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| It's currently showing up as Technology Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| And again, they are requesting to go to low-density residential to consider this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2074)|
| 0:34:42| This is what the existing land use looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| It has not been updated in this area to indicate the new adjacent single-family residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2085)|
| 0:34:57| So, keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| Staff is recommending PR up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| It's consistent with the plan amendment for LBR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| And it also does not appear to be in conflict with the existing development, forthcoming development that's occurring in this general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2111)|
| 0:35:23| And again, we are considering up to five dwelling units because of the proximity to the forthcoming elementary school, as well as it will be in the parental responsibility zone for that elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2123)|
| 0:35:37| And it is an area that is transitioning to that, those types of low-density residential uses, more so than the Technology Park land use classification that's been designated in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2137)|
| 0:35:56| This is what sewer and water looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Again, it has likely not been updated to demonstrate that sewer is coming up to serve the adjacent subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2158)|
| 0:36:07| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| Mr. Korbelik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| Just another concern about the road network here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| I was looking at Coward Mill Road, my notes, I drove out to it the other day, and I wrote in my notes, I said, this is a really bad road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2178)|
| 0:36:27| It's winding, narrow, and there's a rumble strip in the center line because of the narrowness of the lanes and the curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2187)|
| 0:36:37| And I was looking at Coward Mill Road, and I said, this is a really bad road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2197)|
| 0:36:47| And I was looking at Coward Mill Road, and I said, this is a really bad road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| I will let Knox County sort of speak to the existing conditions of Coward Mill, as well as when Cherahalla Boulevard would be extended through this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2213)|
| 0:37:15| Yeah, thanks, Liz. This is Jim Snowden again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| Yeah, Commissioner Korbelik, appreciate the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| We actually have a joint project that Knox County Engineering is funding half, and the Knoxville School System is funding the other half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2241)|
| 0:37:30| to actually widen Coward Mill from its current configuration, which is give or take 17 to 18 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| to 20 foot wide from Pellissippi Parkway all the way to the Ben Ashley Veterans Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2257)|
| 0:37:45| They're eliminating the one lane bridge. It'll be off alignment, so it'll be a brand new bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| 20 foot wide roadway throughout the entire corridor with sidewalks along the entirety of the street on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2271)|
| 0:38:00| And then in relation to Cherahalla extension, we are acquiring the last few right-of-way tracks now and would start that construction in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2280)|
| 0:38:11| And both projects are slated to be done by the time the school opens in fall of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2291)|
| 0:38:19| Perfect. And you answered my next question, is that when would it be completed? Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2299)|
| 0:38:30| Any other questions? I don't see any hands. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| The next one is item number 24. This is Patricia Nelson. This applicant is requesting a change in zoning and plan amendments from residential to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2316)|
| 0:38:48| And the staff lead is Liz Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| Yes, thank you. So this is the south side of Osborne Road. It is north of Strawberry Plains Pike intersection with I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2333)|
| 0:39:05| Osborne Road is a major collector with a pavement width of 17 and a half feet and a right-of-way of about 60 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2345)|
| 0:39:16| The area is primarily single-family residential uses and it's approximately a half mile outside of the interstate interchange for Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2356)|
| 0:39:27| Although this property is adjacent to a CA-zoned property, it's not recognized by the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2367)|
| 0:39:35| The sector plan does not support commercial zoning in this area. It shows up as low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2375)|
| 0:39:44| And because of these characteristics, staff is recommending to deny the applicant's request to general commercial for the plan amendment because it's not consistent with the surrounding development or zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2384)|
| 0:39:59| And we're also recommending to deny CA general business zoning because it's not compatible with the sector plan and it could create adverse effects for the surrounding agricultural and low-density residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2399)|
| 0:40:15| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| I don't see any hands raised. One more for Liz here. Item number 27, which is land development solutions, 11P20RZ. This application is for a comparable zoning request in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2416)|
| 0:40:38| Thank you. So this is at the Bridgewater Road area. It's a medium-divided major collector with a pavement width of 64 feet. The applicant is requesting to go from commercial to office. The property is presently zoned OP Office Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2438)|
| 0:40:57| This is what the area looks like with the FEMA flood map overlaid. It is adjacent to the 10 Mile Creek Greenway Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2457)|
| 0:41:08| There's also some medium-density residential zoning noted by the R.B. Zone District on this plan. Again, the R.B. Zone District is a county general residential zone that allows apartment buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2468)|
| 0:41:26| So there are some existing sidewalks in this area. Again, proximity to the park, medium-density residential. Staff is recommending, because this is in a city that has a wider array of different types of development districts for commercial uses, the CG Zone District, which is more pedestrian in character, is what the applicant is asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2486)|
| 0:41:57| We reached out to the applicant, and they were okay with that, even though their initial request was CH, which is a highway commercial zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2517)|
| 0:42:08| However, the primary use of this location is a reception facility, and they wanted to make sure that they were still able to use this location moving forward if they do any improvements as a reception facility, given the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2528)|
| 0:42:25| Under office park, reception facility is not allowed, so that's why they requested the rezoning. Again, we recommended CG because of the pedestrian nature of this area, and the applicant was okay with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2545)|
| 0:42:44| This is what the Sutter Plain map looks like. So you can see this going. This is not changing. It's just staying general commercial. Rezoning is the only thing that they are asking for to commercial, whether you're in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2564)|
| 0:43:02| This is what it looks like when I say it's pedestrian in character. You can see this map a little bit. There is a bus route here, and there are also sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2582)|
| 0:43:17| Liz, this is Pat. We're losing you again. You're getting some interference or feedback on your computer, I think. I'm not sure if it's your headphones or the computer, but there's getting noise in the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2597)|
| 0:43:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| I will keep working on this. I'm sorry about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| Does anybody have any questions or need for clarification of something they might not have heard clearly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2624)|
| 0:43:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| Okay. Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| All right. So now we're moving on to item number 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| This is 10D20RZ. It also requires a sector plan amendment. This is the overbee. This application was postponed last month at the request of the applicant to allow for additional time, and the lead staff on this is Michelle Portier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2643)|
| 0:44:21| Can you guys hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Okay, so this property, you guys will remember it came before you last month, and this is just going to be a refresher, so I'll kind of go through this really quickly, but I'm happy to entertain any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2666)|
| 0:44:37| This particular property has had requests for several different rezoning since 2001, one of which was for the CN zone and NC land use, similar to what or the same as what they're requesting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2677)|
| 0:44:49| We had recommended denial at the time because it wasn't consistent with the sector plan or with the area, and because the property was somewhat limited in being able to accommodate some of the CN zone requirements, and it was denied by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2689)|
| 0:45:04| For this particular property, a lot of the CN zone uses are compatible with residential uses, but there are a few that are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2704)|
| 0:45:14| For example, the NAICS 621 and 532 include some uses that wouldn't be appropriate, such as ambulatory healthcare services, emergency centers, ambulance centers, organ and blood banks, truck utility, trailer and RV leasing, and leasing of commercial industrial machinery and equipment, and those are uses we felt like weren't compatible next to the predominant single-family houses and lots in this particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2714)|
| 0:45:41| The applicant has said that they would like to introduce deed restrictions. I haven't received any as of this time. That's not something we would be able to support in our staff reports. We're bound by what the municipalities can, I guess, by what they can go after and do permitting for and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2741)|
| 0:46:06| The other thing is CN zoning is not compatible with the southwest county sector plans LDR, low density residential land use designation, and would require the plan amendment to the NC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2766)|
| 0:46:17| However, the bar is a lot higher for sector plan amendments, and it doesn't really meet any of the criteria that's set for that. So there's no recent changes to conditions, no new roads or utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2777)|
| 0:46:28| There's not a significant error or omission in the plan, and there's no new trends in development. The properties to the north across Choteau Road that have the shopping center that you can see here on the screen, those were rezoned in 2010 and developed in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2788)|
| 0:46:46| So they're not a recent trend into the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| And just briefly looking at the land use designations, it's predominantly single-family around with that commercial zoning and land use to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2810)|
| 0:47:00| But the sector plans NC designation, it's meant to be sort of just a spot here and there. It's not really meant to be a strip that develops along an arterial or a collector. And so for that reason, we didn't feel like it met the location criteria for the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2820)|
| 0:47:16| And that's it for this one, unless anyone has any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| This is Dick Graff. I don't have a question, but I do have a comment in your staff report, and you just mentioned it, that the little shopping center across the street was developed or approved in 2011, I think, and that it's been a decade since that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2840)|
| 0:47:44| The thing to remember is in 2011, right along in there, everything in construction just stopped dead in its tracks. I mean, nothing happened and projects didn't get started. They didn't get finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2864)|
| 0:48:02| So I don't think it's quite a fair comparison, because right now it's up and booming in that area, and there are a lot of changes taking place in that existing, well, I don't know how far out you want to go, but there's a lot of development going on right now, a lot of building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2882)|
| 0:48:29| So I kind of question some of the reasoning behind the recommendation to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2909)|
| 0:48:39| It's just a comment. You don't need to answer. It's just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| Commissioner Adams, had her hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| Yes, I've got a couple of questions, just in continuing to think about this and the fact that it's in front of us again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2928)|
| 0:48:55| When I look at the map, this does appear to be in the planned growth area. So I'm wondering if I'm misreading the map, but the version that was in the case file, it looked like the yellow area of planned growth was encompassing this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2935)|
| 0:49:13| You are correct. It is in the planned growth area. So we're basing the decision on the sector plan based on the fact that I don't consider it to be recent significant changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2953)|
| 0:49:24| And the fact that the NC sector plan is that neighborhood commercial designation isn't supposed to be along a strip. That's the two main criteria that I'm basing that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2964)|
| 0:49:35| Okay, I've got two other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| What type of existing buffer is there between the the edge of the property in question and the residential area that it looks like trees that we've got a few sparse trees right now as a buffer. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2978)|
| 0:49:57| Yes, that's correct. And the Knox County zoning ordinance does have a landscaping buffer requirements whenever there's residential uses adjacent to commercial and they would be required to comply with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=2997)|
| 0:50:10| I want to say it's a 20 foot depth of trees to be planted and it kind of talks about what kind of trees and how so often and how dense, it needs to be that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3010)|
| 0:50:20| I want to say it's around 20 feet on center for each tree to be planted with some sort of bushes or something in between is is the requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3020)|
| 0:50:29| Okay, that's what I was thinking. I just wanted to confirm like that scenario does not exist currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| That's correct. That would be part of the development plans. And, you know, something to think about too is, you know, when you have a restaurant that's that close to this kind of area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3035)|
| 0:50:44| You know, there's going to be a dumpster that shouldn't be along the right away. And so that kind of forces it closer to these residential homes and whoever are in these homes down here. Of course, this will probably get developed at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3044)|
| 0:50:57| Those people are going to have to hear, you know, garbage being taken out of the dumpster and things like that in the early hours of the morning, there might be some smell associated with that just kind of noise and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3057)|
| 0:51:10| Because the property so small, there's not really a lot of opportunity to mitigate those kinds of things. And that's, you know, part of why we don't feel like it's the best fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3070)|
| 0:51:18| Okay, last question. And you may have addressed this when we looked at this previously, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3078)|
| 0:51:24| Did this developer ever look at plan development, were they ever encouraged to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3084)|
| 0:51:31| We ever, we can't really require people to look at plan development. It was mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| But I, it's kind of hard for them because one of the bars, they would have to meet is providing a public benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3096)|
| 0:51:43| And for something like this. It's not really it's providing a service, but I don't know that you can make the argument that it's a public benefit of the kind we would be looking at like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3103)|
| 0:51:52| Your supportive housing or something like that. So it's kind of a hard bar for them to meet for this particular project, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3112)|
| 0:51:58| I'm Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3118)|
| 0:52:05| Oh, you made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| Yeah, I mean, now, yes. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| No, I was just gonna make the point. I'm in that area a lot. This is the far west end of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| Not far down north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| If you're ever going to have any commercial to service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| All the residential that's developing out there. This is kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| Are you going to have to do it. If I look at the 2016 historic area on KPIS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| Show no markets across the street. Nothing. There was one building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| I would kind of respect everything that's saying I just don't agree with that portion of it. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| The condos, the restaurants, they've all come since 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| And I think it's a good thing. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3166)|

| 0:53:17| That's the main thoroughfare, which is my opinion, but I just thought I'd mention it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3197)|
| 0:53:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3206)|

| 0:53:35| Is that what you're talking about there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| These condos here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3220)|

| 0:53:45| You got 20 on there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| Put 2016 on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3227)|

| 0:53:49| I mean, none of those condos are built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| The Mexican restaurant that's on the corner across the street wasn't built yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| So I would say just areas in continuing to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| All those people who live down there need some commercial services and they're just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| running out of places to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| Start right there on that corner, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3235)|

| 0:54:34| Scott kind of beat me to the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| To the punch. I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| I just don't see this piece of property ever being developed into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| something with houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| Plan development type situation. It's kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| Since there's not a very good place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| To put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| I think it really needs to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| Further request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| Just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| Thank you. Commissioner Edison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| I didn't have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| I saw your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| Commissioner Corbett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| Yes. I just wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| I feel that this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| Property is inappropriate for a single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| Almost any form of residential due to its size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| And the hub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| And the heavy use of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3330)|
| 0:55:38| I'm assuming that there's no way that it could gain access off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| They have come several times been denied each time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3348)|
| 0:55:54| I'm just talking at this point. I'm not asking a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| Restaurant is a good use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| Given the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| Impacts that interim director Brooks has mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| But there needs to be something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3363)|
| 0:56:04| And I just feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| Sorry for the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| A rezone is appropriate. Maybe not CN, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| The property needs to be more than residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| I think probably office would be a good fit at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| But they're asking for that CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| So that's what we're entertaining at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| Mr. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| I just want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| Make everybody aware. We need to be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| We're getting an almost deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| In some respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| And you're stating your opinions about how it should be zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| And really the agenda review should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| Pretty much asking questions and not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| Advocating for or against that particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| And I guess I'd like either director Brooks or Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| Wise to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| To weigh in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| No, I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| Commissioner Phillips. That's that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3428)|
| 0:57:15| Generally that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| that's been my understanding of the purpose of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| So thank you for bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| I don't know if Mr. Wise wants to weigh in, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| I concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| Okay. I don't see any other hands, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| So let's move on to agenda item number 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| Ronnie Welch 11 G 20 RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3455)|
| 0:57:44| These next two applications number 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| number 19 are for comparable zoning requests in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| So I'm just going to turn it over to Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| So looking at the map comparisons before the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| I just want to point out that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| The request that was submitted here was rezoned in 1984.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3481)|
| 0:58:10| There was a request that came before this board that was denied by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| The request was to rezone from our one to our two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| And then the applicant appealed the decision to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| I'm not sure if that was just an inaccurate statement or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| misunderstanding, but it never came to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| And these are two properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| We're still sort of an anomaly along this stretch of Greenway road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| Or Greenway drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| On this frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3511)|
| 0:58:49| And so staff stands by our original stance back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| We don't feel like conditions have really changed since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| And we still are recommending that denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| And looking at the existing land use around it's predominantly single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| family residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| with the exception of one of these parcels that's requested for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=3543)|

| 1:07:53| to the site and so their request now before you this is just to kind of show you some context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4073)|
| 1:08:00| there's that single family area and then this type of development with the larger lots goes all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| way up to Harris extends quite a ways and looking at the existing land use and future land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4084)|
| 1:08:11| again predominantly single family low density to the north and then bird's eye view this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4091)|
| 1:08:18| the development here and this is their property here they're looking at adding a parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| taking down this building along here they're not able to do that with the current zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| so with that in mind they're asking for PC for all three zone for all three parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4108)|
| 1:08:34| and that will enable this board to review that site plan and there are some considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| that would be made for access and things like that that would help mitigate some of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| that neighbors have with the existing use so the use of the property wouldn't change but it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| enable us to provide some or require some provisions like the landscaping buffer and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4129)|
| 1:08:56| where the access points are and things of that nature that could help help the neighbors have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| a little bit less of an impact now there are some with the PC zone and the office sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4142)|
| 1:09:10| designation which is the sector plan the land use that they're recommending or that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| requesting it is required that they have a restrictive covenant that sets out the specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| uses that would be allowed within the PC zone on these three parcels and this is what they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| submitted so general manufacturing bottling or packaging canneries and office and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| manufacturing compounding etc etc and then wholesale or housing and distribution enterprises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| and that would just enable them to continue operation it wouldn't introduce anything new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| into that area and so that's the restrictive covenant that they've submitted as per the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| use classification table in the PC zone as written in the zoning ordinance also the office designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4184)|
| 1:09:51| that they're asking for is less intense than what they have now they really wouldn't be required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4191)|
| 1:09:58| ask for a land use designation amendment for these two properties because they're already GC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4198)|
| 1:10:04| which allows the PC zone they're asking for the office for all three so it's a step down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| for these two and it is more consistent with what's on the property across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| and so with that I'll open it up to any questions anyone might have thank you Michelle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| Commissioner Adams thank you I drove out and looked at this entire property when it was on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4220)|
| 1:10:30| agenda previously and this is interesting to see this transition in the request my question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4230)|
| 1:10:38| about the road because how does this request still deal with the concern on of Harris because it is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4238)|
| 1:10:45| very small and twisty road well we can't add conditions to rezonings but we can and to as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4245)|
| 1:10:53| part of the site plan so that's something that we could address with there you know you would want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4253)|
| 1:10:57| your access point to be here and restrict your truck travel along this road that could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| conditions that could be introduced okay thank you any other questions comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4260)|
| 1:11:11| okay thank you Michelle then we're going to move on to item number 33 this is 11 se 20 c 11 j 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4271)|
| 1:11:22| you are searchy village this is a subdivision on fountain city road and Mike Reynolds is the lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| staff if he's available yeah there we go thank you all right um did I share my screen there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4287)|
| 1:11:39| does everybody see that yes okay good all right um so this this first case is the sturkey village| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4299)|
| 1:11:47| subdivision it's 43 lot subdivision on 18.8 acres and it's about 2.3 or 2.29 dwellings per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4307)|
| 1:11:57| like we're only seeing your your email thank you that's what I was glad you pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4317)|
| 1:12:04| let me redo this screen one there we go all right now you see my map now we're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4324)|
| 1:12:14| got it all right okay um so this is uh again so this is sturkey village um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4334)|
| 1:12:22| subdivision that's being proposed it's part of or adjacent to the other larger neighborhood that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4342)|
| 1:12:28| is called sturkey village um it's 43 single family lots um as you can see it's it's uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4348)|
| 1:12:35| has a greenway that runs through it um and I'll show you a little more detail on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| and it goes over to Tommy Schieffer Park as well as Sturkey Hills Park and beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| but the main main concern with this property and I wanted to address real quick is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| it's something that I um sent out before this meeting was a revised staff report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| and um let's kind of see what I have highlighted here uh condition number four was revised and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| then really condition number five is a new one um but condition number four talks about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4379)|
| 1:13:05| certifying the site distance on Fountain City Road where the new road a connects in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4385)|
| 1:13:12| some some preliminary reviews by Knox County showed that there might be a site distance issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| so during design plan review what this condition says is um if there is a site distance concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| looking really looking to the south um the road can be shifted slightly to the southward and I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4403)|
| 1:13:29| show you here on the map um so here so the road can be shifted slightly to the south in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4409)|
| 1:13:38| get the site distance that's required 300 feet site distance looking to the south um they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| not too far off right now we don't think um but during the design plan phase uh that will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4423)|
| 1:13:49| determined if that needs to be shifted or if it ends up being okay where it's located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| it does need to be shifted those have to adjust the road just a little bit in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| the second condition that I or the condition number five that was added is a condition to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4437)|
| 1:14:03| increase the uh radius uh horizontal radius uh and in the second curve here in road a from 105| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4443)|
| 1:14:12| to 200 uh foot radius um and and really what's happening here is so if anybody's leaving the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4452)|
| 1:14:19| site um the current design is a little sharp of a little too sharp of a turn in order to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4459)|
| 1:14:26| engineering standards with a 25 mile per hour road it really needs to be about a 200 foot radius| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4466)|
| 1:14:32| then the there's another 105 foot radius here near the intersection but really you're coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| to a stop condition so traffic should be slowing down coming into this curve and should not should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| not be an issue but that that'll be further evaluated during permitting as well I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| if engineering wants to anything to that but um that was the general um changes in regard to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4486)|
| 1:14:54| project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4494)|
| 1:15:02| that's any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| let's see any okay so we'll move on to item number 34 which is 11 sf 20 c is this clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| springs plantation the applicant is requesting a variance in removal of a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| on this previously approved subdivisions and this is also mike reynolds thank you amy um so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4518)|
| 1:15:24| this this project has a little bit of a history to it um it was originally developed or approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4524)|
| 1:15:32| it when it was in the county in knox county and then it was later annexed into the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| so it was 2005 it was approved when it was still in the county and in 2006 it was annexed by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| city so it really started off in the county but as the as the project has developed over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4541)|
| 1:15:49| they've never certified that what was installed from like a road and infrastructure condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| was was installed per the permits and so the one variance that is being requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4554)|
| 1:16:01| is actually a vertical curve variance within the existing road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| um and engineering has as far as i think to this point is is in favor of approving the variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4565)|
| 1:16:14| there's certain things that do allow a road to have a a a lesser vertical curve this one in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4574)|
| 1:16:22| this case would be a sag curve so it's actually going you're kind of going down a hill and going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| up a hill here um it like for instance street lighting is one thing that can help with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4585)|
| 1:16:31| with a sag curve like that and this this boulevard entrance does have a street lighting on it there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4591)|
| 1:16:37| also a creek that runs through here so changing this now would be problematic because of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4597)|
| 1:16:42| creek their other um portion of this is to the request is to remove the requirement of a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4602)|
| 1:16:50| a sidewalk on one side of the street for well meadow wells drive and autumn creek drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4610)|
| 1:16:57| that the sidewalks were never installed as part of the project to begin with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| there is a sidewalk on glen creek road all the way to um williams millatown pike up here yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| motown pike and there is a sidewalk that goes into um i can show you here but this um smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4629)|
| 1:17:18| development off to the to the west uh there was a recent approval for another phase of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4638)|
| 1:17:26| subdivision to the south and that does have a sidewalk in it and there's a condition of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4646)|
| 1:17:32| approval that says that the sidewalk that's installed as part of this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4652)|
| 1:17:37| needs to extend down to the glen creek traffic circle here just so that it's clear that at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4657)|
| 1:17:43| least we get that connection down to where this existing sidewalk network is does anybody have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| any questions mr phillips uh mike how does the final plat get recorded without the improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4668)|
| 1:17:59| being completed or a bond issued i believe that there's a bond held but maybe um curtis might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| able to address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4685)|
| 1:18:12| are you available i am sorry yes this this project's um got a fairly long history uh it began| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4692)|
| 1:18:24| probably 15 plus years ago and uh if i'm not mistaken may have been uh actually permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4704)|
| 1:18:32| in the county and then the city i think immediately annexed it um or at least a portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4712)|
| 1:18:38| of it but then back uh that many years ago um didn't quite have the uh the staff that we do now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4718)|
| 1:18:47| and uh the expectations of putting the sidewalk in early on the project um have since uh been i'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4727)|
| 1:18:55| say reaffirmed and and uh made more apparent uh but at that time a lot of folks uh built homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4735)|
| 1:19:03| without building the sidewalk infrastructure it it typically was bonded however um as we learned um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4743)|
| 1:19:12| it's very difficult to go back and and make corrections after the fact a lot of times even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| on fairly flat lots you end up tearing out most of a driveway up to a garage to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| um get the slopes to transition properly this area is fairly flat but based on our experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4763)|
| 1:19:31| it it still lends to quite a bit of disturbances back on private property to be able to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| work um and so because of that it would be very difficult to go in and install the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4777)|
| 1:19:44| and i will say given that the project has had the length of of uh lifespan that it has typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4784)|
| 1:19:52| um bond values uh aren't increased as uh projects get older and older and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=4792)|

| 1:23:42| and i think we've had another case like this not too long ago where there's requirements for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5022)|
| 1:23:49| sidewalks and they're clear the developer just doesn't do it and then we just say okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5029)|
| 1:23:55| and no smack on my hand or anything of that nature um i'm kind of of the opinion if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5035)|
| 1:24:02| don't do the work that was supposed to be there they should forfeit the bond that's just my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5042)|
| 1:24:13| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5053)|

| 1:25:00| stuff but we don't have a lot of enforcement ability but i think i'm just expressing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| opinion that this should be one of them i think one of the reasons you put up a bond is to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| sure you do what you're supposed to do and if you don't you gotta forfeit now whether that goes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5109)|

| 1:25:39| if we had our building inspectors looking for you know sidewalks when they're required should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5139)|
| 1:25:45| be done when the driveway's poured and that would be one way because you know years later i mean i| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5145)|
| 1:25:53| i'm not we don't know what all's happened and how seriously back when this was first a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5153)|
| 1:25:59| it was it was made but you know you keep the bond now for not putting sidewalks in you might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5159)|
| 1:26:06| have you might put the city or whoever in a position where they if they keep that bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| they've got to put sidewalks in yeah that's a good point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5170)|
| 1:26:16| steve do you know about that what would happen there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| i'm sorry answer me ask me the question again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5179)|
| 1:26:24| if they forfeited the bond on this for not putting the sidewalks in would the city in turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5184)|
| 1:26:33| be required to put the sidewalks in yeah i don't know the answer to that i wouldn't think so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| i've wondered that myself representing developers um i don't know the answer that's not the approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5198)|
| 1:26:46| i don't know the answer that's not the approach that at least the city and i'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| courteous and weigh in but their approach is if they keep the money then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5209)|
| 1:26:53| it's to be applied toward development of that portion of the project that didn't move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5213)|
| 1:26:59| but it could could be kept just merely as a penalty i had no idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5219)|
| 1:27:07| or punishment it ought it seems to me it ought to be but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| of course the uh it's code enforcement service engineering that controls that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5230)|
| 1:27:16| it's whatever policies they establish in this case the city and if curtis doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5236)|
| 1:27:23| know the answer that um we can we can find out the answer and share that with you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| if you could amy or steve that would be helpful i think for all of us i think we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5248)|

| 1:27:39| ask them to weigh in or um are you asking both for the city and the county do i need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5259)|

| 1:27:52| here in a day or so so i guess the question is who holds the bond is it the county or the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5272)|
| 1:27:59| well it depends where the project is the city owns city bonds the county's hold those property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5279)|

| 1:28:16| that it may this this bond may just be out there in limbo somewhere i'll figure that out as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5296)|

| 1:30:34| discussing now uh but but if i remember correctly i think it was mainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201110-agenda-review?start=5434)|
