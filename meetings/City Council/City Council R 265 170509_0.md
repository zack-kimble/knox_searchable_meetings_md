| 0:05:06| is coming to Magnolia Avenue on Sunday, May 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| We've had previous Open Streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| along Central Street and in Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| and they've been pretty big successes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| A lot of people have shown up for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| The street is closed to vehicular traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| for a Sunday afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| and pop-up vendors offer physical activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| like dancing or playing chess with giant pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| or street hockey, just a lot of different activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| So this time from 2 to 6 p.m. on May 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| Open Streets will be on Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| between Randolph and Chestnut Streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| with a small loop onto East Depot Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| One of this year's highlights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| will be a mile-long puppet parade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| by the Cattywampus Puppet Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| I guess we're just gonna have to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| So visit OpenStreetsKnoxville.com,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| OpenStreetsKnoxville.com for more details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| And later this week, look for a detailed map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| showing where food and activity vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| will be stationed along the route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| Finally, I wanna ask Kaye Graybeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| our MPC's Historic Preservation Planner, to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| And as she always does this time of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| she has the Annual Preservation Report to present to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| Yes, thank you, and good evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| Mayor Rojero and council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| This executive summary of activities and preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| over the last year is written into our city's charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| back in 2002 that this report would be presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| to the mayor and city council each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| So just very briefly, I wanted to go over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=403)|
| 0:06:51| what's in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| Our historic zoning commissioners last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| were Laurie Matthews as chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| Sean Boland, Bart Carey, Steve Cottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| Farrah Seed, Melissa McAdams, Sandy Swilley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| Stanton Webster, and Jason Little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| Sorry, that's not showing up well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| but some of the biggest initiatives that staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| and the commission undertook last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| were an update of Knoxville's historic resource inventory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| under which 81 properties were inventoried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| with a focus on our mid-century modern properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| those that were constructed between 1936 and 1945.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=447)|
| 0:07:37| Our historic zoning commission approved a new process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| for a pre-application review to help applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| through the process that may have larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| more complex projects, such as new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| Also, as a mayor's initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| and funded in our budget, in the city's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| is a historic preservation grant fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| that continued last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| and those winners have just been announced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| And then MPC staff completed an Edwood Park City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| historic district expansion survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| based on a resolution from council back in March of 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| asking staff to look into that potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| for an expansion in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| that would cover more of the National Register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| historic district area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| And 521 properties were surveyed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| and as you know, several meetings have been held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| in that community to discuss this potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| and how that proposal may formulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| as we roll it out to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| to find out what their support is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| Last year, the commission and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| reviewed 103 certificates of appropriateness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| usually Forth and Gill and Old Norton Knox have the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| but this year we did have a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| a lot more than usual on our individual landmarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| the houses that are, and other buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| that are individually designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| and not part of a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| So we have four properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| I just wanted to point out that our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| do have solid rehab proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| or either in progress or plans approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| and so we have some positive movement on these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| and four of them are Dover development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| As you know, Rick Dover is working on several,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=566)|

| 0:09:32| Supreme Court building, Locust and Henley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| Prior Brown parking garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| plans have been approved for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| and the Knoxville High School building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| and rehab is in progress there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| so those are all very positive movements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| for those buildings, and then we also have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| the city has, I think, put out an RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| for a proposal for roofing repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| It is a brownfield site, and a grant has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=595)|
| 0:10:03| awarded with an RFP from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| for asbestos abatement, roof structure repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| and re-roofing, and then we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| the Cal Johnson building, which was designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| in 2015, and we have plans approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| for the rehab of that, and that's owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| by Jed Corporation, and then the Kearns Bakery building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| was nominated to the National Register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| of Historic Places in 2016, and David Dewhurst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| Mark Hines, Tim Zitzman, and Dixon Greenwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| purchased this building and have completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| an exterior rehabilitation that was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| by the Historic Zoning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| and the interior space is now being marketed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| for leasing, so we do have some positive movements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| on a lot of buildings in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| So, May is Historic Preservation Month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| and Knox Heritage will be announcing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| their Fragile 15 this Monday at 11 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| at the Knoxville High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| These are just ones that I highlighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| as still being threatened, these are not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| what's on their Fragile 15 list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| but these are just a few that I've highlighted here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| I'm sorry, the Knoxville College Historic District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| we still have a ways to go on finding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| a strategy to preserve that, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| the Howard House, which is still up for sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| but doesn't have any historic protection on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| The Standard Knitting Mill, we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| any solid proposals on that complex yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| This, I'm sorry you would be unable to see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| but I did a handout from Knox Heritage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| that lists their events for Preservation Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| You can also go to Knox Heritage's website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| at www.knoxheritage.org, but as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| this Monday coming up is the announcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| of the Fragile 15 at 11 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| at the Knoxville High School, and then this Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| there's a workshop on historic windows at Westwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| We have summer supper tickets going on sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| There are luncheons and talks and tours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| going on through the whole month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| so if you go to the website or check the press release,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| you'll see all these events listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| for Preservation Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| Thank you, Kay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| Any questions from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| Yes, Kay, I wanted to ask you about Knoxville College,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| and it says 10 buildings are compromised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| the National Register of Historic District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| Are there some buildings that are themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| on the National Historic Register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| that cannot be demolished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| The entire older part of the campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| the buildings that are pre-1950| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| are part of the collection of the Historic District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| that is on the National Register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| However, the National Register's Historic District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| doesn't provide any, is not regulatory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| so it is not a tool to prevent demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| That happens at the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| So, it's not a tool to prevent demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| That happens at the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| Are there no buildings on the campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| that could not be demolished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| I guess that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| There are no buildings on the campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| that have a protection that requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| that they be preserved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| and so any of them could be demolished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| because there's no regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| associated with the National Register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| That is an honorific designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| that provides an opportunity to apply for grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| and tax credits and that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| but there's no prohibition on demolition of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| so none of those buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| have that type of protection on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| All right, thank you very much, Kay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| Now we'll move on to reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| This Saturday, the annual festival event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=848)|

| 0:14:29| They've got a tremendous amount of music venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| They have booths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| They have crafts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=875)|
| 0:14:35| They have food vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| They just have so many things that are just fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| It's a very family-friendly event as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| so I've checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| It's gonna be 68 degrees, sunny, no humidity, and no rain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=888)|
| 0:14:53| so you can airdrop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| You can ride your bike in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| You can Uber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| You can walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| You can do a tricycle, but just get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=899)|

| 0:19:36| on the same page, and we had our differences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| but he was always a gentleman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| and he was great to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=1181)|

| 0:20:06| to the meetings at which he appeared before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| or other organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=1208)|

| 0:20:13| who are in this room, and he was always concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| with getting things right as he saw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=1217)|

| 0:20:31| on the other side, and maybe you were not his friend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| on this issue, but that was only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| when you were discussing the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=1236)|

| 0:20:42| outside of that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=1242)|

| 0:20:46| to people behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=1246)|

| 0:20:50| I know it's difficult for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=1250)|

| 0:21:02| I'm not one of those, so I'm going to stop here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=1262)|

| 0:46:31| Thank you, Madeline Rajero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| Before I speak, I'd like to ask those in support of why I'm here tonight to also stand up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2795)|

| 0:46:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| You don't have to stand up, Mr. Campion, it's okay, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| In regards to why I'm here tonight is on behalf of the residents of the Lonsdale community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| and in regards to the proposed MOU sports complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2831)|
| 0:47:20| Without getting into the pros and cons of the proposed complex, what I was asked because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2840)|
| 0:47:27| we've had a couple of meetings over the last couple of weeks I have with the members of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| the community and they decided at the last two meetings that we would come here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2852)|
| 0:47:39| which Mr. Campion, you know, a couple of weeks ago we had talked and we were hoping to not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| come so soon, but based on the majority of the people at the meetings, they want to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2863)|
| 0:47:50| tonight in hopes that we could ask you, Mayor Rajero, to basically put a halt on whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2870)|
| 0:48:01| discussions you're having with the proposed land to sell to MOU for the building of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| proposed complex in hopes that it would give the entire community a chance to, possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2886)|
| 0:48:14| through focus groups, a chance to figure out is this the best thing for the community and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2894)|
| 0:48:23| also if, what if some other alternatives the community could come up with, they seem best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2903)|
| 0:48:30| to benefit the community with the use of that land that you're proposing to, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| assume, sell to MOU Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| And also, you know, we're very grateful that the city is wanting to give to the Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| community even though it appears to be through MOU Foundation, but at the same time, a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2926)|
| 0:48:53| of people, including myself and a lot of people that actually live in the Lonsdale community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| was made aware of this proposed complex here in the last several weeks through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2938)|
| 0:49:06| media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| For example, Nikki Daniels, the five-year-old who was gunned down in a tragic drive-by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| shooting, I think it was 1995, her auntie never was at the table in regards to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2953)|
| 0:49:20| particular complex being designed and also the redesigning of the monument that's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2960)|
| 0:49:27| her niece's honor and when she's hearing the news at night, she called me and asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2967)|
| 0:49:33| me had I heard anything about it, which I hadn't, so I immediately called Mr. Campin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| because that is his district, but things like that is what the city, the community in Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| are really disappointed about with this whole, this complex deal about, it looks like it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2983)|
| 0:49:50| moving rapidly fast and I think that's why they suggested that we come up here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| to ask you to give us some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| I don't know what's feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| They said ask for a year to basically look in to see what it is the MOU foregoing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=2999)|
| 0:50:09| all about in regards to benefiting the Lonsdale community and also if there are some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3009)|
| 0:50:16| suggestions that the community can come up with that would better serve the people, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| kids of course, from kids to seniors in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| So on behalf of, I don't know, dozens and dozens of people that have attended the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| two meetings in the community and also dozens of people who I've communicated with through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| social media and through around town and phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| I got three phone calls today because they were aware that I was coming up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| So on behalf of the Lonsdale community, and I know there have been some people from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| the community who have been supporting, you know, the complex, I'm aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3051)|
| 0:50:57| But at the same time, I think from what I can see, from where I stand, there's a majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| who were just kind of, this just kind of was just dropped in their lap about what's being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3063)|
| 0:51:10| proposed in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| So that's why I'm here to ask if you would basically, you know, stop the negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3072)|
| 0:51:20| and give us some time to, as a community, those who are for and against to try to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3080)|
| 0:51:27| together as one and make the best decision that's, you know, that would benefit the Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| And your five minutes are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| And I would normally, we don't have a back and forth, but I do just want to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| first of all, thank you all who came tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| And thank you for coming, Maurice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| I know I've reached out to you a couple times, invited you to come in and talk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| We haven't done that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| So I'm glad you came here so we can set up that meeting to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3112)|
| 0:51:59| The process, so you all understand the way the process works on something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| or whomever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| There is a proposal from any organization or developers or whomever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3125)|
| 0:52:11| There are initial discussions, and when, I know when Emerald Youth came to us with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| proposal that they had, they wanted to invest in a community who needed, who had a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3137)|
| 0:52:26| kids who needed recreation and structured opportunities and all the other features in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| the project that they're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| And the first thing we said was, go talk to people and see if it's something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| It sounds good to me, but I don't live in the neighborhood, so go talk to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| And so they started having those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| And they, well they did with some people, obviously, I know there were people in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| room who they probably didn't speak with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| But I know they spoke with people, because I've talked to folks whom they have spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| And they've now talked to about 200 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| Okay, but let me just explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| I'm not saying that you were spoke, that they spoke with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| But you begin, what you do is you start the conversations, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| And then at some point you make the announcement, the proposal, so that we're sure that everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| will be aware of it, so then we can have the further conversations to address what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| concerns are, what people like about it, what they don't like about it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| And I will tell you that in my years on this, in this seat, I know that there are good and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| reasonable people who disagree in a community on what's right and what's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| So there are people that are very much behind this, then I see there are people that still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| have questions, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| So what I would like to do is for us to continue to talk, to, you know, let me, first I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3220)|
| 0:53:48| going to explain to you the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| For this to move forward, we have to come up with a proposal, a proposed agreement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3230)|
| 0:53:56| Emerald Youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| And before that, the school board has to vote to give a portion of Sammy Hill property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3238)|
| 0:54:08| to surplus that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| And then the county commission has to agree to make that property available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3250)|
| 0:54:17| And then it comes to city council, so there's like three public meetings, public steps in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3257)|
| 0:54:23| order to even get to where we would vote on a agreement with Emerald Youth Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3263)|
| 0:54:30| I would welcome meetings and discussions with you all and with other people in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3270)|
| 0:54:36| those who say they want it, who see this as a good, as an asset to the kids and to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| I've read some of the stuff that's been put out against it, and frankly, there are a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| of mischaracterizations, and I want us to clear those up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| I want us to have those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| And so, because I'm really disturbed, it's one thing to disagree, it's another thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3294)|
| 0:55:00| when there are faults, when there's false information out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| And so we want to clear that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| But there are, we are in, this is the period of having discussion about whether this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3305)|
| 0:55:14| a good proposal for the community or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| Okay, and I know you don't want to go back and forth, but would you be willing to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| out to a community meeting with the community and Emerald as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| And of course, Mark Kampen and I think State Rep. Eddie Smith, he would be available the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170509?start=3325)|
