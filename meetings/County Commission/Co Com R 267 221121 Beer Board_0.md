| 0:08:05| We admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=486)|

| 0:08:23| So we take it very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=503)|

| 0:09:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=544)|

| 0:09:10| Do you know what the price is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| I should ask the other gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=552)|

| 0:09:22| It's cheaper to buy the machine now than it is to pay the $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=566)|

| 0:09:52| $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| I'll offer a motion then that we impose a $1,000 fine for the first offense at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=593)|

| 0:13:09| The business owner now was the person who was charged with the third violation of the previous business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=789)|
| 0:13:17| He may or may not have owned the business at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| The previous business owner was fined for the third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| And then Mr. Salonky was issued a beer permit in June, I believe it is, of 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=805)|
| 0:13:37| But this is his second offense, selling alcohol to an underage person, not just the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=817)|
| 0:13:44| the business owner's second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| So the location seems to have a history of selling to underage persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| That's one of the reasons I recommend that they install a machine that scans every sale to alleviate this problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=835)|
| 0:14:03| so it doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| Well, I was waiting for Lieutenant Lawson to finish his comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| I grew up in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| That location has always been a spot that everybody went to when you were underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| And I'm 43 now, and it seems to be the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| We find them three times within a seven-month period, from 20 to 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=866)|
| 0:14:33| The business has complied recently, but the owner is in his second violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=873)|
| 0:14:40| The sheriff's office is of the stance that this business and its location lead to the sale to underage persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=880)|
| 0:14:49| the type of clientele that may go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| They don't have gas pumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| It's strictly, you know, food and beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| And I think it's just going to continue no matter who the owner is, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| But those machines only work if you use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| They didn't check the person's ID in this case, so a machine would have done no good for the violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=907)|
| 0:15:16| So to be clear, they did not check anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| And it was the business owner who the licenses issued in his name did not check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| And he's saying now this is the second time the owner of the business has not checked the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| which the beer permit is in his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| And that is the owner of the business next to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| Solonky, Mr. Solonky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| Commissioner Frazier, are you holding for a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| No, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| All right, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| You said you had implemented some preventative measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| Was that done after the first offense on September 21st of 22?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| When was the machine installed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| After three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| After.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| And you just issued a beer permit in 2021, and you've already had two offenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| Just to clarify with our sheriff's office, there were three violations in a seven-month period between 2020 and 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=989)|
| 0:16:38| and then the business was sold from the person who had violated before or whoever was responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=998)|
| 0:16:47| Then the business was sold to this gentleman in 2021, and since then they've had two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1007)|
| 0:16:54| When the business was sold, they may have records when it was sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| In April of 21, when Mr. Solonky originally appeared, he was not an employee of Big D's Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1020)|
| 0:17:07| He was testing it out, as they stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| I guess see what kind of business it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| When they produced documents in May of 21 to get a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| it appeared that he owned the business when that third violation took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| but the previous owner had already been fined $1,500 or $2,500, whatever it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| and whatever suspension may have come with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| But in a two-year period, you've had five violations at the same place, correct, regardless of the two ownerships?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1054)|
| 0:17:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| This is not my motion to make, but I can't see why in the world we would continue to fine after five times in two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1065)|
| 0:17:53| but I'll defer to the defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| Commissioner Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| Sir, can you clarify when, in fact, your scanners were installed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1083)|
| 0:18:10| When were the scanners installed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| After that last violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| After the last violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| So after October 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| No, after September 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| So after September 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| So the second offense was October 17th, and you did have scanners installed and operational, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1106)|
| 0:18:36| After that violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| After the second violation, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| It was after the October 17th violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1122)|
| 0:18:49| Could you speak into the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| He put the sign everywhere on the beer doors and in the front, and he installed the ID check machine after that violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1133)|
| 0:19:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Sir, could you give your name and address, please, since you have spoken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| My name is Harshal Chauhan, and he's my uncle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| You'll need to say your name again and spell it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| Harshal Chauhan, H-A-R-S-H-A-L-C-H-A-U-H-A-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1159)|
| 0:19:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| So to go along with what Lieutenant Lawson just told us, scanners are only good, and they only work if we use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1176)|
| 0:19:47| And this is coming from the second violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| I'm looking at this list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| The person who sold the beer to the underage person is you, sir, the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1191)|
| 0:19:58| So I cannot reiterate how important it is that we actually use these scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1198)|
| 0:20:06| If you're not checking an ID, how do we know you're going to use the scanner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| So I would be inclined to agree with Commissioner Jay on this one because this is, in fact, the owner's second offense himself in selling to underage in about a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1212)|
| 0:20:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| Is there any relation between yourself and the prior owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| No relation between you and the prior owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| No family, good friend, anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| No relation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| It was an arm's length transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| I handled the paperwork for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| It was an arm's length deal when they sold it and bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Mr. Law Director, can you just give me a summary of our options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| The only option you have in front of you is to rule on the second offense here because we don't have any other proof before us as to anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1270)|
| 0:21:18| So what it is is the second offense, which he's admitted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| Now, you have the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| Commissioner Schoomaker just asked me, under state law, you've got down a $2,500 fine or 60-day suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1284)|
| 0:21:33| and what state law says is that this board may, may, the word is may, offer a fine, a civil fine, in lieu of a suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1293)|
| 0:21:44| So that's what you've got in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| But this board can suspend a license for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| In the state law, the may means that you may, which you normally do, offer the fine in lieu of the suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1315)|
| 0:22:04| But under state law, you may not offer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| You don't have to offer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| Sir, I'm going to make a motion for a 90-day suspension, and I'm not going to offer you, my motion does not give you the option for a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1332)|
| 0:22:22| And let me tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| You were part of this operation at some point during the previous violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1345)|
| 0:22:32| You were an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| You were something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| We have seen you for many times over the last few years that I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| But the fact that the last two times you as the owner who have been here, who have heard us, who know it, still violated the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1358)|
| 0:22:47| that means that you're setting the precedence that it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| And if it doesn't matter to you, then it really irritates us, I can tell you that, because we work really hard to make sure that this is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1370)|
| 0:22:58| In addition, our sheriff's office has given us a recommendation of this is the place you go if you want to buy underage beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1378)|
| 0:23:05| And I think if we don't set a firm line in the sand, we're asking for a disaster here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1385)|
| 0:23:12| So I'm going to make a motion to do a 90-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| And if you come back after that 90 days and you can demonstrate that you should get your beer permit back and operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1395)|
| 0:23:23| but I guarantee you that sheriff's office on your 91st day is going to be there probably every day buying beer and watching you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1403)|
| 0:23:30| then the next step is probably going to be a full-on suspension altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| And 90 days should hurt, but it should also send a signal that it's not about just paying fines and breaking the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1415)|
| 0:23:42| It's about doing something that is responsible as a beer permit holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| So that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| Commissioner Jay, the law director has just informed me that 60 days is the maximum that we can allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1428)|
| 0:23:56| I'll amend my motion to 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| I don't think it's enough, but I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Motion by Jay, second by Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| Madam Chair, can the sheriff's office explain what's going to happen to our beer permit holder when a suspension happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1455)|
| 0:24:28| So he'll need to remove all beer or place padlocks over the refrigerators that are holding the alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1468)|
| 0:24:37| We've had them take butcher's paper, put it over the windows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| and then padlock it so they don't have to remove all their inventory so they don't lose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| But it can't be readily accessible to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| It needs to be out of their view or locked up to where they can't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1491)|
| 0:24:58| Does your client understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| I'll explain it to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| You want to make sure they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| And, Lieutenant Lawson, will your officers still police that place during the suspension time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1504)|
| 0:25:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1512)|

| 0:25:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1520)|

| 0:25:25| It'll go into place at midnight tonight, so they'll need to get that locked up pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Do they understand that then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| I'll make sure they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Excuse me, Mr. Attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1536)|

| 0:29:08| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| No concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Pending certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| Fire Marshal, I assume, is certificate of occupancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| Pending, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| But the Health Department, we don't have anything from them at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| so we'll need to get a report from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| and I think Kathy Bailey will ask them for that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| I'll turn it back over to you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| So what we will need from you, assuming this is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| is you've surrendered the old beer permit, a certificate of registration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1783)|
| 0:29:51| Knox County business license, pending a certificate of occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| and a report from the Health Department, which will be our responsibility to obtain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1798)|
| 0:30:07| Do you have any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| Yeah, just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| It seems like every month they're not showing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| the Health Department or the fire or whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| Aren't they compelled to be here, Fall Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| I don't know if they're compelled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| I think we got an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| Who did we get an e-mail from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| From the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| From fire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| Sometimes they can't be here, and, I mean, sometimes it's just I don't think we can compel them to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| but it's certainly part of their duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| But we have been in the past, if they've sent in an e-mail saying I have no problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| or subject to a certificate of occupancy, we go ahead and accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| You know, it's never happened, but what if the fire marshal says that no or yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1850)|
| 0:30:59| and then they're not here and the applicant wants to confront them, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| Well, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| We need to compel them to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Anticipating a motion from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| Defer to Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| Can you help explain, just because I'm confused, is this an entirely new business at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1884)|
| 0:31:31| because we have Lakeside Tavern, Concord Marina, and it's all kind of one big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| can you just help explain the difference between?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| Lakeside Tavern is at the top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| Concord Marina is a different business at the bottom of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| It's a name change, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| Okay, so totally different operation altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| We just had another discussion about not a beer issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| but another issue across the street at the Concord Yacht Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| and there's a lot of Concord Marina Yacht Club discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| I want to be very clear about what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| So this is that smaller place on the bottom left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| It's like the little White House, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| This is the marina itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| Down at the fuel dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| So you come in, you get your ice, you get your beer, you get your snacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Fill up your boat with fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| Just wanted clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1950)|

| 0:32:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| So Darby Campbell basically is the same general partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| and are some people getting out of the LLC and other ones getting in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| or is it still all the same group, just a total structural name change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| I was not provided that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| I just know that Darby Campbell was the owner and he will be the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1977)|

| 0:33:02| completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-beer-board?start=1984)|
