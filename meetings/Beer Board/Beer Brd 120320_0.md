| 0:02:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| I was wondering, is this related to the original Harb's Super-Rent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| In other words, it's just a change in the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=149)|

| 0:02:51| Fifty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| Fifty, not the 300?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=173)|

| 0:04:10| We're in an empty Walmart building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=250)|

| 0:04:19| But we found that we have terrific neighborhood and community support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| The business operates in the black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=262)|

| 0:04:41| He's from Brooklyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| He tells me it's the best thing this side of the Mason-Dixon line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| And Queenie's is his standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| I've never been there myself, but Ted says that it's delicious there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=289)|

| 0:08:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Ms. Zier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| We need the fire prevention approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=529)|

| 0:08:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| Now, tell us a little bit about we know what WDVX is, particularly Councilman DelaVope is an expert on bluegrass music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| He's going to be organizing a big city festival soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| Do you want to tell us a little bit about the permit and where you're going with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| This permit would be used specifically for beverage sales at the Knoxville Visitor Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=552)|
| 0:09:20| which is where DVX is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| We're producing a new show, a new live show that's broadcast every Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| It's Tennessee Shines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| Some of you may be familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| It used to be at the Bijou Theater, but we've scaled it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| We kept the name because we felt like it was the opportunity to highlight East Tennessee culture and music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=576)|
| 0:09:44| So we're having it at the Knoxville Visitor Center now on Monday nights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| and we'd like to be able to provide adult beverages with music and bluegrass music, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| Councilman DelaVope, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| I was just going to ask her if this was the year we were going to have a market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| square bluegrass festival, old-timey festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| You guys did one out in Cosby or something, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| In Cosby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| No, we've never done one in Cosby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| Bristol Rhythm and Roots, we broadcast from there before up in Johnson City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| Have you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| It would be really neat because you guys have a lot of marketing ability to let people know about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| and we're sitting here in the middle of, you know, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, all that kind of good route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| Well, we feel like we've got that covered with the Blue Plate Special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| You know, we broadcast from there every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| I was thinking of another hundred thousand people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| But thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=643)|

| 0:10:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Next on our agenda is Doodles 5000 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| And I think there's a spokesperson here for Doodles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| Just as a reminder, these people first applied for an application in August of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=667)|
| 0:11:16| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Michael Carroll, 7001 Wellington Drive, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=677)|
| 0:11:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| I'm sure you're not here to tell us that Doodles is opening tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| So do you want to share with us the situation and any plea you want to make for special leniency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=687)|
| 0:11:36| Well, the owner couldn't be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| He's sick, so he telephoned me and asked me if I would come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| I leased the building to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| It's the old Winn-Dixie store there in the old Kmart shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| And everything in that building is out of code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| And I just talked to the owner there a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| I went outside and called him, and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| We just got another one yesterday from the fire marshal about the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| They've had to do everything from the sprinkler system to whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| And they have to have it inspected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| Well, they have to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| It's just been a lot of waiting until the inspector comes, and then they do a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| and then they wait a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| And it's not anything that anybody's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| It's just, you know, it's just an old building that's got to be brought up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=748)|
| 0:12:37| And they need some more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Charlie Witt, if you know, if any of you all know Charlie, he does a lot of stuff for Food City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| And he's come in there to be the main contractor, and they've got two more contractors in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| And they've already spent over $100,000 that they didn't intend to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| So that's how far out of code this thing was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| But they're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| How much longer do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| Another 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Can it be 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| Well, you know, I could stand here and say, yes, but I was out there yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| and I think they need 60 days to really get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| And I talked to Charlie about it, and Charlie said, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| He said, I'd rather have 60 days than I think I can get everything done and everything inspected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=799)|
| 0:13:26| They're going to have to put a firewall in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| And they just found this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| And, you know, it will take a little time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| But I think they need 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| You know, we started this one back in, as I said, back in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| And I said, one of the questions I have is, what does it cost to have a permit or to get a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=827)|
| 0:13:55| What does it cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| The application is $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| You know, I'm sort of torn with this because I know that there are extenuating circumstances that different projects have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=842)|
| 0:14:09| in terms of getting ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| But, I mean, we've extended this and extended it and extended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| And we, as a city, have expended quite a bit of money also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| You know, when you consider $250, we've probably spent far more than $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| And if they're not sure if it's going to be 30 days or 60 days or 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| it seems to me the best thing to do is for them to really find out when it is that they're going to be able to open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| and then start the process over again, as far as if we're talking, you know, $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| Because, you know, how many times do you go through the paperwork and send the letters and this sort of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| And, plus, the other concern, and I am sorry that the owner can't be here because of sickness, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=882)|
| 0:14:48| we take this beer board pretty seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| And I think that we need the owner here to tell us what's going on also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| So I'm really not in favor of extending this any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| And I think that they ought to kind of get their act together and then reapply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| which apparently they have most of their information together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| Is this it or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| Just their inspections because of ongoing work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| Anyway, that's my feelings about the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| And, again, you know, we don't want to stop people from having a business and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| But I think that, you know, almost a year extension, that's going a little bit overboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Councilman Deleveaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Yeah, I'm going to respectfully disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| It sounds like this guy is working to fix a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| He's running into unforeseen problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| Now, maybe if he had a good architect like Duane or someone who would have anticipated those code problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| they would have attacked him sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| But he is struggling to open a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| He's investing money in a business that will help Knoxville as well as himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| And since we're not talking about issues where he's violated some, you know, some conduct rule or some rule of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=950)|
| 0:15:57| beer board, I just assume give him the 60 days and let him get his business together and open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| I think that's fair to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| He shouldn't put another burden on him, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| Could I say something there about the inspection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| With the beer board's permission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| They have been held up some by inspections because they're behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| That's what they say on getting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| They brought in an outside architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| The city came out and said, you have to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| They're the city's architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| And they did all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| And then they had another architect come behind them to make sure they didn't have to go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| And they were on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| So they're not really doing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| They're just working diligently to try to get it open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| And believe you me, they want to get it open because all they're doing is spending money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Vice Mayor Pavley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Well, I agree with Councilman DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| If they weren't working on the project, then I could see perhaps, you know, not moving forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| But, you know, they've got construction going on daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| They, you know, some of it allegedly has been our fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| And, you know, perhaps so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| It's not the first time that we've heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| And so, you know, if they're putting that kind of money into it, I hate to see, you know, even though it's $250,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1038)|
| 0:17:25| but it's still $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| If I remember right, you all are going to employ about 70 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| Once you get open and, you know, in this day and time, that's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| There's people that's going to be able to make a living out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| So I am going to support the 60-day extension, but I would hope that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1057)|
| 0:17:44| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| When you vote, then I'll say something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| You say you all are converting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| Are you splitting Old Winn-Dixie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| Yeah, there's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Into a smaller space, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Well, it's 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| And then there's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| The original Winn-Dixie was larger than 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| Oh, the original Winn-Dixie is about 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| That whole place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| And the whole building is out of codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| So a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| This here opened up a whole can of worms for that whole deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| So Doodles came in and said, well, we want to lease 10,000 square feet of the 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| I mean, I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| I mean, you knew you had to put a firewall up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| I mean, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| I mean, you had to divide the space with a firewall, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| And they figured they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| And they called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| They actually called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| And everybody knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Well, they called the fire marshal themselves and asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| And they knew it had to go to the deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| I mean, it's got to go all the way to the deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| They gutted it all the way to the walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| They've had electrical problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| They've had plumbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| And so everything in that thing is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| I just don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| I mean, I just think this goes back to my question all along, ever since we came on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| that why we approve things that aren't finished is beyond me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| And we just approved one that had five outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| And it's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| I think they knew last August that that work was going to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| And, I mean, it takes a lot of our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| I think it's, you know, it's just, I just think it's bad on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| We approved it once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| I'm not opposed to approving it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| But I really think we need to look at what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| And one or two is acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| But four or five things is just unacceptable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| But that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| Thank you, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| You know, I tend to agree with Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| And I guess I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| How much does it really cost the city to grant an extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| Is there any type of way to assess it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| We send certified mail for each additional account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| I mean, billboard meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| And we don't expend additional advertising money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1197)|
| 0:20:04| So it's basically copying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| I mean, we have to provide you copies every meeting that this is, that it comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| And then send certified mail to notify them to be here at the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| I'm just talking a couple dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| I mean, for copies and one piece of mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| You know, I think it's important that, you know, in my opinion, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| that we are friendly to business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| I mean, here's a business that they're putting hundreds, you know, tens of thousands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| if not hundreds of thousands of dollars into rehabbing a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| And we're trying to give them a hard time about an extension that's going to cost the city a couple of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| I just think we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| Construction is, I don't know that much about it, but one thing I do know about it, can be unpredictable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| And things take different amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| And I think that we as a beer board, we represent the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| And we should be friendly to business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| People complain about government bureaucracy and red tape and having this long discussion about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| a couple of dollars for the city versus, you know, the $250 for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| I just don't think that's that big a deal to grant extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| I mean, they're putting, they're just investing tens, hundreds of thousands of dollars into our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| So I think we can grant them a six-day extension that's, you know, we have to send one more piece of mail out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1283)|
| 0:21:30| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| I just want to make it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| I am not against business, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| And I'm excited that we have a new place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| But, you know, and it's more than a couple of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| We have staff time that's involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| And I just think that we, in the past, in the couple of years that I've been on here, we're kind of setting a precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| that says, oh, well, if you're not ready in 30 days, we'll grant you another 30, we'll grant you another 60,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| we'll grant you another 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| And the point is, the gentleman's already told us it will be at least 60 days before he comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| So during that time, he has plenty of time to request another beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| And it's not a matter of, it's not a matter of me saying, hey, I'm against them having a business or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1328)|
| 0:22:16| But we need to hold people who want a beer permit to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| We need to hold them accountable to what it is in order to make an establishment ready for inspections and codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1340)|
| 0:22:27| And this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| And it's like Councilman Wallace says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| I mean, you go into a building, and you look at it, and all of a sudden you say, well, gee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| I'm going to have a beer establishment here in 30 days, and it's a building that you've got to gut and do all this to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| What it does is it puts a burden on us to have to, you know, continuously re-approve and re-approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1361)|
| 0:22:48| And so I'm not trying to make a point out of you in terms of, you know, make you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| It's just that I think, you know, how many times are we going to grant approvals on something that may be started way too soon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1374)|
| 0:23:01| And I think this is probably a perfect situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| Now, if it's going to take them another 60 days or 90 days, then they ought to just start the process over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| You know, again, it's $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| But it's also, it says something about this beer board and the standards that we're going to hold up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| and the standards that we believe in that we feel that people should have in order to get a beer permit in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1396)|
| 0:23:23| So that's where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| Listening to the conversation, I think the way to handle this is to look at our rules and our requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1410)|
| 0:23:37| and maybe have a two or three extension limit kind of thing put into the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| Maybe even have, if you apply for an extension, that you have to pay a $25 fee or some fee that reasonably covers the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1422)|
| 0:23:51| It ought to be fair on both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| But I think we ought to have some advance notice or rattling of the saber or the chains or whatever that says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1433)|
| 0:24:00| three strikes and you're out or whatever kind of thing, rather than doing this ad hoc at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| I think that's a fine idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| I think the other thing we need to think about is we don't have the owner here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| We don't have the person who wants the permit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| And I think that's, to me, that's also a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| But I do agree with Councilman DellaVolpe that we do need to look at our rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| But, again, we have a situation where a guy's been here four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| I mean, come on, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| I want to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| I guess if we decide to institute what Councilman DellaVolpe just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| will we need to go to our city or council attorney and get that written in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1481)|
| 0:24:49| Because, really, it would not be fair for someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| We've been doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| And then when we'll just use him for an example since he's here and say, well, we're not going to do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1495)|
| 0:25:02| But what Councilman DellaVolpe suggested might be a reasonable thing to think about in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1502)|
| 0:25:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Councilwoman Comrie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| When Mr. Frost returns from the Wild West, I will share with him Councilman DellaVolpe's suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1512)|
| 0:25:19| And his standing is right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| But I promised him we wouldn't put him on the spot tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| Let's put him on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| But I think that probably we can sit down with Mr. Frost and take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| Consider, you know, a three extension, you know, a fee each time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1533)|
| 0:25:40| When grief holds up two fingers, I guess that means two times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| I would agree that we have been extremely lenient in the past in granting extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| I think in some cases we have premature applications that people are excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| They think that their business is going to be constructed, ready to open yesterday, and that isn't the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1556)|
| 0:26:03| And any time you get into an old building like this or sometimes even new construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| whatever can go wrong probably will when you're trying to get open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| So I think that that being the case, I'm going to ask for a motion to approve a 60-day extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1573)|
| 0:26:21| and that would bring this back to the board on May the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| Now that you voted, all of you are going to be invited to come out and eat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| and they'll have the best prime rib in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| Councilman Gurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Does that include me, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| It includes me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| You actually get the little beef tips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| That's all you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| I get the leftovers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| I know he'll thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| I know he'll thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Thank you, Mr. Carroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| There might be a little problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| I was going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| Mr. Pavlis, I want your portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| You can have it, trust me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| We come to the next part of the beer board meeting, and this is the administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| And we have Magnolia Quick Market and Latitude 35 who are going to be here with plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| And I see that Magnolia Quick Market is ready to jump up and tell us about their plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1641)|
| 0:27:30| and be sure that we won't see them a third time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| I was actually here a month ago, and we kind of went over the nuts and bolts of this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| and went over the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| But the board had requested that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| Norman McKellar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| I'm an attorney here in town, 603 Main Street, Suite 405.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| I represent Magnolia Quick Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| And I'm here with Mr. Arar, who is the proprietor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| He was not able to attend last time due to being out of town with his wife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| who is undergoing medical treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| As you can see, he's here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Last time we had discussed the details of the revised plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| and gone over kind of, like I said, the nuts and bolts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| But the board had requested that Mr. Arar attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| So he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Vice Mayor Pavlis, would you like to begin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| Well, I just want to, for clarity, it is a requirement in the ordinance that the owner be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1698)|
| 0:28:25| So we didn't just pick on this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| It is a requirement that has been set forth before 30 days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| So I just want you to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Mr. Arar, do you want to tell us, in your own words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| how you're going to be sure this plan works since this is your second citation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| Well, basically, I'm going to do a little bit more of training, like me personally with my employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1727)|
| 0:28:55| especially since I've been having like certain issues, health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| So I have more people working for me at the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| Basically, taking the test class at first and then me talking to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| and telling them about the consequences of having such mistakes in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1749)|
| 0:29:16| as far as probably losing their jobs or, you know, having to pay all these fines and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| And I hope that will do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| Like a traditional machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| And then I'm in the process of purchasing another machine for the second cash register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| Most people find that each register needs to have its own checking system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| I know that's an expense, but these fines mount up and other consequences would not be very agreeable either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1781)|
| 0:29:48| Do I have any questions from anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| Counsel in Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| I just wanted to tell the gentleman, your lawyer did a fine job when he was here last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| but the board wanted to see you come because it was important that you realize we take this seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| and that we don't want to have underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| And when these violations mount up, then action has to be taken, including severe action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| But that's why you're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| And just to let you know that it's important to the community that children not get in this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| where they drink and they're going to be out in the car and drive and get in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| And we're hoping that your new training practices and your new machines will prevent that from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1824)|
| 0:30:31| So thank you for coming and thank you for looking into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| And I hope you'll follow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| Hopefully so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| I'm going to ask, how many employees do you have there that you have to train?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| Just two right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| Just two and yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| Including myself, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| Just you and one other person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| Two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Three total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Three all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| This is not something we need a motion, but your board, we need to understand that we have two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| One is to take no further action and the third one is to send it for further review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| I move that we take no further action, that we'll accept his plan of action here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| Everybody in agreement with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| We enjoyed seeing you tonight, but we would not like to see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| The next is latitude 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1883)|
| 0:31:31| Please read the names and addresses, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| I'm Harry Wade, a partner in latitude 35, 16 Market Square Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1894)|
| 0:31:42| You were here previously and had a plan that needed some assistance, and we encouraged you to contact the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1902)|
| 0:31:50| Metropolitan Drug Commission, and I have talked with Heather, and she says that you've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| Do you want to just quickly tell us how your plan now is foolproof, new, and different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1915)|
| 0:32:03| Well, the first thing I want to do is I know I've been told all my life it's difficult to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| You never get a second chance to make a first impression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| But I'm going to try again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| And immediately after Councilman Greaves suggested I get with Heather, I did it that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1933)|
| 0:32:20| The next morning, by I think 930, I called her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| And, in fact, she said she was about to call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| She and I spoke, traded e-mails, concluded by meeting together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| I personally went and took the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| I couldn't do it that Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| The first one was Thursday, I think, after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| But we had our plan rewritten by the 27th of February, so I don't know how I could take it any more seriously than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1963)|
| 0:32:51| And I had a lot of good help looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| Heather was great help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| And she gave me one of the kits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| I'm not sure I know the right word for the kit, but Heather, can you tell me the name of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1978)|
| 0:33:06| Top shelf kit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| And it had more things in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| I could not believe there were so many things in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| I brought it back to the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| I let the general manager, whom I'm going to introduce to you all in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| And let me think what else I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| I guess that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| I took the task class, and that was quite an experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| That was an eye-opener, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| A very good experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| And there's even more details to it that are even more interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| But let me introduce, this is Mark Titus, our general manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Mark Titus, 3624 South Creek Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| I am the general manager, Latitude 3516, Market Square, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| All of my managers understand the importance, of course, of carting individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2032)|
| 0:34:01| We do have in place, of course, the stickers that was put on the door, placed on the door as far as carting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2041)|
| 0:34:11| It is essential that all of my managers before the start of day, we actually have two shifts, one beginning at 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2051)|
| 0:34:20| and the next shift comes in at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| Again, it is my directive that there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| they can time out to express the importance of carting individuals that come into our restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2070)|
| 0:34:38| no matter what their age is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| Everyone, my understanding, the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| is that every individual that consumes alcoholic beverages must have a valid identification on their person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2084)|
| 0:34:52| which we strictly enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| To tell you the truth, it should have been enforced to begin with, which it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| but not to the point of the stringency that it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| And I can guarantee you these, this type of activity will not occur again because I'm taking it personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2104)|
| 0:35:11| And I will make it my personal endeavor to ensure the board that this will never, ever occur again at Latitude 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2111)|
| 0:35:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| Any questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| Councilman De La Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| I just wanted to thank Mr. Wade and Mr. Titus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| You had to come back, but it is important to the community that we enforce these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2126)|
| 0:35:33| And I guess you could debate whether the rules are sound or not, but they are the rules of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| So they look into the business to be both a partner and an enforcer in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| And I appreciate your effort at a second impression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| You made a good one, Mr. Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| As an ex-police officer, I understand the importance of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| I work in the Knox County Sheriff's Department, also Clayton County Police Department in Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| I understand the importance of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| I understand what the board does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| It is very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| You don't know I've got a 15-year-old child, although she wouldn't call herself a child right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| But I understand the importance of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| I really, really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| And I take it very, very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| And I think taking that task class is usually an eye-opener for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| And so I appreciate your taking the time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| Does anyone on council have anything else to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| Are we satisfied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| We have no further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| We've enjoyed seeing you, but we would not like to see you under these circumstances again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| Before we adjourn, I just have a couple of quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| Sergeant Hunter was on television over the weekend for a visitation to some sites on St. Patrick's Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2203)|
| 0:36:50| And she was very prominent in the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| I think there was only one violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| Or no violations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| We only found one violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| That was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| I asked her to compile some data because at the drug commission we have a task force that's looking at underage drinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| and what we can do to make sure that this doesn't happen at all, ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| We concluded that probably isn't a realistic goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| But Sergeant Hunter came on board in June of 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| and during that time she's conducted 257 compliance checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| And there was a six-month period where there were no checks because we didn't have any cadets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| It's the policy of the city to only use cadets rather than underage people to do the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2251)|
| 0:37:40| So cadets are the ones that actually do our things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| During that time, she found that there were, out of the 257 checks, only 34 people sold to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| That's 13 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| There were 18 of those on premise and 16 off premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| So it's about equally divided between on and off premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| Of the 34, there were 12 repeaters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| So some people got the message the first time and didn't want another round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2286)|
| 0:38:13| Sergeant Hunter said that in places where there are on premise sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| the biggest issue is when they have someone check at the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| but they don't have a check when the server takes the order or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| So that's probably something that we can work with establishments as they go along to encourage them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120320?start=2306)|
