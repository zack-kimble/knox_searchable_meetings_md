| 2:11:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7865)|
| 2:11:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7866)|
| 2:11:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7867)|
| 2:11:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7868)|
| 2:11:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7869)|
| 2:11:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7870)|
| 2:11:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7871)|
| 2:11:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7872)|
| 2:11:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7873)|
| 2:11:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7874)|
| 2:11:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7875)|
| 2:11:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7876)|
| 2:11:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7877)|
| 2:11:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7878)|
| 2:11:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7879)|
| 2:11:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7880)|
| 2:11:21| Our other concerns is also, if because a lot of developments are being built and not being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7881)|
| 2:11:22| finished out, and if this were to even get to 97, and MPC's magic number is 101, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7882)|
| 2:11:24| we're still going to have 97 people in whatever that development winds out to be coming out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7884)|
| 2:11:30| on our roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7890)|
| 2:11:31| So, it is, it's a bigger scope than what it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7891)|
| 2:11:37| Could we have a condition set in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7897)|
| 2:11:40| That's what I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| What we have concluded is the way that that would be enforced is you would make it a part of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7903)|
| 2:11:49| and require deed restriction as part of the plan to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7909)|
| 2:11:54| And I think that can be done because the specifications clearly provide for deed restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7914)|
| 2:12:01| in the planned residential zoning plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7921)|
| 2:12:04| And so if you want to require that deed restriction as a part of the plan, I think you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7924)|
| 2:12:10| Mr. Donaldson, do you concur with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7930)|
| 2:12:12| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7932)|
| 2:12:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7933)|
| 2:12:14| But, Mr. Swanson or Mrs. Poplin, the city does not enforce deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7934)|
| 2:12:19| That's an action between private property owners, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7942)|
| 2:12:23| Let's stay with the order here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7943)|
| 2:12:26| Typically, if it's a part of the plan, the use on review plan for a planned residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7946)|
| 2:12:34| I think the city could enforce that particular deed restriction because it's called for as a part of that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7954)|
| 2:12:41| as the code allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7961)|
| 2:12:43| Otherwise, you know, just agreements between private parties, we don't enforce deed restrictions and typically we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7963)|
| 2:12:49| This is the only place I can think of right now where we would other than where the city has asked for a deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7969)|
| 2:12:55| restriction and gotten it in favor of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7975)|
| 2:12:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7978)|
| 2:12:59| Mr. Crisp, I see there, but Mr. Hall has had his last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7979)|
| 2:13:01| I'm sorry, Rob, were you through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7981)|
| 2:13:02| Actually, I wanted to follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7982)|
| 2:13:04| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7984)|
| 2:13:05| You know, it sounds like the brief timeout was very beneficial for folks involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7985)|
| 2:13:11| and I hope I'm reading that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7991)|
| 2:13:13| I mean, is this, you know, if we put down a deed restriction that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7993)|
| 2:13:18| I understand Mrs. O'Dell's concern with the number of units that actually are getting built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=7998)|
| 2:13:24| A deed restriction with time limitations built in that it's only can be open for, just for sake of argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8004)|
| 2:13:32| three months, six months, nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| Is that something that you all can agree with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| I don't think so because MPC has tied 101 units to the opening of Nash Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8016)|
| 2:13:43| And if you look at the topography as a practical matter, getting to Nash Road, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8023)|
| 2:13:51| the development will work up the hill as it is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8031)|
| 2:13:53| It will be built in phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| They aren't going in there and build 194 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8035)|
| 2:13:58| They're going to pre-sell and then build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8038)|
| 2:14:02| Now, if we did sell 194 units, yeah, a time limit would be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8042)|
| 2:14:07| But MPC has tied it to the permitting of units for the reason that as your units go up, your traffic goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8047)|
| 2:14:19| Mr. Donaldson, is something that you're hearing the discussion of right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8059)|
| 2:14:23| is that something that MPC can tweak if everybody agrees to get this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8063)|
| 2:14:29| Well, you're hearing this de novo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8069)|
| 2:14:31| So you're not bound by the conditions that the MPC placed on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8071)|
| 2:14:36| You can create your own new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8076)|
| 2:14:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8078)|
| 2:14:39| I just want to thank you for letting me jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| Okay, that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8081)|
| 2:14:42| Let me go to Mr. Hall and then I do share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8082)|
| 2:14:43| We'll come back around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8083)|
| 2:14:44| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8084)|
| 2:14:46| I think my question got answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| I was concerned about Ms. O'Dell's comments about if they never make it to the 101 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8088)|
| 2:14:55| can there be at some point in time that it's agreed that that road would be, that Eastburn would be closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8095)|
| 2:15:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8107)|
| 2:15:08| I mean, five years or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8108)|
| 2:15:09| It could be, but as a practical matter, I'm not sure that works for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8109)|
| 2:15:15| The MPC has tied everything to the permitting of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8115)|
| 2:15:19| But Mr. Donaldson just said that we can, that we pretty much can override| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8119)|
| 2:15:24| and change everything that they just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8124)|
| 2:15:27| I mean, we could do away with the 101 if I understand him correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8127)|
| 2:15:31| I think he's absolutely correct on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| And we could approve it and say 50 if we wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8134)|
| 2:15:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8138)|
| 2:15:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8139)|
| 2:15:40| But it becomes such a burden that you can't do the project, though, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8140)|
| 2:15:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8146)|
| 2:15:47| Pastor Chris, if you want to have a quick word and then I'm going to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8147)|
| 2:15:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| This is a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| I believe people want to see this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8155)|
| 2:15:57| I believe the members of the City Council want to see this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8157)|
| 2:16:00| The nature of a compromise, without trying to educate anyone, is that we compromise with both parties give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8160)|
| 2:16:10| I believe this is a good compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| And we did the 101, and Councilman, you're correct, the City Council can do whatever they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8174)|
| 2:16:20| But we tied that to the 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8180)|
| 2:16:24| I think that's a fair thing, staying with what has been an acceptable policy up to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8184)|
| 2:16:29| is to tie it to 101 before the 101st permit is granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8189)|
| 2:16:35| And then we close that, Eastburn Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8195)|
| 2:16:39| We're people of good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8199)|
| 2:16:40| They're people of good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| We trust them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8202)|
| 2:16:43| They trust us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8203)|
| 2:16:44| Let the City Council make a ruling to that effect, and Nash Road will be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8204)|
| 2:16:49| Eastburn Road will be closed, and everybody will be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8209)|
| 2:16:54| And the project gets done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8217)|
| 2:16:58| I'm going to go to Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8218)|
| 2:16:59| I don't know who's next, but I'm just going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8221)|
| 2:17:02| Mr. Seymour, this question is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8222)|
| 2:17:05| I guess, could you give us a little more specifics about what that access at Eastburn will look like after it's closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8225)|
| 2:17:14| Will the gate be removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| Will there be some landscaping inserted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8236)|
| 2:17:18| What do you assume would happen in a practical sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8238)|
| 2:17:22| Some sort of barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8242)|
| 2:17:23| And I have not thought beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8243)|
| 2:17:25| Obviously, the gate in and the gate out would be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8245)|
| 2:17:30| Part of the driveway, I assume, would be removed so that there would not be a paved portion of the private road inside the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8250)|
| 2:17:38| development up to Eastburn Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| I guess I just want some assurance that not only will it be closed in the sense of day-to-day access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8261)|
| 2:17:48| but that it's not a temptation, you know, for motorcycles or whatever to use, that there will be a barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8268)|
| 2:17:53| or the pavement removed or something to where it's closed in more than just name only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8273)|
| 2:17:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8278)|
| 2:17:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8279)|
| 2:18:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8280)|
| 2:18:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8281)|
| 2:18:02| Councilman Hulquist, and I'll come back over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8282)|
| 2:18:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8284)|
| 2:18:05| Ms. Poplin, do you concur with Mr. Swanson's opinion on enforceability of deed restrictions in this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8285)|
| 2:18:12| that the city could enforce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| Yes, in this particular situation, I do, if it's part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8294)|
| 2:18:18| The reason I asked you is because you would be the one that would have to enforce them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8298)|
| 2:18:22| because that's why I wanted to hear it from your mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8302)|
| 2:18:26| I'm concerned about making sure all the details on the compromise agreement are ironed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8306)|
| 2:18:33| And I don't know, I think they've reached a potentially a tentative compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8313)|
| 2:18:39| There still seems to be some tension there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8319)|
| 2:18:42| And so I don't know that my preference would be to postpone and let them hammer out the details on the compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8322)|
| 2:18:48| over the next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8328)|
| 2:18:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8331)|
| 2:18:52| I'm going to go to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8332)|
| 2:18:55| I think I was last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8335)|
| 2:18:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8336)|
| 2:18:57| Councilman Becker, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8337)|
| 2:18:58| Ms. Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8338)|
| 2:18:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8339)|
| 2:19:00| I guess I'm sort of feeling like Mr. Hulquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8340)|
| 2:19:03| And I guess when Ms. O'Dell left, I remember I said that my what I was hoping is they'd come back and say that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8343)|
| 2:19:10| worth continuing to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8350)|
| 2:19:11| And it sounds like they actually, I think, got further than any of us expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8351)|
| 2:19:15| And I'm glad for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| I guess just for thinking about the options, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8357)|
| 2:19:21| if the folks standing out here sort of have an agreement that says, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8361)|
| 2:19:25| we're going to close Eastburn and we're going to do this, this, and this relative to the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8365)|
| 2:19:29| now we have an appeal on our table right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8369)|
| 2:19:33| What would we actually do to get everything that they're agreeing to into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8373)|
| 2:19:43| If they reached an agreement with regard to a plan, I think they would simply put that agreement down in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8383)|
| 2:19:51| submit it to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8391)|
| 2:19:53| We would make it a part of the record in this case because everything that I've heard so far is something that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8393)|
| 2:19:59| considered at MPC with regard to the Eastburn access and all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8399)|
| 2:20:05| The record is very clear that those kinds of issues were considered at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8405)|
| 2:20:10| And because of that, it would not be required to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8410)|
| 2:20:14| So just so that we had it set forth on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8414)|
| 2:20:18| this council is authorized on the appeal de novo to adopt different provisions of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8418)|
| 2:20:26| so long as they are provisions that MPC has given consideration to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8426)|
| 2:20:32| So we could conceivably do that tonight if people were willing to hang around for a while to work out the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8432)|
| 2:20:40| I can get it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8440)|
| 2:20:43| Conceivably, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8443)|
| 2:20:46| Councilman Bailey and then I'll come to Ms. Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8448)|
| 2:20:50| My observation is I think that there is a compromise in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8450)|
| 2:20:55| There's a number of details that have to be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8455)|
| 2:20:58| And I think that, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8458)|
| 2:21:01| I just want to address all those folks that came both on behalf of the neighborhood and the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8461)|
| 2:21:07| that your presence has been duly noted, I would assume, by all council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8467)|
| 2:21:12| And so, you know, coming back in two weeks, you wouldn't need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8472)|
| 2:21:17| I can't speak for all council members, but I think your presence has been noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8477)|
| 2:21:22| So don't think you have to come back and support either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8482)|
| 2:21:27| But I do think that there is something that can be worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8487)|
| 2:21:30| and I think we ought to postpone it and come back in two weeks and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8490)|
| 2:21:35| Ms. Pilo, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8495)|
| 2:21:38| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8498)|
| 2:21:40| Well, I've been very uncharacteristically quiet this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8500)|
| 2:21:46| but I've given a great deal of thought to this over a long period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8506)|
| 2:21:52| and haven't asked questions because I've spent a great deal of time asking questions over several weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8512)|
| 2:22:00| and made a number of Sunday afternoon visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8520)|
| 2:22:04| You all may have seen me out there driving your streets in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8524)|
| 2:22:10| As a neighborhood advocate, of course, I am very interested in your neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8530)|
| 2:22:16| And I thought the pastor made an extremely poignant point when he reminded us that it isn't just a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8536)|
| 2:22:27| it's the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| And that's my kind of church that becomes a part of the area in which it is serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8549)|
| 2:22:41| I'm just going to have to digress and be personal because I want to say that when I ran for council seven years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8561)|
| 2:22:48| and began to really drive around Knoxville and consider should I have the good fortune to become a city council member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8568)|
| 2:22:59| that I would be trying to serve and be a servant leader for all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8579)|
| 2:23:05| I took that very seriously, very prayerfully, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8585)|
| 2:23:10| And I still do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8590)|
| 2:23:13| It's very difficult to make everybody happy, but I think that I'm looking at I've been a Knoxvillian many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8593)|
| 2:23:27| And I remember a wonderful Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8607)|
| 2:23:32| It was very alive with families, with people, with activities, and a lot of future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8612)|
| 2:23:40| And went away to school, was gone a very short time, and in that short time, you know, things changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8620)|
| 2:23:50| And it was going to be my personal mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8630)|
| 2:23:54| When I became a part of this council for something to change in that part of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8634)|
| 2:24:03| that's just terribly important to me personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8643)|
| 2:24:07| And I appreciate the opportunity to be a part of decisions that can hopefully be a catalyst for that kind of change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8647)|
| 2:24:16| Now, I saw something exciting here a few months ago when the Golden Harvest Church came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8656)|
| 2:24:21| There's a lot of excitement and passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| They are really embarking on a huge mission project that involves a part of East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8663)|
| 2:24:30| I just have to have faith and belief that all you folks have really seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8670)|
| 2:24:37| personally considered what this means and what it could mean to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8677)|
| 2:24:43| what it can mean to the city as a whole, what it can mean to the future of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8683)|
| 2:24:48| And I'm just going to have that kind of confidence and belief in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8688)|
| 2:24:52| I appreciate everybody being willing to put aside personal feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8692)|
| 2:24:58| and to try to incorporate that into something that does unify us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8698)|
| 2:25:03| and will unify us and help us to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8703)|
| 2:25:06| That's so very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8706)|
| 2:25:07| I know there are a lot of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| You all have well asked many technical questions and many other questions that are very, very important to everyone sitting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8709)|
| 2:25:18| And to every one of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8718)|
| 2:25:21| I want to support this because I believe it is really an impetus for something good that is going to help East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8721)|
| 2:25:32| continue to progress and once again become a very vital community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8732)|
| 2:25:38| I think that's just ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8738)|
| 2:25:48| I just want to believe and I just want to be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8748)|
| 2:25:51| And I just want us all to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8751)|
| 2:25:53| So I want you to know that this is not an easy decision to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8753)|
| 2:25:57| that this is not something that we can just say, oh, you know, in the big scope of things, how does it matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8757)|
| 2:26:06| It could matter tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8766)|
| 2:26:08| So I hope that we're ---- and I think you've seen that we have all taken very serious consideration of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8768)|
| 2:26:16| and wanted very much for it to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8776)|
| 2:26:18| Now, I have a lot of confidence in Mr. Seymour and the community leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8778)|
| 2:26:23| and that all of you will work out the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8783)|
| 2:26:26| I just don't want to micromanage this, but I want you to know how important I feel personally that this is to our future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8786)|
| 2:26:35| and to Knoxville's future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| And I want to thank you all for being a part of it and investing a lot of energy and a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8797)|
| 2:26:43| and a lot of concern in it and for giving us the opportunity to participate in something that I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8803)|
| 2:26:50| is going to be a great thing for East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8810)|
| 2:26:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8814)|
| 2:26:55| Councilman Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8815)|
| 2:27:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8822)|
| 2:27:03| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8823)|
| 2:27:04| First, this is not the district that I represent, as I've said many times before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8824)|
| 2:27:09| I look strongly to the district representative as it's their job to ride herd over big issues such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8829)|
| 2:27:16| But, you know, tonight apparently that timeout has been fruitful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8836)|
| 2:27:21| There may be some common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8841)|
| 2:27:25| My full-time job, other than this job, is an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8845)|
| 2:27:31| If there's a decision and an agreement tonight, this is not something that you want scratched out on the back of an envelope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8851)|
| 2:27:39| It is a very serious decision that both sides need the opportunity to pause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8859)|
| 2:27:47| and reflect and consider the language because it will be binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8867)|
| 2:27:53| In that regard, I'm not sure that this can be decided tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8873)|
| 2:27:57| I'm sure people aren't going to like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8877)|
| 2:28:00| But when there's time, it allows for the protection and the satisfaction of all sides in this argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8880)|
| 2:28:09| You know, I certainly would be willing to seriously consider a motion for a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8889)|
| 2:28:15| to allow that to occur to see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8895)|
| 2:28:18| But it's, in my opinion, it's in everyone's best interest to sit down, take some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8898)|
| 2:28:25| see what we can put on paper, and see if we can come back, whether it's in two weeks or four weeks' time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8905)|
| 2:28:31| holding hands, perhaps, and taking care of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8911)|
| 2:28:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8917)|
| 2:28:38| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8918)|
| 2:28:39| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8919)|
| 2:28:40| And actually, Councilman Frost's comments takes care of part of my comments because I lean very heavily to the position he just stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8920)|
| 2:28:48| because this is very serious and I think they're a lot closer than they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8928)|
| 2:28:54| But I do think because of the type of agreement that is trying to be crafted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8934)|
| 2:29:01| you can't sit here and just use Councilman Frost's language, crafted on the back of an envelope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8941)|
| 2:29:05| or on the back of a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8945)|
| 2:29:08| So, you know, I do think that it would be very beneficial to make sure that the language is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8948)|
| 2:29:14| that Mr. Seymour feels real good about the language and he's a very seasoned attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8954)|
| 2:29:19| and may feel very comfortable with it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8959)|
| 2:29:22| I want to make sure that all parties, Ms. O'Dell, myself, are very comfortable with what language we come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8962)|
| 2:29:29| So before I make the motion I'm about to make, let me say one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8969)|
| 2:29:33| And I've said here, and this is not going to go over well, but I've said here and I've listened to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8973)|
| 2:29:39| and I've seen all these e-mails, I've grown up in East Nassau, living in East Nassau all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8979)|
| 2:29:46| I get really sensitive when folks talk about East Nassau as if it is some dilapidated, poor, run-down community totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8986)|
| 2:29:56| And it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8996)|
| 2:29:57| You know, I take great acceptance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=8997)|
| 2:30:01| There are great things being done all over East Nassau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9001)|
| 2:30:04| I would invite folks to visit Western Avenue, visit Dedrick Avenue, visit Five Points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9004)|
| 2:30:09| see those kind of things that are going on and the stuff that you guys are doing at the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9009)|
| 2:30:12| But I feel I've got to defend my district that I call a super district because of the diversity, because of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9012)|
| 2:30:19| because of the potential, because of the good things that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9019)|
| 2:30:23| We're building houses out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9023)|
| 2:30:24| We're paving streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9024)|
| 2:30:25| We're a lot better off than we were five or six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9025)|
| 2:30:28| So I want to get that on the record because you get out in the public domain that poor East Nassau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9028)|
| 2:30:33| and you can't go on the actual highway anywhere and there's crime and there's all this sort of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9033)|
| 2:30:38| Yes, there are problems, but there are great things about this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9038)|
| 2:30:40| And I think we do a disservice when we focus on if we don't get one project done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9040)|
| 2:30:45| or we don't get one little issue done, then this community is shot and nothing else good is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9045)|
| 2:30:50| There's a lot of great things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9050)|
| 2:30:51| There's a lot of organizations and churches that are doing really great things out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9051)|
| 2:30:55| and moving this community along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9055)|
| 2:30:56| Town Hall East for years has advocated for and done really great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9056)|
| 2:31:01| We've got new zoning out there, the R1, the new R1E9, EN1 that's done out there that's going to protect that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9061)|
| 2:31:10| And Sharon, you were a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9070)|
| 2:31:12| Those are very good things that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| So I've got to say I take a little exception to the implication that everything is just bad in East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9074)|
| 2:31:20| and we've got to do this one thing to make it all great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9080)|
| 2:31:23| This is one thing that if done correctly could help make it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9083)|
| 2:31:26| But we do have a great district, and I must say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9086)|
| 2:31:29| Also, I think that we've got to get the language right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9089)|
| 2:31:37| And I'm going to make a motion, and it's not going to be very popular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9097)|
| 2:31:40| that we do postpone for two weeks to allow the right language to be put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9100)|
| 2:31:45| the right deed restrictions to be put in if there is an agreement on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9105)|
| 2:31:48| I would hope that there could be a discussion, especially in light of what Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9108)|
| 2:31:53| Donaldson just said with regards to 101, the requirement of 101 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9113)|
| 2:31:59| Mr. Seymour is really hitting that, beating that drum really very heavily, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9119)|
| 2:32:03| as if that's a great benchmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9123)|
| 2:32:05| I think it's also an arbitrary benchmark that could be massaged that we can come down with maybe a time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9125)|
| 2:32:12| because I think Ms. O'Dell makes one very valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9132)|
| 2:32:15| If you stop at 100 units or 99 units, then the street stays open forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9135)|
| 2:32:21| And that's not acceptable, I think, on either side of what you are or the intent of your agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9141)|
| 2:32:26| which is to get it built out and to open and close that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9146)|
| 2:32:29| So I do think that, and I've heard in some of these discussions we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9149)|
| 2:32:33| that they figure four to five years or three to four years, you'll be done totally in building this thing out in phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9153)|
| 2:32:39| So my hope is that part of the discussion will not only embrace what you all are talking about now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9159)|
| 2:32:44| but will maybe put a time frame on it or put some caveats on it that says, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9164)|
| 2:32:48| if we don't go so far in so many years, that we will then close it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9168)|
| 2:32:52| That kind of thing will be brought into the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9172)|
| 2:32:55| I think you'll find that maybe the neighborhood will feel better, and I'll feel very comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9175)|
| 2:33:00| You know, I still struggle with some of the issues that even the neighborhood feels very comfortable about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9180)|
| 2:33:04| But I do want to see good development in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9184)|
| 2:33:07| So right now, so that you can hammer out these last few little prongs, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9187)|
| 2:33:11| that are sticking up with regards to locking this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9191)|
| 2:33:14| You know, and I think, I don't know if council would support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9194)|
| 2:33:17| but I'll make a motion that we postpone for two weeks with the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9197)|
| 2:33:19| And I don't mind sitting in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9199)|
| 2:33:21| Maybe I'm not a good person to sit in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| Maybe you all decide that, Ms. O'Dell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9203)|
| 2:33:25| Maybe you all do better without me in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9205)|
| 2:33:27| But that you all sit down and try to hammer out and address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9207)|
| 2:33:32| And the one that's still floating out there for me is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9212)|
| 2:33:34| can you pin down something that feels very comfortable for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9214)|
| 2:33:38| and at least myself that lets us know that if you stop at 99 or 100, not because you decide to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9218)|
| 2:33:44| but for whatever reason that East Burn will then be dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9224)|
| 2:33:48| and it's not open in perpetuity because we stopped at 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9228)|
| 2:33:51| So I make the motion that we postpone for two weeks to allow the board to just wrap up their discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9231)|
| 2:33:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9236)|
| 2:33:57| Ms. Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9237)|
| 2:33:58| Vice Mayor Brown, would you accept as a friendly amendment a request that they do an analysis on the boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9238)|
| 2:34:04| option with parallel parking, street parking on both sides of the boulevard as an option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9244)|
| 2:34:12| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9252)|
| 2:34:13| I was going to ask, but I didn't want to muddy the water since they were so close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9253)|
| 2:34:16| I was going to ask how did the discussion go about the boulevard and the parking issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9256)|
| 2:34:21| and maybe the parking going in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9261)|
| 2:34:23| But I didn't want to muddy the debate because they had seemed to come real close to how they could close East Burn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9263)|
| 2:34:29| But I don't mind that as a friendly amendment at all because I just didn't want to continue the running debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9269)|
| 2:34:34| because the parties came close with something here to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9274)|
| 2:34:37| What about that option and what about moving up the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9277)|
| 2:34:41| The second or the motion was fine with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| So the motion is to postpone for two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| encourage the parties to talk with the Mr. Hawkins' suggestion that the option of having the boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9285)|
| 2:34:52| with parallel parking on it incorporated be a part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9292)|
| 2:34:57| And a serious analysis be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9297)|
| 2:34:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9299)|
| 2:35:00| Will the property lay out with that work and without taking enough parking away that it hurts the church for their larger services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9300)|
| 2:35:06| Let me say one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9306)|
| 2:35:07| My hope is that parties will negotiate both sides in good faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9307)|
| 2:35:12| and not interpret any comments from council members tonight one way or the other as you think their votes in your favor or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9312)|
| 2:35:19| That's dangerous water to tread in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9319)|
| 2:35:21| You should move forward on good faith negotiations to try and work together, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9321)|
| 2:35:28| in this situation and not in anticipation of the comments that, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9328)|
| 2:35:31| I think we got this vote or we don't have that vote because that's very dangerous water to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9331)|
| 2:35:36| And just please remember there's, as I've always said, there's more that unites us than divides us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9336)|
| 2:35:41| And hopefully we can unite on this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9341)|
| 2:35:44| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9344)|
| 2:35:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9346)|
| 2:35:47| The motion is to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9347)|
| 2:35:48| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9348)|
| 2:35:50| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9350)|
| 2:35:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9352)|
| 2:35:53| Thank you very much for a good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9353)|
| 2:35:54| Thank you all for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9354)|
| 2:35:56| And we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080408?start=9356)|
