| 0:01:01| All members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=61)|
| 0:01:02| All right. Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=62)|
| 0:01:04| For tonight's devotional, we look to Commissioner Anders from the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=64)|
| 0:01:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=67)|
| 0:01:09| Obviously, I hold no degree in theology, but some of the teachings of Jesus Christ have led me most of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=69)|
| 0:01:20| And in Luke 10, verses 25, there's a time where Jesus is teaching multiple people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=80)|
| 0:01:27| But this so happens to be that someone who is an expert in the law, I guess a lawyer, asked him a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=87)|
| 0:01:33| He says, What is written in the law, he asked him, and how do you read it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| Jesus answered, Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=97)|
| 0:01:45| The lawyer then asked, You've answered correctly, do this and you will live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=105)|
| 0:01:51| But wanting to justify himself, to gain more, to make himself look smarter or to try to question Jesus, the guy says, Who is my neighbor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=111)|
| 0:02:02| So Jesus taught in a parable as he normally does, did at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=122)|
| 0:02:08| and he talked about the Good Samaritan, the man on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho who was beaten and robbed and laid there alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=128)|
| 0:02:16| And three people passed by him, a priest, a Levite, and a Samaritan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| And there's a lot of points to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| You know, the priest ignored him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| The Levite, who was supposed to be his friend, ignored him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| The Samaritan, who was ethically or I guess opposed to, is not supposed to be seen with the Jewish person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=149)|
| 0:02:41| And so most of us know the story that the Good Samaritan brought him, God put him in an inn and gave him money to pay for his room and take care of him for the next few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=161)|
| 0:02:51| And Jesus then asked, Which of these do you think proved to be the neighbor and the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| And the lawyer answered, The one who showed mercy to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| And then Jesus said, Go and do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| And I think that's, for today's time, that's a great story to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| There's many points that can be made from that, many sermons that can be preached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| But, you know, I think it's time for us to be Samaritans in an ugly world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| And so let's pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| Father, we thank you for today, and we thank you for the privilege that we have to serve a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| We do not take this role lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| And we are called by you to have mercy and love for those, even those that are different than us and don't agree with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=206)|
| 0:03:35| And help us to show that mercy and love that you show us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| I pray that you'll help us make decisions that are without prejudice, without malice tonight as we go do the county's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=220)|
| 0:03:47| I pray these things in your name. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| Commissioner Bussler, would you lead us in the pledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| Everybody stand, face the flag with the proper salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=239)|
| 0:04:07| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=247)|
| 0:04:18| Okay, thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| We've got several folks who want to speak at public forum tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| I'm also making, as we get to setting the agenda, I'll be making some minor tweaks to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| just from efficiency to get some things moved forward through tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| But first, at public forum, I'd like to recognize Chief Jerry Harnish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| Chief, if you could come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| And public forum rules, you're given up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=283)|
| 0:04:54| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| I'm Jerry Harnish, 1339 Grenoble Drive, and I'm the fire chief at Rural Metro Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| I won't need all five, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| But I do want to tell you your sons are home from the deployment to the pandemic in New York and New Jersey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| and they are well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| More importantly, there are many, many people in the city of New York and northern New Jersey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| whose impression of Knoxville and Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| comes from the 10 people that came from here to help them when we weren't sure how the pandemic would affect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=323)|
| 0:05:31| I'll tell you their names and who's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| and then I'm going to allow one of them to tell you what his experiences were in New York City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| and specifically camping out at the Bronx Zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| So our responders were Kevin Buckstein, James Naylor, John Dodson, Garrett Dobbs, Christopher McKay, Adam Dantzler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=343)|
| 0:05:53| Duane O'Dell, Logan Mathis, Jeremy Rood, and Thomas Mulholland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| Some of those are otherwise indisposed and not able to be with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| Mr. Buckstein, would you approach and tell the commission what your experiences were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=365)|
| 0:06:13| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| So I was one of the first boots on the ground out in New York as well as some of my coworkers over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=375)|
| 0:06:23| and I'd been out to New York several times before, and seeing an empty New York, empty Times Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=383)|
| 0:06:31| and nobody out was the first eerie sight that I saw out there in New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| Most of us were involved kind of behind the scenes at the operational level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| making sure the whole deployment went smoothly and all the ambulances were able to function as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=402)|
| 0:06:51| and get all the 911 calls and patients to the hospitals right away, quick, fast, and in a hurry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=411)|
| 0:07:00| and with the care that they needed and they expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| So it was quite an experience to say the least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| and to give it a little bit perspective on a day-to-day operational level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=429)|
| 0:07:18| the FDNY EMS typically ran about 3,400 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| When we initially got out there for the first month, they were running close to 7,000 calls on a given day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=443)|
| 0:07:30| so their call volume pretty much doubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| So that was part of my experience just trying to operationally handle keeping all the ambulances safe and effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=453)|
| 0:07:54| I know the commission has a number of items on its agenda, so we'll return the remainder of the time to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| Of course, the reason these young men were up there is that Global Medical Response, our parent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| is the prime contractor for FEMA during disasters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| So they frequently look to the guys on the fire side because of the experience that we have in handling major emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=488)|
| 0:08:16| So that was the purpose for the deployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| We're proud of what we did and glad to have these guys home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=503)|
| 0:08:37| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| Thank you, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| Next at public forum is Mr. Chris Davis from the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=522)|
| 0:08:50| Commissioners, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Appreciate Commissioner Jay bumping into me in the hallway, allowing me just a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| Hope you're all doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| As you know, it is a time of change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| COVID-19 is changing just to make sense change just about everything we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| And then on top of that, as you all know, as you approved back in the January meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| we have a new voting system that we are implementing and we are training all of our workers beginning June 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| and working all the way through the end of the month and into next month to train our election workers in small groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| to make sure that ultimately the election runs as smooth as it possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| I just want to bring a few things to your attention real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| Obviously, number one, as most of you know, hopefully all of you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| we will be utilizing paper ballots for the first time certainly in generations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| certainly in my era of voting, and I'm not a young man anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| So it's been a long time since we've used paper ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| And I think sometimes we hear the term we're going to be getting a new voting system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| and that's a little intimidating to folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| But as I was telling Commissioner Gill just a little while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| ultimately you're going to be handed a paper ballot and you're going to fill out a paper ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| and you're going to fill in the circles just like we did kindergarten, fifth grade, whatever it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| where you literally you fill it in, you look at your paper ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| that's your verification of the ballot that you want to cast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| and then you'll run it through a scanner and we'll have the paper back up there available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| We are, despite that, we are still working on providing open houses to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=612)|
| 0:10:19| to the media, to some select organizations to come out and see the new system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=619)|
| 0:10:25| see what we're doing, see how we're training our folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| and frankly, just to be blunt, see how easy it is to vote on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| I'm going to be honest with you, if you asked me three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| do you want to go to paper ballots, I didn't get all the hubbub,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| and I still don't, primarily because I trusted the machines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| and I'll go to my grave trusting those machines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| but with COVID-19 being what it is, the fact that we don't have to have individuals touching screens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| and touching machines, they can go in, they can hold their photo ID out and have a worker look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| they can take their application for ballot and trade it for a paper ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| they can take the pen that they bring in or we can provide them with one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| fill out their ballot, run it through the scanner, and they're out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| We think that once voters get used to this, it will be an easier process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| and that's our goal ultimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| Just a couple of the things I want to bring up real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| and once again, I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| Number one, I want to just let everybody know that we made a precinct change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| and I am loath to make precinct changes in an election year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| but because of COVID-19, we relocated Precinct 34,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| which was formerly at the Fountain City Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| This last Thursday, the Election Commission approved a move from the tiny Fountain City Library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| and that's certainly no knock on the Fountain City Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| I'm sure it's a great resource for the folks there in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| but the room that we voted in was very small, and we got complaints about it even before COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=700)|
| 0:11:47| So we are now moving about three-tenths of a mile away to Central High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| much more parking, much more space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| We feel good about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| I really have no intention of moving anything after August unless there is an absolute emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| but this is one we felt we had to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| A couple of things, and I'll be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| Number one, we are always looking for more workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| Anybody, if any of your constituents or any of your friends or neighbors or comrades or colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=727)|
| 0:12:13| or people you go to church with are interested in being an election worker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| please have them give us a call because we are looking to overstaff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| to make sure that we are fully staffing all of our polling places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| And number two, and I'm directing this not only at you, but at your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| and at everyone watching tonight, I am a huge, huge advocate of early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| I do not like people who wait until Election Day, and that's no offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| but Election Day is where all our problems occur because people get lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| They don't know where to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| They're not sure where they're supposed to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| They're not sure if they're registered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| I encourage you, we have 14 days of early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| We have three Saturdays in this election cycle with plenty of hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| and all of that information is available on our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| along with some other really good information and resources on how to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| in terms of not how to vote necessarily, but how the mechanisms of voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| and literally a video on how to use the voting machine, the scanner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| as well as sample ballots and early voting hours and that type of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| With that, I just want to thank all of you for the work you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| and thank you for your time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| Okay, Mr. Davis, we've got several questions here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| and I might add just to tag on, harking back to some of our past meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| I know that that upgrade to our systems, or a change to the system of paper voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| was at a pretty good value for the county taxpayers by all taking advantage of a state grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| that may have been even some pass-through monies to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| It was actually federal money, but yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| Yeah, so anyhow, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| In order of the lights that I saw, Smith, Carringer, Jay, and then Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| So, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| Chris, that was really good, but if you're going to replace Cliff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| you're going to have to come with more drama and theatrics next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| Noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| I'm not from there yet, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| The number of mail-in votes you've had so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| and do you have the staff to handle the anticipated number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| Well, I'll just give you a real quick background on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| Typically, a typical August election, we'll see somewhere between 800 and 1,000 absentee ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| This particular election, literally as of about 30 minutes ago, 45 minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| we had 5,500 ballot requests thus far, absentee requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| We're a little over halfway through the period where you can request one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| People can request one up through July 30, Thursday, one week prior to the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| And we are planning as though we're going to have 10,000 to 12,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| and that's kind of what I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| We obviously are going to have some space constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| Obviously, we're going to look at another room in the old courthouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| in addition to the one we're using now, and we are planning on staffing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| But that's also something we're looking for is people who might want to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| on an absentee ballot counting board if somebody's interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| Does that answer your question, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| And the number of poll workers that you need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| can you give us a number that you think you're going to need so that we can help promote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| I think the easy answer is as many as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| Because in a typical election, we'll staff, let's say for a typical August election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| we'll staff 550, 600 workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| Best case scenario, any election, we'll have 5 to 10 percent of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| who can't show up that day for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| I don't know what that percentage is going to be this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| We're in unknown waters here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| So we're staffing as though it's a presidential election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| and we're going to try and get up over 700, 800 if we can and then see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| Because ultimately, the other good thing about that is, let's just say for argument's sake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| 95 percent of my workers show up, they get experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| and hopefully they're ready for the October-November election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| All right, thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| Yes, I just want to say, so we're going to be using ink pens, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| Yes, ma'am, blue or black ink pens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| And I would also tell everybody at home, you can bring your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| If you choose, we can provide you with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| You'll drop it in a box on the way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| We'll sanitize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| We've got this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| Sanitize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Three minutes later, in theory, you can use it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| It's going to be a little bit longer for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| But people can bring their own as long as it is a blue or black ink pen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| And then I just wanted to say I think it was a great decision by the Election Commission and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| to move from Fountain City Library to Central High School for Day of Election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| And I will also tell you we're going to be posting signage at both facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| We'll be sending postcards to every registered voter in the precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| And, frankly, it's one of those that we probably should have done it a year or two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| but our hand was forced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| And it is a very small room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| And so no offense taken, you know, and I don't think anybody is questioning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| I think that is a great positive move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| So I just wanted to let you know I appreciate it, and I think the community does too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1010)|

| 0:16:52| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| Mr. Davis, about the absentee voting, I believe the state or I'm not sure if it was a ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1014)|
| 0:17:03| but the state allowed for people to ask for an absentee voting due to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| But I noticed on our absentee ballot that is not an option to pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| Is that something we're going to add or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| You mean on our absentee ballot request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| It actually is on our website if you'll look at reasons three and four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| The Davidson County Chancellor who made that decision on, I believe it was June the 11th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| was very specific in her language about what we would include on our absentee ballot request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| And if it doesn't pop up, you may need to hit refresh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| But it's not on the form itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| Oh, it's reasons three and four on the form that's on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| Hospitalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| I am seeing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| I just want to make sure it was on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| I appreciate this clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| Chris, you talked about the process, about the scanning the document, and you'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| the paper as verification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| Does the voter get to look at the computer as the accepted ballot and verify that, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| They basically, they get, you know, it's one of those things that back when we had a DRE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| or a touchscreen, one of the major complaints we had was, I don't have a paper receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| You literally get to hold what you just voted in your hand, look at it, make sure you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| good with it, run it through the scanner, and the screen will look very similar to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| it was on a DRE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| You'll see the waving American flag if you did it properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| If you overvoted on something, perhaps you voted two people in one race or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| like that, it'll kick it back out and say, you know, you can cast this as is, or you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| have a chance to change your ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| But once it drops into the ballot box and it's been scanned, you're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| I mean, if they scan it, do they look at the screen and accept what's on the screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| It doesn't show your ballot on the screen, if that's what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| So we're just assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| We're getting close to 10,000 ballots, maybe, absentee type ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| Perhaps a few more, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| We cannot count, or you cannot start counting those until all the polls are closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| That might be at 8 o'clock or it might be at 9 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| That's to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| No, we can actually start when the polls open on election day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| We can't start prior to that, which I wish we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| I had thought that there was a ruling that you couldn't count those until then, but you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| the expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| So that answers my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| We can't report them, I think maybe what you're thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| We can't report them until the polls close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| We can start counting them, and we will at 8 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| As soon as the polls open, we can start scanning and counting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| We just publish them until the polls close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| I guess the only point I would have made then would be that there would have been a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| of the results could be delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| It could have been delayed, but since you're counting those early, that's not a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| Well, the results very well could be delayed, Commissioner, primarily because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| like I say, even in a presidential election, we're counting 5,000, 6,000 absentee ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| Now we're going to be counting 10, 12, maybe 15, depending on what we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| So it could very well, and I've told everybody I've talked to the last couple of weeks, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| could very well stretch into a second day, and that's one of the hazards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| It's not a hazard, it's just a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| I would rather get it right than be in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| So those ballots will be hand-counted or scanned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| They'll be scanned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| They will be scanned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| Chris, could you outline the process of the people and resources you need to help count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| the absentee ballots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| You know, a typical election, we get six to eight absentee ballot counting board workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| and we try to balance that as best we can between Democrats and Republicans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| We're looking for 20 to 24, and we're getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| Just to be blunt, I'm looking for a few more Republicans because I'm being outweighed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| Democrats on the board right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| But, you know, anybody who is, you know, the kicker on working for the absentee ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| counting board is once you walk in that room, you can't leave, except to use the restroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| because you can't go out and, I'm just going to take half a day, or I'm going to go get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| a long lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| I mean, we're in there and we're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| We're working all the way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Thank you, Mr. Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Chris, what happens if somebody votes for, say, two U.S. Senator candidates, gets ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| to scan it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| How can they correct it if it's in ink?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| If it's in it, well, then they, you know, it'll, the machine will literally tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| you overvoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| You can cast it if you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| It's not going to count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Or you can pull your ballot back out, go to the table, get another ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| That's called a spoiled ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Get up to three under Tennessee state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| And then you can complete your ballot again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Chris, when I was working the 73rd Precinct, we had some people would come in and on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1304)|
| 0:21:51| registry, it would show that they had an absentee ballot that they had voted and that they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1311)|
| 0:21:58| complain that they did not vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| Are you going to take that on a fail-safe vote and count it, or how are you going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Basically, what you're referring to is someone will come into the polling place either on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| early voting or election day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| They're there to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| Their record will say ballot issued at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| We consider them to have been sent a ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| And in theory, it could be returned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| So that voter is going to fill out a provisional ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| And it may or may not count depending on the status of the ballot that we sent out gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| sent back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| We, for obvious purposes, can't let them vote as a regular paper ballot and run it through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| the scanner because then in theory, they could be voting twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| And the reason why I was asking that, sometimes we did it on a fail-safe, what we called a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| fail-safe back then, ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| And when it was going through, some of them had voted differently than they had on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| other ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| So which one do you count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Well, if it's ballot issued, we count that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| That one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1370)|

| 0:22:59| You have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| I actually texted your predecessor today about something unrelated to all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| Tell him to come back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| He seemed fairly relaxed when I talked to him on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| I'm sure he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1388)|

| 0:23:44| was a recruiter for Knoxville, he helped me so much in South Knoxville, helping me set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| up different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| He's one of the reasons I was able to reach 4,000 and 5,000 people that we recruited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| So I've got to give him his props for that because he really came and he helped me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| I want to make sure that we understand that how critical this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| As we got shut down in March, so when I come back in on this next session, I'm coming back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| as a supervisor because once we got ready to get started, they said, okay, shut it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| They just went back in the offices in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| The count will be beginning in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| The count is going to run all the way to the end of October 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| So the census has been pushed back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| The information I'm going to give you, I'm giving to you and I want you to go back into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1462)|

| 0:24:30| to make sure your areas are covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| A couple of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| The census is now an $800 billion census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| $800 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| You don't get counted and the same information I'm giving you, I've given you all a packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| You all should have this same packet that I'm giving you information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| Everyone in the audience online and in here can go online and get the same information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| and you need this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| When you go online for your particular areas, your zip codes that you represent, there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| now a response rate toolkit that you can go right down into your zip codes and see how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| your area is responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| Remember, everybody that you do not get counted in your area, you lose $2,000 per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| And to give you an example, nationwide we're right around 61%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| Tennessee, we're at 61%, 45% of that was online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| In Knoxville, one place I have to give props to, Farragut, is already 81%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1521)|
| 0:25:28| But there are certain zip codes and I can show you how to get your zip code and break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| it down to the census tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| Certain areas in Knoxville, even though we're at 61%, there are certain areas that are only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| at 21%, 25% in those areas that you represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| So you need this kit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| I know we've got a census count committee, but we need as a people, we need to be stepping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| up as we come back into the public and coming back together because this is money for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| This is your roads, our schools, our hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| We need to be counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| There are three sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| You all have them in your kit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| You have the advantage of already having it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| Everybody else can go online and get it at 2020census.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| But that response spot is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| The census is still hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| You still go to 2020census.gov forward slash jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| The census is still hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| They're still needing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| There is a spot to go on there to check your response rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| There is a spot to go on there, excuse me, to do it online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| People still don't want to come back into the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| So if you don't want to do that, all you got to go is my2020census.gov, and you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| the census online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| It is very critical that we, everybody gets counted because it's awful if you go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| a school system and it says, okay, you got 800 kids, but when you walk in there on school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| day, you got 1,300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| So you done lost $2,000 times those number of kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| So I just wanted to come before you and give you that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1612)|

| 0:28:11| and said he hadn't been too long, he had his surgery, but he came and sat down with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| sat with me the whole time, got on his phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| He was looking at calling people, you need to come down, people come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| Oh, Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| This is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| And he knew about his area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| He knew what he needed for his area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| So you, as the commissioners, if you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| So it could look like a special event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| You know, some of us have done as commissioners, it's like a evening with the commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| or you could even do like, I've got my friends in the school board and my friend from the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| the city council, like Andrew and all of us, you know, we've had events where we all came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| together for issues, but you could do a, just what you're saying is a thing that works that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| where we can use our, our, our volunteer jobs here on commission is to say, put on an event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| post it on your social media, say, hey, come by and see me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| I'll have, hey guys, if you've got any money in your campaign accounts, you can buy donuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| Come and see me here and get, and get your census stuff taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| That's kind of been what has worked best for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| Back to you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Thank you for coming, Ms. Vivian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Another good way is our South Knoxville Business Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| We're going to do internet setups to where churches will have an internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| They can come and do their census online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| We're going to do, if we ever get back to events in South Knoxville, we'll go with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1764)|
| 0:29:32| Wi-Fi hotspots where they can come up and do not only the census, but register to vote also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1772)|
| 0:29:38| So those are very, very productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| I found out real quickly that if you can get somewhere where people can come and you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| got the computer here, they will fill it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| Because there's still a lot of nervousness, even when we go back in in August, about you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| coming to their door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| It was already nervous before, but now with COVID, you know, people are really nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| So to be able to have a safe spot that you can come to and use that equipment or use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| your own, just bring your own equipment, like with the election thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| You ain't got to touch nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| Bring your own telephone, because you can do this on your own smartphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| You don't have to have a lot of fancy equipment or laptops or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| Bring your telephone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| But you've got to be counted, especially, for an example, in 2010, for some of the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1813)|
| 0:30:19| in, like, for example, in 2010, 800,000 African Americans were undercounted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| The majority of those were children under five years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| So when you look at that across the board for all children, if you don't count that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| newborn to that person that's 120 in your community, regardless, you are losing funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| that you need for your area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| And that money, once you have a guy to count it, it's a portion to set aside for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| Can't nobody use that money but you and your, for your district, your area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| So please, everybody go online, go to 2020census.gov, get the information you need, do your census| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| if you have not done it, and make a way to make sure everybody is counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| Moving down on our public forum, I've had a handful of guests who've signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| about 5G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| If y'all could raise your hands, if anybody's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| I've got Michelle and Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| You know, we do have an agenda item later in the meeting to actually talk about 5G that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1878)|
| 0:31:24| with Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| Would y'all like to be heard at the time when we get to that on our agenda, or would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| like to go right now, because we are going to be talking about it as a discussion item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| a little bit later in the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| Well, it kind of makes sense maybe to do it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| So, I mean, you can certainly go right now, but since we'll be talking about that a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| bit later, it makes sense to maybe handle that at that time, if that's all right with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| And I think one of the other folks who called, I think Laura wanted to speak about it, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| she was running late tonight, so it might work better for her anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| Next, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Constance Every.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Is Constance here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| I think that covers everything related to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| So, now we're going to move on to the part of our, and by the way, moving on, I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| to kind of take just a moment before I set the agenda to recognize our elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| I believe I see Mayor Jacobs in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| Mayor Jacobs, thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| I haven't heard from you, so unless you've got something that you'd like to say, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| let you chill back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| I saw Sheriff Spangler here tonight earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| So, Sheriff, you're still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| I saw Super Bob Thomas over here in the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| So, Bob, thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| And if there's anybody else, I'm sorry I missed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| Also, in case you're wondering, you know, we have not done a census-related shift into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1969)|
| 0:32:56| districts on the county commission, but we're trying to do our best to spread out the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| commissioners up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| So, hence, you've got everybody spread out just a little bit more up here on the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| I think the comment I heard related to Commissioner Biggs was, well, in school, you're used to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| getting set in the back row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| So, anyhow, so, anyhow, yeah, for not paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| But, so, thank you, everyone, for your patience on that and for spreading out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| So, now, we're at the point in the meeting tonight where we do officially set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| I'm going to go over the add, withdraws, and the non-consent items, and then we'll vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| I'm also going to use just a little bit of discretion and move one of the discussion items that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| had on the agenda for last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| The meeting went late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| We didn't get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| So, I'm going to move Mr. Green towards the top of the agenda so we can have that quickly and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| then move through the rest of the agenda because that was last, the work session went kind of late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| and we were going to cover that at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| So, the adds for tonight's agenda are items 32, 44, 46, and 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2030)|
| 0:34:07| That's 32, 44, 46, and 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| The withdraws were items 29 and 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2053)|
| 0:34:21| 29 and 40 were withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| The non-consent items were items 1, 2, 3, 4, 16, 19, 32, 44, 47, 48, and 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2064)|
| 0:34:45| Did I miss any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| It's more likely than not that I missed any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Yes, Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| What was that, the non-consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2092)|

| 0:35:15| Any changes or any other things that you'd like to see pulled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| We actually pushed through a lot of stuff at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| So, seeing none, I also want to make a clarification in case we've got someone here tonight who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| never attended a county commission meeting or if you're watching out through the internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| We have two county commission meetings each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| Usually, they're the third and fourth Mondays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| Last Monday, we had our county commission work session, and during that work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| we did our first pass through this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| During that meeting, quite a few of these items we did discuss at length, and many of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| those items were voted to be put on what's called a consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| What that means is tonight, there will be, for example, a lot of the school items and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| some of the general government-related business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| Those items will be read into the record, and we will then vote with one vote on all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| of those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| That avoids us needing to take a separate vote on every single item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| So, if they work through the work session, they've made it to the consent agenda for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| I have sent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| That is the proposed agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| Is there a motion for accepting that agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| We have that motion from Commissioner Daly and a second from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| All in favor of accepting the agenda, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| The agenda has been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| As I mentioned at the very beginning of the meeting, I'm going to go ahead and move Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| Green to the very first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| That was actually at the end of last week's work session, and we never had a chance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| So, Mr. Green, I'm going to go ahead and bring you forward to handle your item, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| you can have a lot of fun watching the rest of the meeting until we get the zoning tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| How does that sound?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2216)|
| 0:37:09| And for my fellow commissioners, this is something I know going back to pre-COVID, with all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2229)|
| 0:37:20| changes to the growth plans, everything now struck me as a time to just revisit how planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| could look in the future, and we've got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| You could almost call this maybe a swan song from Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| I know he's getting ready to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| I thought it would be helpful for this body and actually future commissioners, as I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| the body, when some of this work gets done, will be some different folks than some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| But for the record, I thought it would be a good idea for Gerald just to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| different options that this body may have to consider moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2268)|
| 0:37:56| Do you need me to get Zach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| I think I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2278)|

| 0:38:11| I'll put this off so I can speak a little more clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| Can everyone hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| It's a pleasure to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2296)|

| 0:38:32| And I say that because some of you, like Commissioner Jay, Commissioner Biggs, have gone since I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| been here, and I've really enjoyed getting to know you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2318)|

| 0:38:53| And that 2% may change from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| I want to, some of this you've seen previously at your, some of the basic information at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2338)|

| 0:39:48| The population growth in 1970 was a result of some annexations in the 1960s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2388)|

| 0:40:02| In 2010, the city started gaining population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| It gained about 10% of the county population between 2010 and 2017, or 2010 and 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2405)|

| 0:41:51| We've watched the development activity in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| The green is the pre-recession, and you see a very robust development activity in both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2515)|

| 0:42:43| The non-residential development still hasn't hit the pre-recession levels, and we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| of many factors for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| One is the decline of brick-and-mortar retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| I always ask folks who think that retail is the answer, how much of your Christmas shopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2574)|

| 0:43:07| do we deal with retail in Knox County in the coming years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2587)|

| 0:44:15| we're seeing a shift in the type of housing that's being developed in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| This map shows where that development is occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| The green is single-family, the orange is multifamily, and the blue is attached like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| condos, and the purple is mobile homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| And we'll see where in the county with the northwest and the southwest sectors being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| the primary locations for new residential development, and multifamily being primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| in the urban core of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2683)|
| 0:44:50| You can see that the bubble is getting bigger and bigger in the northwest and southwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| and starting to shift to just the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| Talk about development in Knox County following a clock starting at 6 o'clock and going up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| to 12 o'clock and now starting to move to 1 and 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2703)|
| 0:45:10| And we see that in terms of future population in Knox County and the region, Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| will continue to lead the region in population growth, accommodating just over 58% of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2714)|
| 0:45:22| regional population growth in the next 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| We see the region growing by over 330,000 over the next 50 years, and Knox County by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2725)|
| 0:45:33| over 190,000, which means that in the next 50 years there'll be another city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2733)|
| 0:45:40| in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| And I say that not in terms of density in a new city, but that number of people over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| the next 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| The public can expect the population to continue to grow, and there are some trends in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| underlying growth factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| Less migration, lower birth rate, and the dying off of baby boomers, as much as I hate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2755)|
| 0:46:02| to admit that, that will affect our population growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| And we've seen our population projections actually decrease over the past five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| as a result primarily of the lower migration rate to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2770)|
| 0:46:17| It appears that everyone who migrates from other states to Tennessee ends up in the Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| area, and that's a real strong detriment to places like Knox County, I think, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| have all the assets, but Nashville is attracting those people who moved to the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2788)|
| 0:46:38| We look at our projected housing need, how many homes we need to accommodate that new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| population by the year 2050.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| We'll need 240,000, a total of 240,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| We're at 202,000 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| That's a growth of about 40,000 new homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| That seems like a lot, but that's about, I've got my numbers here, about 1,300 new homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2816)|
| 0:47:02| a year, which is less than the number of homes that are being built now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| So we'll see a tapering off over the next 50 years in the number of residential units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| being built unless our population projections start growing up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2831)|
| 0:47:19| This is something we talk about, the changing preferences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| Why are there more people moving to the urban area of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| It's the preferences of the millennials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| They like the urban areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| They like the amenities of urban areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| They like the walkability, the downtown energy, the variety, and they like transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| options rather than just driving a car, a bus, bicycle, walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| We've got to address that as we look at the development of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| How can we provide these amenities in the county outside the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| When we look at the apartment boom in the city of Knoxville in the past five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| the permits for single-family homes have accounted for 56% of the total residential units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| with 44% being for multi-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2883)|
| 0:48:09| Our projected labor force in business over the next 30 years, we'll see that there's services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2889)|
| 0:48:14| employment, education will continue to be the dominant employment sectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| with manufacturing continuing to decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| And we see the projected number of business establishments growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2904)|
| 0:48:31| to accommodate the new residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| What we're seeing is projecting is we'll need about 13,000 businesses over the next 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2916)|
| 0:48:44| based on our average employment to provide employment for the new residents of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| That's about 430 businesses a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| And that's not to say one new business may hire 500 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| and accommodate all those people in that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| But on average, we would need 430 average businesses each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| to provide employment for the new residents of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| Just something to keep in mind that I know we don't think about a whole lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| when we see new subdivisions, but providing transportation and roads is expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| The cost to resurface a two-lane road is between $100,000 and $145,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| In 2019, Knox County accepted 15 miles of new subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| a 26-foot wide roadway to repave that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| That's a commitment of almost $2.2 million to repave those streets that Knox County accepted last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2975)|
| 0:49:42| So as we look at our growth, we also have to realize that the infrastructure that we're providing for that growth costs money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2982)|
| 0:49:49| How do we provide the infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| So we've got some significant questions to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| How do we accommodate the new development and the new residents that are coming to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| And how do we provide infrastructure without burdening our taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| and burdening the property owners and business people in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| One of the ways to do it is to provide for more density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3008)|
| 0:50:15| And we've often talked about town centers and community centers, where they can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| Looking at our sector plans, we've identified these mixed-use town center areas throughout Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| different sizes from large centers to small centers to rural crossroads and employment centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| So we've identified the locations for those, but we don't have the tools to enable them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| Our county zoning only allows residential development in a very few districts, and most of those have a size limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3038)|
| 0:50:46| The office business is the most prominent district that allows residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| The others are scattered few and far between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| And even in our residential districts, in the planned residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| there's a minimum acreage of 20 acres before you can have any non-residential as part of that planned residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3060)|
| 0:51:08| And then there are limits on the size, and a certain number of homes have to be built before the commercial can be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| So we need some new tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| We have one new planning tool that the commissioners adopted not too long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| That's planned development that allows a development plan to be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| and allows the county commission to waive the underlying use standards of that district to enable mixed uses within any district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3086)|
| 0:51:34| It is not based on the direction from county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| That tool is not available in the rural area, but it is in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3097)|
| 0:51:44| Opportunities for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| We need to amend our zoning ordinance to permit mixed use development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| and that based on any property of any size, we could, should we require a non-residential or residential mix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3109)|
| 0:51:58| what is the intensity of that mix, and make a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| We should make the review and approval process efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| We've often, in government, we make what we want to happen difficult and make what we don't want to happen easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3124)|
| 0:52:11| We need to reverse that and make it easy to do things that benefit the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| Opportunities for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| We need to revise the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| The urban growth boundary is over 20 years old and no longer accommodates the type of development that's occurring in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3141)|
| 0:52:28| It does not address the type of development that the people of Knox County want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| We need to revise that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| We need to provide the supporting data, the background analysis that enables us to make a wise decision on revising the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3154)|
| 0:52:43| And that data and support should be provided by a general plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| And then comes the fun part, a comprehensive update of the county zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| Every week, I think, Commissioner Jake challenges me with a new opportunity to try to find a way to enable something to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3172)|
| 0:53:01| that's not addressed by our county zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| And working with Steve Elliott is great, but we shouldn't be taking all our time trying to figure out how to get a round peg in a square hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3184)|
| 0:53:12| We need to accommodate the type of development that's occurring in Knox County that people want to do that is good for the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3192)|
| 0:53:20| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| All right. Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| I'm sure we'll have a handful of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| Chair recognizes Commissioner Biggs first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| Mr. Green, the main question I have is looking in other areas that are kind of our same size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3211)|
| 0:53:39| whenever we're going into multi-use development and things of that nature, are these on bus routes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| Are these on greenways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| Or what can we be doing now that would affect that in the next years to come that will make it easier on this board coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3226)|
| 0:53:56| One of the big things is what I mentioned here is updating our general plan and revising the growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3236)|
| 0:54:03| Part of that general plan, we need to look at our long-range transportation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| and think of where we want our major arterials that could accommodate bus routes or even van pools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| or even more single occupancy vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| Our greenway plan, our entire transportation plan should be linked to that general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| so that we provide that basic infrastructure to those areas we want to see develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| And just enlighten me, whenever we do update that, are we taking into consideration the expansion of Alco Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3270)|
| 0:54:37| and the new areas of the airport and things like that that will also drive stuff into the Knoxville area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3277)|
| 0:54:44| We need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| In fact, Commissioner Daley has sponsored a resolution that was adopted by the commission a few months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3285)|
| 0:54:53| to do an updated corridor plan for Alco Highway, and that's on the planning program for the coming fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3293)|
| 0:55:01| Okay. Thank you. I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| Thank you. Commissioner Skinmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| Would you make a copy of this PowerPoint available, at least to myself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| I don't know if anybody else is interested or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| We'll make it available to all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| And it will also go on the planning website on the community growth and development site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| that has a lot of information about development and growth of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| Make sure all the commissioners get a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| And I'll have the notes with it so you can review the notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| All right. Thank you. Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Director Green, first, congratulations on your retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| And, second, before COVID started, we had passed a resolution to do a corridor study of Western Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| and Oak Ridge Highway, and then everything seemed to shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| Where are we with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| That's on the work plan, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| And what we've decided to try to do is use our resources efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| We'll be doing sector plan updates this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| and those corridor plans will be a focus area of the sector plan updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| so we can try to kill two birds with one stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| Back to you, Commissioner Jay, and then to Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| Director Green, first, I just want to say thank you for all your hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| and your dedication to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| I know that you've been in a lot of really interesting discussions over your tenure here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3379)|
| 0:56:26| but you have also helped a lot of us through a lot of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| So I will commend you and your staff for always being available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| and always getting right back to us and using whatever tools you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| So, first, just thanks for your service, and I appreciate all that you've done for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| You're quite welcome. I've enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| Second of all, you're days, weeks, how many days away from retirement are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3406)|
| 0:56:52| After today, 13 working days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| On day 14, as not the director of our planning department and citizen ordinaire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3417)|
| 0:57:07| what's just one or two things that you would love to scream to the rooftops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| to your commissioners and the rest of the citizens in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| seeing all that you've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| and knowing all that you know about what's coming in our growing community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| I guess what comes to mind is I heard it first in a song by George Harrison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| but I realized he copied it from somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| But if you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| Figure out where you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| Decide where you're going as a county, and then take that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| There will be curves and twists and U-turns in that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| but at least you'll know where you're going and you'll get there in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| But I think we all act, we don't know where we're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| so we just take the first road that comes to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| Thank you, Commissioner J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3472)|
| 0:57:53| Director Green, I hope I'm in that 98%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| You are, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| You'll never slip out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| There are a few people who are on the borderline and slip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| It has been an honor working with you. It really has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| This is a question that may come from maybe a question to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| What's the outlook for your replacement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| Is that in the process, Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| Do you want to answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| I'll try to answer it, and the mayor can correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| One thing, I've become very humble in my career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| and I get used to being corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| But Amy Brooks, who has been planning services manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| will be interim director for some time, Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| They search and do a nationwide search for a director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| You'll do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| You'll do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| You'll do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3519)|
| 0:58:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| And it seems as if your tenure was about four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| How many years has it been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| Five, yeah, because it, as I recall, you started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| and shortly thereafter, I know my wave of commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| we came into office shortly after you'd been hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| So, in a way, we've all kind of worked and grown together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| So, I've really enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| I remember the very first time after I was in office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| I spent some time with you, and that really helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| Moving on, we're going to get back to our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| So, Madam Clerk, let's start working through some of these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| So, the first item on our agenda is we need to approve the minutes of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| So, if I could have a motion in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3563)|

| 0:59:29| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| Were they good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=3570)|

| 1:14:51| kind of some of the community input, and then also some of his input, and then we have looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4491)|
| 1:15:00| at cost and feasibility at a lot of our parks and looking at certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4500)|

| 1:15:13| would be a huge addition to our park system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4513)|

| 1:17:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| This is, if you recall, we had the candidates for these seats came before this body last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4659)|
| 1:17:43| week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| I know that there's some folks who may be here in the audience or folks who may be watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| this meeting online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| These is where the County Commissioner fulfills our obligation to appoint people to boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4668)|
| 1:17:53| I'm going to very, very briefly hit the rules and process on how votes like this are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4673)|
| 1:18:00| As you all recall, there are four open slots for this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| There are three people who are currently serving on that board who would like to be reappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| All three of those did speak to us last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| Then we have three folks who have not previously served on that board who would like to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| appointed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| So we have six total candidates for, it looks like four total seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4699)|
| 1:18:26| And however, we are not going to show any preference for some of the folks who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| served in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| We're going to follow our normal protocol for board appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| It's in great detail on page five in the Knox County Commission rules, but basically for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| those of you at home and as a refresher, we're going to go around the room for nominations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| to get all names on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| We will then have a roll call vote, assuming, for example, if we get, let's say we get six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4727)|
| 1:18:54| people nominated in the first round and there are six names and then you have everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| gets a vote, the person at the end of the first round of voting who has the fewest votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| for that particular seat will drop out of consideration and will go through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| for each one of these seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| For the sake of clarity and my own sanity, I'm calling them seats one, two, three, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4751)|
| 1:19:17| four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Shouldn't be too complicated there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| And we'll proceed with the voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| I know Madam Clerk is already prepared with multiple pages of roll call tabulation sheets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4761)|
| 1:19:27| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| What the first thing we'll do is open up the floor for, excuse me, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4769)|
| 1:19:35| And also in our rules of procedure, can we not, can the district commissioners not nominate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4775)|
| 1:19:42| somebody from their district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4782)|

| 1:19:55| we'll start and go around for nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| And Commissioner Bailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=4799)|

| 1:26:46| So now we'll go around starting, I believe Commissioner Carringer did it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| So we will now go forward with putting names forward for consideration for seat two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| Yes, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| Is it possible to take all five names that are in balance and just accept those four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| What I could accept would be if someone wanted to, I think our rules are really clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| I'd really rather, I just want to be fair to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| I mean, because, yep, we're going to go around it and put the names back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| I hate to say it, but that's the way we've always done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| And if we start changing it, it would be more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| But I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| We want it to be fresh every time, out of fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| One of our fellow commissioners, even though we had a sitting commissioner get put in that seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| one of our commissioners may have a bone to pick and may want somebody who hasn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| who's been in that seat for a long time, maybe they want to change it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| I'd rather just roll with the process, run the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| So with that said, Madam Clerk, begin the nominations for the seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=5258)|

| 1:35:02| on to a final vote between Engle and Wood, if that's the desire of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=5702)|

| 1:46:40| between the stairs on the levels that we will occupy? I don't think we will. It's quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6400)|
| 1:46:45| expensive to do the stairs. They're paying for the whole cost of it. I was just, in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6405)|
| 1:46:51| stupid sort of way, I was sort of trying to be humorous, but they really are going, doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6411)|
| 1:46:56| building a stairwell between floors. I think particularly, and I don't mean to, they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6416)|
| 1:47:02| to provide better access between a couple of the floors to provide better flow, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| I don't think that any of the design work we've been looking at for any of the floors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| to be used by the Board of Education would involve internal stairwells. But it's sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6430)|
| 1:47:15| of a running joke in my law firm because we did that in our building in Nashville many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| many years ago, and it turned out to be about ten times more expensive than we expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| to try to go through concrete and to go through things. So I wish them luck as they tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| to do this. So my only question was that wouldn't impact the capacity to move safely between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6447)|
| 1:47:33| buildings? No, not at all. Not at all. In fact, it won't affect our being able to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6453)|
| 1:47:37| in and get in there in any way, and the construction period is not extended. Okay. That was where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| I was going. Yes. Thank you. Commissioner Skinmaker. Thank you. Don't leave yet. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6462)|
| 1:47:48| not going. If these agreements are approved tonight, what is then the next procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6468)|
| 1:47:54| The next procedure, we, well, the next procedure is we'd love to close both, we've not signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6474)|
| 1:48:01| documents with TVA. We wanted, they weren't contingent on this, but this certainly, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6481)|
| 1:48:07| think, makes everyone feel a whole lot better that basically we have a great subtenant and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| it's really going to be a much more predictable financial transaction for the county. So TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6491)|
| 1:48:17| is really, really wanting to close on July 1st if we can make that happen. We have title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6497)|
| 1:48:22| to update. We have some things that I need to satisfy to meet the law department's requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6502)|
| 1:48:27| I believe we might be able to be ready for July 1st, but it's going to be pushing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| and I told them that, but I do think in the first 10 days of July, we would be in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6511)|
| 1:48:36| to close this. I believe that UT now has all their approvals. They have gone through a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6516)|
| 1:48:41| long series of approvals at the state level. You know, I talked a little bit about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| John, and that, so that it would, I'm very happy, hopefully, if you all will approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6525)|
| 1:48:50| this, because if they made changes, they would have to go back to the state to get them reapproved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6530)|
| 1:48:55| at various levels. So I think that our goal would be to try to close both transactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6535)|
| 1:49:00| in the first half of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| Okay. And then UT has not signed any documents at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| No, no. If you all approve this tonight, unless there's some step that I'm not aware of at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6546)|
| 1:49:15| UT's level, this is the last public approval that's needed to move forward with this transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6555)|
| 1:49:21| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| All right. Thank you. All right. That motion is properly before us. Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6563)|
| 1:49:29| Okay. All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6571)|
| 1:49:32| All opposed, please say nay. Okay. The ayes have it. All right. Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6572)|
| 1:49:39| Item number 49, discussion item regarding 5G cellular towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6579)|
| 1:49:52| Okay. I'm going to look a little bit to Commissioner Baylor. I know we went over this at our work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6592)|
| 1:49:58| session, that this really does sort of fall under her view of the Cable Television Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| at least as a cousin, but we've also had a few folks who did want to weigh in at public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| forum tonight, and the poor things have probably had to wait through the meeting to get here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6607)|
| 1:50:12| but I'd like to give them, if it's okay with Commissioner Baylor, a chance to speak at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| public forum, and then if you want to talk to this briefly and, you know, some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| next steps moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6619)|
| 1:50:20| Yeah, absolutely. We do want to give the folks a chance to talk. Commissioner Jay and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6620)|
| 1:50:25| who chair and vice chair the Cable TV Committee, we are scheduled to meet July 20th, and actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6625)|
| 1:50:33| have Drusilla checking on a larger venue than we were going to meet in the Commission conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6633)|
| 1:50:38| room, but that's, we don't think the public will be very well accommodated there. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6638)|
| 1:50:43| meeting later this week not to discuss 5G, but to discuss the agenda for that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| and our intent is to add 5G as a discussion item at the Cable TV Committee, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6648)|
| 1:50:52| All right, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6652)|
| 1:50:53| I think public forum is in order now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6653)|
| 1:50:56| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| So, on that note, I'm going to go, we've got Michelle Bradford and Chris Zoni, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6658)|
| 1:51:05| if I pronounced that right, and then Laura Squires, I know have all expressed an interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| in speaking on this item, so Michelle, if you're here, you're the first one to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6668)|
| 1:51:14| in on that, so if you could please approach the podium and state your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6674)|
| 1:51:19| for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6679)|
| 1:51:20| Hi, my name is Michelle Bradford, we live at, well, my husband and four kids, we live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6680)|
| 1:51:33| at 7310 Bennington Drive, and I've been learning about EMF and the biological effects from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6693)|
| 1:51:41| it for about the past five years, and since this past fall, I've been learning about 5G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6701)|
| 1:51:47| and I've just had a lot of concerns about it on many levels, beyond just the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6707)|
| 1:51:51| effects, and I just have a passion to inform others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| I hate deception, there's just so much misinformation going on, and citizens need to know, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6715)|
| 1:52:03| be informed, and get to speak how they feel about some really big changes that are supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6723)|
| 1:52:09| to be coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| So, just a couple quotes real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| President Thomas Jefferson said, whenever the people are well informed, they can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| trusted with their own government, that whenever things get so far wrong, as to attract their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6738)|
| 1:52:23| notice, they may be relied on to set them to rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| And in 1765, President John Adams said, liberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6747)|
| 1:52:33| among the people who have a right and a desire to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6753)|
| 1:52:38| So, I was able to watch the video from last week, and so I know they share a lot of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6758)|
| 1:52:43| science behind the health concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| I won't go much further into that, I just want to also mention that, though each person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6765)|
| 1:52:50| has their own threshold for developing symptoms from EMF exposure, man-made EMF exposure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6770)|
| 1:52:56| based on various factors, the decades of independent studies on ionizing microwave radiation show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6776)|
| 1:53:02| harm to the biological system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| So, though certain people in the world will notice those effects sooner, it will eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6784)|
| 1:53:10| impact everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| The big health hazard of 5G will be the constant 4G signals at close range, because the 4G| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6792)|
| 1:53:20| is supposed to be the backbone to the 5G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| It's going to require way more 4G for the 5G to work, and that's actually a definite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6802)|
| 1:53:28| concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6808)|
| 1:53:29| We already have plenty of studies showing the harm of that, of 4G, and that would run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6809)|
| 1:53:35| 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6815)|
| 1:53:36| It goes through buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| 5G doesn't go through buildings, but the 4G does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| The 5G antennas are beam-forming at the millimeter waves, and they will only go to the devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6821)|
| 1:53:48| that are 5G compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| So, you can avoid some of that by not having the 5G compatible devices, but you can avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| the 4G increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| So, is that my time left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6838)|
| 1:54:03| Wow, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6845)|
| 1:54:06| So, although we do not yet have published studies on the biological effects of 5G, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6846)|
| 1:54:12| is the drastic increase of 4G frequencies that are a definite concern, based on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6852)|
| 1:54:17| studies we do have on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| So, one question I have is, does our city have ordinances in place to protect the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6859)|
| 1:54:26| of Knox County citizens that we can work with to amend the House Bill 2279?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6866)|
| 1:54:35| I'm not aware of what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| I know you had mentioned city ordinance, so I can't reference any city ordinances with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6877)|
| 1:54:41| the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6882)|
| 1:54:43| Do you know how we could go about putting some ordinances in place to, what health ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6883)|
| 1:54:50| to protect the health of Knox County citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| I don't understand politics much at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| This is the first issue that has brought me to want to start working with local government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| I think this is really just a great first step, and I know that most of the folks who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| brought this to our attention mentioned that there's some legislation in Nashville that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| they wanted to influence, and our partners in Nashville just got out of session about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| a few days ago, and I know that these are all some first steps in terms of educating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6914)|
| 1:55:19| this body as well as trying to get the ball rolling on maybe helping educate the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6919)|
| 1:55:23| in Nashville if they wanted to amend the Tassar legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| So I think that, at least based on the first few folks who have spoken to us, that's kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| of one of the goals that they wanted to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6934)|
| 1:55:35| So I have way more I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| Go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| So, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6940)|
| 1:55:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6948)|
| 1:55:49| Elon Musk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| Most people probably know he is sending 60 more 5G satellites into our ionosphere tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6951)|
| 1:55:59| and he is also quoted urging the merging of man with machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6959)|
| 1:56:06| 5G is just going to be foundational to such a different world that most people don't realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6966)|
| 1:56:13| that is trying to be implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6973)|
| 1:56:19| So, I know that there are actually some people in the world who do want a sci-fi type future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6979)|
| 1:56:28| and most people, once informed about what 5G is going to bring, are strongly opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6988)|
| 1:56:35| I realize that the technocratic plans, which have actually been in place for decades, will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=6995)|
| 1:56:40| most likely eventually happen at some point in this world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7000)|
| 1:56:44| So even if we can't stop it completely, we can at least severely slow it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7004)|
| 1:56:52| Go ahead and finish, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| We're just glad you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7014)|
| 1:56:55| But we do have to have some guardrails to keep the meetings from going crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| To all of our friends who I know are here for the planning commission, we'll let them finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7018)|
| 1:57:03| Then we're going to take about a 10-minute recess, and then we'll probably start the zoning about 10 minutes later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7023)|
| 1:57:08| But go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7028)|
| 1:57:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7029)|
| 1:57:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| So, I'm going to go ahead and say this next thing that could possibly discredit other things I've said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7035)|
| 1:57:24| but I'll take that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| I know that it has been kind of socially shamed to make a connection between 5G and COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7046)|
| 1:57:35| But just as you could say that's conspiracy theory, because a theory is something that hasn't yet been proven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7055)|
| 1:57:41| you could also say it's theory that it is not connected, because that has not been proven either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7061)|
| 1:57:49| And so, with the chance that there is a connection, which I feel strongly that there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7069)|
| 1:57:55| do we want to take that risk in our county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7075)|
| 1:58:02| Also, just to paraphrase of Plato, basically that tyranny first appears as a protector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7082)|
| 1:58:09| So, just regarding the many changes that are being suggested under the guise of protecting people from COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7089)|
| 1:58:16| and actually there's just so much deception going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7096)|
| 1:58:22| how much of that is really about establishing 5G and it being blamed on COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7102)|
| 1:58:31| the symptoms of 5G being blamed on COVID-19, and 5G continuing to be implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7111)|
| 1:58:40| which will lead to people probably heard of the New World Order for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7120)|
| 1:58:45| I remember hearing of it when I was a kid and it seemed like total conspiracy theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7125)|
| 1:58:49| But each generation, it moves a little closer to that, and we are just really close at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7129)|
| 1:58:57| with the technology in place and the money behind it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7137)|
| 1:59:03| So, I don't know any of you personally, but I would guess that many of you, maybe all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7143)|
| 1:59:09| believe in the Lord and know God's word, and so I've just thought of this parallel to the story of Esther| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7149)|
| 1:59:16| and just people in positions of power being similar to King Xerxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7156)|
| 1:59:22| citizens wanting to inform people in positions of power, similar to Esther's role in that story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7162)|
| 1:59:31| Haman, of course, I wouldn't say people in telecom industry because they may not fully realize what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7171)|
| 1:59:38| But it's just more dangerous than most people realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7178)|
| 1:59:44| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| And the last thing is just all that is hidden will one day be revealed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| and we are just each responsible to do what is right in God's sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| All right. Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| All right. Commissioner Skidmaker, do you have a follow-up question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| Ms. Bradford, two years ago when I was involved in some of the legislation for the 5G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7200)|
| 2:00:08| when it was going to be done on a local level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| it's my understanding that the federal government has forbidden local entities from any kind of health categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7210)|
| 2:00:22| In other words, they've got immunity from any kind of health requirements in cities and counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7222)|
| 2:00:29| So I've heard – oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| Go ahead. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7231)|
| 2:00:32| I've heard that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7232)|
| 2:00:33| And so Attorney Andrew Campanelli, he's handled over 7,000 cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7233)|
| 2:00:39| most of them concerning the telecom industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| He says that misinformation is one of telecom's main tools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| and he explained that telecom companies are going to the FCC for interpretive orders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7246)|
| 2:00:54| and then the site builders are going to local governments and saying that they can't do anything about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7254)|
| 2:01:01| their hands are tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| And local governments are believing some of that, and it's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7263)|
| 2:01:10| I don't know fully what House Bill 2279 is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7270)|
| 2:01:14| I haven't looked fully into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| If that is an exception for us now where our hands are tied, I don't –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7275)|
| 2:01:20| but if that could be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7280)|
| 2:01:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7285)|
| 2:01:26| It's my understanding that they've got immunity from the federal government as far as from the cellular providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7286)|
| 2:01:34| but I think the House bill that you're talking about, it's more of placement size aesthetics, those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7294)|
| 2:01:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7303)|
| 2:01:44| And notification process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7304)|
| 2:01:47| But anyways, that's – we'll be discussing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| And I do want to – we've got – when we have that cable meeting in a few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7309)|
| 2:01:54| that will be a chance where both the politics and all of this stuff can all kind of come together for a more focused vetting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7314)|
| 2:01:59| so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7319)|
| 2:02:00| So as I said, we do need to get through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| A couple of more speakers who wanted to speak on this briefly, then we're going to take a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7323)|
| 2:02:08| we have another meeting that's supposed to start at 7, two minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7328)|
| 2:02:11| So we – and I want to get to that one quickly, but also in fairness to the other guests who are here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7331)|
| 2:02:17| I do want to give them a chance to speak on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7337)|
| 2:02:19| So – and then we'll be moving – brief break, and then on to land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7339)|
| 2:02:23| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| Thank you, Ms. Bradford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7345)|
| 2:02:28| Chris Zanoni.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| And Chris, if I mispronounce your last name, forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7350)|
| 2:02:33| But when you come to the podium, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7353)|
| 2:02:40| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7360)|
| 2:02:41| I have a handout for each of the 11 commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7361)|
| 2:02:44| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7365)|
| 2:02:56| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7376)|
| 2:02:57| My name is Chris Zanoni, and I live at 1829 Granada Boulevard, Knoxville, 37922,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7377)|
| 2:03:03| the bluegrass area of West Knoxville, District 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| Thank you for the opportunity to address you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7387)|
| 2:03:10| And thank you, commissioners, for how you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7390)|
| 2:03:14| and are working diligently on behalf of Knox County citizens to protect them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7394)|
| 2:03:21| and also to protect the wonderful community we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7401)|
| 2:03:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7404)|
| 2:03:26| As a follow-up of last Monday's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7406)|
| 2:03:29| I want to thank you again for appointing Commissioner Buehler to lead additional review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7409)|
| 2:03:33| regarding the 5G situation in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| We are asking the commissioners, state representatives, state senators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7417)|
| 2:03:41| and Governor Bill Lee to repeal and replace HB 2279| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7421)|
| 2:03:46| in order to protect the property values, health and safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7426)|
| 2:03:49| and privacy of Knox County citizens from an unregulated telecommunications industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7429)|
| 2:03:57| and harmful non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7437)|
| 2:04:01| We are asking for a halt on any further 5G installations until it can be proven safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7441)|
| 2:04:08| For that purpose and to assist our commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| I would like to humbly submit a sample 5G legislative code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7450)|
| 2:04:15| to protect Knox County citizens from small cell antenna installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7455)|
| 2:04:20| That is the handout that you have in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7460)|
| 2:04:25| The first set of pages in the handout is a sample 5G legislative code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7465)|
| 2:04:30| The purpose is to assist the county attorney to update Knox County's code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7470)|
| 2:04:36| in order to protect property values, privacy, safety, and public health to our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7476)|
| 2:04:43| Following the blue insert is a link to thousands of independent peer-reviewed studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7483)|
| 2:04:48| which document adverse biological effects associated with exposure to wireless radiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7488)|
| 2:04:55| And the next page quotes wireless companies admitting potential liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7495)|
| 2:05:00| from exposure to electromagnetic radiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| And the last page is a survey by the National Institute for Science, Law, and Public Policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7504)|

| 2:06:59| But again, if you would like to have a tower stuck in front of your home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7619)|
