| 2:28:21| and you've been down there and ran two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8901)|
| 2:28:24| Y'all been talking about this chronic homeless for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8904)|
| 2:28:27| Y'all sit there and gave Volunteers of America all that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8907)|
| 2:28:30| Y'all finish sitting down, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8910)|
| 2:28:31| Gave them all that money to build that new facility over on Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8911)|
| 2:28:36| and when they did, they stopped taking care of the doggone homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8916)|
| 2:28:39| like they were when they was here on Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8919)|
| 2:28:42| Y'all invented that problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8922)|
| 2:28:45| because, one, when y'all gave them the taxpayers' money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8925)|
| 2:28:49| to help them build that place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8929)|
| 2:28:51| y'all should have ensured that they were going to take care of the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8931)|
| 2:28:54| Shoot, now everybody's over getting a nice paycheck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| and a brand-new building on taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8936)|
| 2:29:00| You know, Mr. Woodall, you did all right tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| I already know Mr. Frost, he wanted that doggone audience to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8942)|
| 2:29:05| because it's in his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| He never did want nothing down there on Broadway to do with the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8947)|
| 2:29:12| He wanted to clean up the whole place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8952)|
| 2:29:14| I hope they come over and camp out on his sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8954)|
| 2:29:18| It would be fine by me, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8958)|
| 2:29:20| I need you to come and clean up Hazen again, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8960)|
| 2:29:23| They're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| They must have got out of jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8965)|
| 2:29:26| They're all back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8966)|
| 2:29:27| So we need to come down on Clifford and Hazen and clean it up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8967)|
| 2:29:31| And that's all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8971)|
| 2:29:32| Well, Ms. Murphy, good luck being governor, old man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8972)|
| 2:29:35| Just don't take Dr. Lyons with you because I disagree with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8975)|
| 2:29:39| because you should have did a victor ask and did some annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8979)|
| 2:29:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8983)|
| 2:29:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| Stole my sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8987)|
| 2:29:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8989)|
| 2:29:50| Next is Jeremy Spears or Spires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8990)|
| 2:29:55| Me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8995)|
| 2:29:56| Spears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8996)|
| 2:29:57| Sorry, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8997)|
| 2:29:58| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8998)|
| 2:29:59| My name is Jeremy Spears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8999)|
| 2:30:00| My address is 3500 Sutherland Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9000)|
| 2:30:06| Hang up my phone there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9006)|
| 2:30:14| Mayor and members of the council, I've never come up here to a council meeting before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9014)|
| 2:30:18| but I watch you guys lots of times on public access, so somebody does watch periodically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9018)|
| 2:30:23| I'm a full-time student at the University of Tennessee, nontraditional student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9023)|
| 2:30:28| I've got a wife and three daughters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9028)|
| 2:30:31| Two of them are over here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| My wife is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| A lot of the people sitting over here are here for the same reason I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9035)|
| 2:30:39| Sixty-five years ago, there was a place here in Knoxville, before the Civil Rights Movement started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9039)|
| 2:30:44| where there was a baseball diamond, and Ms. Peeland is where I'm going with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9044)|
| 2:30:50| where a baseball diamond where black people, white people, people of all color were welcome to come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9050)|
| 2:30:57| played on teams together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9057)|
| 2:30:59| I believe one team was all black members with one white member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9059)|
| 2:31:02| People sat on the sidewalk together, sat down and ate picnic lunches together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9062)|
| 2:31:06| Today, that place is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9066)|
| 2:31:08| It's not a baseball diamond anymore, but the spirit of diversity that was there before the Civil Rights Movement still exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9068)|
| 2:31:14| That place is the Sutherland Village, the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9074)|
| 2:31:19| I'm here tonight, and the other people that are here, and they're going to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9079)|
| 2:31:24| for the simple reason of bringing to this council's attention that nobody over there that I can find,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9084)|
| 2:31:32| nobody in the neighborhood, none of the residents, no one agrees with the destruction of Sutherland Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9092)|
| 2:31:37| As a student at the University of Tennessee, I've been living there for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9097)|
| 2:31:41| Will probably live there for at least, either until I tear it open or another two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9101)|
| 2:31:46| tear it down another two years, regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9106)|
| 2:31:49| There seems to me no logical reason for what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9109)|
| 2:31:52| And I'm off my notes here, but you may ask why I'm bringing this to the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9112)|
| 2:31:56| The reason we're bringing this to the city council is because the university has made it very clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9116)|
| 2:32:00| that they are not going to respond to the business, businesses in the area, the businessmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9120)|
| 2:32:04| They're not responding to the neighbors that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9124)|
| 2:32:07| They're not responding to our community in any way to our request to continue to have an adult student housing facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9127)|
| 2:32:13| here in Knoxville that does what this one does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9133)|
| 2:32:20| I could speak right now on a lot of different issues, diversity, the benefits, the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9140)|
| 2:32:26| but the one that I want to address right now is particularly from a business angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9146)|
| 2:32:30| I've talked a lot to the business owners in the area and talked a lot to the different people that work around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9150)|
| 2:32:36| We've talked to everybody from Earth Fair to the Sutherland Market to the Holy Land Deli to the Oriental Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9156)|
| 2:32:44| These people are going to be very, very badly hurt if that property is destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9164)|
| 2:32:48| And if they replace that with a baseball diamond, it's a rugby field that nobody is likely to use anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9168)|
| 2:32:53| I say this as a student who has used facilities at the University of Tennessee, who lives there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9173)|
| 2:32:59| I use T-Rex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9179)|
| 2:33:01| Despite the way I look, I do use some of the sports facilities there from time to time for different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9181)|
| 2:33:07| We don't see the sense of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9187)|
| 2:33:11| There will be, for the city, directly affected, there will be a loss of tax and licensing revenue if this is destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9191)|
| 2:33:19| There's no doubt, Mayor Haslam, you guys have a pilot station right across the street from where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9199)|
| 2:33:24| that is definitely going to be directly affected by what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9204)|
| 2:33:28| You're going to lose business licensing, which isn't a lot in this city, but you're going to lose some of that revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9208)|
| 2:33:34| You're going to lose tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9214)|
| 2:33:36| You're looking at decreased sales tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9216)|
| 2:33:38| You're looking at a potential increase in crime in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9218)|
| 2:33:41| You're looking at increased necessity for police resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9221)|
| 2:33:44| You're also looking at, in the future, when the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9224)|
| 2:33:47| who borrowed a million dollars from housing last year because of the profits that are being made on those apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9227)|
| 2:33:52| turns around next year and says, we need a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9232)|
| 2:33:55| You're going to have to come to the taxpayers or raise tuition for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9235)|
| 2:33:58| We know right now that no one in the neighborhood sees the logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9238)|
| 2:34:03| The responses that I've gotten from anyone in that community, just no one understands it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9243)|
| 2:34:08| The businesses have not been consulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9248)|
| 2:34:10| Meetings have been called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9250)|
| 2:34:11| They've met at the Pond Gap Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9251)|
| 2:34:14| Pond Gap, the whole situation at the elementary school, you're looking at losing 10 percent of the students that are at Pond Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9254)|
| 2:34:21| And that, of course, means decreased revenues there as well as the diversity issues in that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9261)|
| 2:34:27| We know that the community doesn't really get anything in return from what's expected to be happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9267)|
| 2:34:32| Probably going to have increased problems and decreased businesses, decreased property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9272)|
| 2:34:36| In return, they're going to get a baseball diamond with lights on late at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9276)|
| 2:34:39| And if anybody's there, probably noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9279)|
| 2:34:41| And then after the lights go off, no telling what will happen unless they have police patrols down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9281)|
| 2:34:46| Thirty more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9286)|
| 2:34:47| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9287)|
| 2:34:48| The cost of renovations is going to be lower than what they've said so far, which doesn't really apply to you guys, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9288)|
| 2:34:54| What we don't know is why the community was not consulted on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9294)|
| 2:34:58| We don't know why that the statistics and the dollar amounts on this have not been made public whenever they've been requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9298)|
| 2:35:05| And what we really would like to know and we can't believe is why a great city like Knoxville would be willing to see a place that is this diverse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9305)|
| 2:35:11| that's family oriented as this place is, community supported, community centered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9311)|
| 2:35:15| and why they would allow this to be destroyed without any sort of whisper of dissent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9315)|
| 2:35:21| We would like to see the city do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9321)|
| 2:35:24| We don't know what you guys can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9324)|
| 2:35:25| I know that some of you all have some pull in the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9325)|
| 2:35:28| I know that some of you all, of course, the city of Knoxville has to work with the university on zoning ordinance and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9328)|
| 2:35:34| We're fully prepared as a group of students to fight all the way to the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9334)|
| 2:35:38| If it means that we have to fight the zoning changes, if it means we have to have protests, whatever we're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9338)|
| 2:35:44| we would like to see a continued student presence there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9344)|
| 2:35:47| Mayor Haslam, can I say just one thing real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9347)|
| 2:35:50| I don't really have a dog in this fight, in a manner of speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9350)|
| 2:35:53| I could leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9353)|
| 2:35:55| I've lived all up and down the East Coast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9355)|
| 2:35:57| When I get done next year, I could leave and go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9357)|
| 2:36:00| But I have friends and I have acquaintances and I've made friends in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9360)|
| 2:36:04| I've made friends with the business owners that are going to be strongly affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9364)|
| 2:36:07| And I strongly urge the city to do something in its power, anything in its power, to stop this from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9367)|
| 2:36:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9372)|
| 2:36:14| I was going to say, Mr. Spears, you realize it's owned by the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9374)|
| 2:36:20| which the city of Knoxville certainly does not pretend to control and dictate what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9380)|
| 2:36:25| I just wanted to make sure you all understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9385)|
| 2:36:27| Even if the city wanted to do exactly what you wanted, the state could let it go in one ear and out the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9387)|
| 2:36:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9393)|
| 2:36:34| We do understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9394)|
| 2:36:35| And we are actually pursuing this at the state level as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9395)|
| 2:36:37| And David Williams from Pond Gap Community Association has been pursuing it at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9397)|
| 2:36:42| So we believe this is a really good forum locally to let our voices be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9402)|
| 2:36:47| and let everyone in the community know what's going on and do what we can to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9407)|
| 2:36:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9411)|
| 2:36:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9412)|
| 2:36:53| Jason Ammons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9413)|
| 2:36:55| Did you all want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9415)|
| 2:36:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9416)|
| 2:36:57| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9417)|
| 2:36:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9418)|
| 2:36:59| I wanted to respond to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9419)|
| 2:37:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9420)|
| 2:37:01| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9421)|
| 2:37:02| Certainly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9422)|
| 2:37:03| Well, you're all going to speak on the same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9423)|
| 2:37:05| Maybe it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9425)|
| 2:37:06| But I just wanted to say that I represent the first council district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9426)|
| 2:37:11| which includes not this area but the majority of the university campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9431)|
| 2:37:14| And it also includes what used to be university housing in a similar fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9434)|
| 2:37:20| There were two married student, et cetera, housing developments there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9440)|
| 2:37:25| that had been there for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9445)|
| 2:37:27| And we tried and tried and tried to negotiate something with the university| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9447)|
| 2:37:32| where there would be some determination of the disposition of those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9452)|
| 2:37:36| after the university gave up ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9456)|
| 2:37:40| We were not successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9460)|
| 2:37:42| Ms. Bell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9462)|
| 2:37:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9463)|
| 2:37:44| You feel you haven't been engaged or had an opportunity to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9464)|
| 2:37:47| That, of course, is the area which I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9467)|
| 2:37:51| I've been very involved in discussions with the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9471)|
| 2:37:55| with the neighborhood associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9475)|
| 2:37:58| Mr. Williams is president of a small group there at Pine Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9478)|
| 2:38:03| But the Bearden Council has been very engaged with the neighborhood associations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9483)|
| 2:38:08| and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9488)|
| 2:38:10| But the Bearden Council has been very engaged with Dr. Stoner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9490)|
| 2:38:15| who is in charge of student housing, from the get-go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9495)|
| 2:38:19| from the very first inkling that these apartments were going to not be replaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9499)|
| 2:38:25| or restored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9505)|
| 2:38:27| So it has been, as Councilman Hoffman says, a very discouraging discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9507)|
| 2:38:33| I think the university has made its determination of how it wants to handle that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9513)|
| 2:38:39| which they, of course, have a right to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9519)|
| 2:38:42| But at the same time, there have been a lot of discussions about how this is going to affect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9522)|
| 2:38:49| particularly those businesses along that corridor of Sutherland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9529)|
| 2:38:54| where we've made so many accomplishments recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9534)|
| 2:38:58| and how that community, which really celebrates diversity, as you expressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9538)|
| 2:39:06| which is so important to that Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9546)|
| 2:39:09| So I'm sorry that you all personally have not been in contact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9549)|
| 2:39:13| because I don't recall seeing you all at the Pine Gap meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9553)|
| 2:39:15| or any of the other public meetings we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9555)|
| 2:39:19| But if you'll get in touch with me, I'll be – excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9559)|
| 2:39:23| Go ahead. I was going to ask her to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9563)|
| 2:39:25| Well, I just didn't recall seeing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9565)|
| 2:39:27| If you were there, forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9567)|
| 2:39:29| But we had another meeting that evening, and I was there for an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9569)|
| 2:39:32| an hour and a half, and had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9572)|
| 2:39:34| But I just want you to know that there is a great deal of concern on the part of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9574)|
| 2:39:40| and on the part of this district council member, and I'm sure all of this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9580)|
| 2:39:46| about how that is going to affect that area and that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9586)|
| 2:39:50| and those of you who enjoy that excellent opportunity to live in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9590)|
| 2:39:58| So I'd be happy to engage you all in discussion further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9598)|
| 2:40:02| and to have you sit down with the university officials here who have made that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9602)|
| 2:40:10| And I feel that the university has been well represented in terms of their decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9610)|
| 2:40:16| and the numbers that are involved, the difficulties they have with some of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9616)|
| 2:40:22| because of the age and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9622)|
| 2:40:24| So I just don't want you to feel that you have been carved out of the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9624)|
| 2:40:29| to hear those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9629)|
| 2:40:31| Actually, this is not really supposed to be for dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9631)|
| 2:40:34| Public forum is supposed to be for presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9634)|
| 2:40:36| Well, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9636)|
| 2:40:38| You have plenty of chance to talk to Ms. Pilo or let anybody who wants to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9638)|
| 2:40:41| but just kind of the way this process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9641)|
| 2:40:45| Jason Ammons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9645)|
| 2:40:47| Jason Ammons, 3700 Sutherland Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9647)|
| 2:40:53| Mayor, members of the council, I'll try to make this brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9653)|
| 2:40:56| I know it's late, and I'm a little nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9656)|
| 2:40:58| So I, too, am an untraditional student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9658)|
| 2:41:03| I just started attending classes again in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9663)|
| 2:41:07| I went to the University of Tennessee during the late 90s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9667)|
| 2:41:10| and then after the bombing of the coal, I went to the U.S. Navy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9670)|
| 2:41:14| I served in the Navy for eight years in Yokosuka, Japan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9674)|
| 2:41:18| I'm an Iraqi veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9678)|
| 2:41:20| We did a whole lot of deployments, especially after September 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9680)|
| 2:41:24| My wife is Japanese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9684)|
| 2:41:26| It was a big step to get out of the Navy and come back to Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9686)|
| 2:41:30| but I think it was best for our son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9690)|
| 2:41:32| I have a 3-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9692)|
| 2:41:35| My wife loves Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9695)|
| 2:41:37| I'm sure you're all pretty happy to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9697)|
| 2:41:39| She hated McMinn County where we were living for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9699)|
| 2:41:42| My son learned how to say cow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9702)|
| 2:41:44| That was about the best thing that came out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9704)|
| 2:41:46| But she loves Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| And part of the reason that she loves Knoxville is the dynamic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9708)|
| 2:41:51| beautiful community that we live in, and if they close it down, that's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9711)|
| 2:41:57| You'll never see anything else like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9717)|
| 2:42:00| My son is 937, so my wife probably drug him in about 20 minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9720)|
| 2:42:05| He likes to stay up late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9725)|
| 2:42:07| But he was probably playing with the Libyan kids from upstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9727)|
| 2:42:11| the Chinese kid that lives right across from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9731)|
| 2:42:14| and then maybe the Indian kid from over, I think, in C Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9734)|
| 2:42:18| So you can't find that anywhere else in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9738)|
| 2:42:21| We've already talked about the small business issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9741)|
| 2:42:23| Holy Land Deli, gosh, that's a great deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9743)|
| 2:42:27| And that guy is mad that it's closing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9747)|
| 2:42:30| Earth Fair, Kroger's, all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9750)|
| 2:42:34| I know there's not a whole lot maybe you guys can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9754)|
| 2:42:37| I mean, we just want to make it an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9757)|
| 2:42:39| Maybe you can bring something to the table or at least a little bit of influence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9759)|
| 2:42:43| I invite you all to please come down to Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9763)|
| 2:42:46| I mean, normally we have a great cricket game going over there in the evenings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9766)|
| 2:42:50| but those are some of our best players right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9770)|
| 2:42:53| So it probably didn't happen tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9773)|
| 2:42:54| But you're not going to find that anywhere else in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9774)|
| 2:42:58| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9778)|
| 2:42:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9779)|
| 2:43:00| And I didn't mean to cut you off in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9780)|
| 2:43:02| It's just we have public forums kind of meant to be a presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9782)|
| 2:43:05| and not to be set up for dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9785)|
| 2:43:07| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9787)|
| 2:43:08| That being all the business to come before Council, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9788)|
| 2:43:10| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9790)|
| 2:43:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=9820)|
