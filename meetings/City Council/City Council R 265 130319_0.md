| 0:02:07| report, I just wanted to again remind everyone that this Saturday is the Neighborhood Conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=127)|
| 0:02:14| It's at the Convention Center. It will be, it will run from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. A lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=134)|
| 0:02:21| great workshops that are scheduled. There will be more than 20 information booths from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| both city and county agencies and non-profit groups. We've actually closed pre-registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| I understand we have something like 540 individuals, the city and county, that have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=151)|
| 0:02:38| Apparently, you can still come on Saturday, but there won't be a lunch for you. So if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=158)|
| 0:02:46| at the last minute you decide you're not pre-registered, you can still come. But, well, we won't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| lunch for you there. But the sessions will still be open. So David Massey came two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=171)|
| 0:02:57| ago to our meeting and talked about that and it should be very good. I know council's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| to be there as well. And most of us, I think all of the city department heads. So we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| all be there to talk and to learn. Let's see. I also want to congratulate our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=187)|
| 0:03:13| We recently celebrated some service milestones with the city of Knoxville. Last week, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=193)|
| 0:03:19| honored 38 retirees and about another 65 employees who had 20 years or more. We actually had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=199)|
| 0:03:26| six with 40 years of service and one with 45. So we appreciate, of course, our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=206)|
| 0:03:33| and the hard work that they do for the citizens of Knoxville. Tomorrow, Mayor Burchett and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| Farragut Mayor Ralph McGill and I will participate in Mayors for Meals Day, working with Mobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| Meals to try and raise some more awareness about that. We all know how great that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| is in serving our seniors. So we thank CAC for this opportunity. And finally, I'll see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| any of you tomorrow. We're going to start our budget hearings for the city. And I start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=239)|
| 0:04:06| meeting with each department one-on-one to talk about how their operating budget is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| and what their requests are for the coming year. Of course, it's always open to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| and of course to council if you can be there. That is the end of my report. Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=256)|
| 0:04:24| Thank you, Madam Mayor. I'd like to first off, on a personal note, welcome Nolan Askew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| as my guest this evening. He is the Student Council President at Moreland Heights Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| School and he invited me to their meeting last Friday and so I tit-for-tat and had him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| tonight. So I want to welcome him and his father John is in the audience as well. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| welcome to the council meeting. You're welcome. And I just wanted to say that I'll be having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=287)|
| 0:04:54| my quarterly Coffee with the Councilman Saturday the 30th from 9 to 11 at the World Famous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| Roundup Restaurant. World Famous? Come by. Thank you. Mayor Brown. Yes, Mayor, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| you. During my moments I would like to recognize with approval of council and yourself Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| Bud Nolan who is here to tell us about the Senior Softball League. You should be throwing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=311)|
| 0:05:20| out a pitch to him. Nothing over 100 miles an hour. At my age I don't travel that fast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=320)|
| 0:05:29| anymore. Honorable Mayor and City Council Members, I'm here today with this other group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=329)|
| 0:05:36| of people here out of 70 that we have in the Senior Softball Organization, not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| ask for anything but to give you a little praise and thanksgiving for all the support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| you've given us since 08 in the form of using Caswell Park to use our seniors to play softball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=346)|
| 0:05:56| Now softball as you might think about it as a senior doesn't represent too much. There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| are some of us that play pretty good, but others don't. But our league is made up of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| 70 people, ladies 55 and plus, men 70 plus, and we also take handicaps. But we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=367)|
| 0:06:18| unique system in where we don't play softball the regular way. We play it like you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| it. We use the bases and the ball and the bat, but we have no umpires, no arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=384)|
| 0:06:31| We have no balls or strikes. We don't have any innings as such. We put together these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=391)|
| 0:06:41| folks for health, recreation, and fun. And they all play on teams, but we also allocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=401)|
| 0:06:52| the ladies into the teams so they are balanced. We play like 13 seniors to a team, and when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=412)|
| 0:07:02| the last 13th player has made an out, as we call it, you can't strike out, you can't foul| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=422)|
| 0:07:10| out, you can't do those things. You have to hit the ball and you have to run to first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| base. There's a reason for that. Sometimes we give an alternative to those that can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| run to first base, but otherwise, we're trying to do this for health, recreation, and fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=440)|
| 0:07:27| Now the praise we give you is that back in 08, when Mayor Haslam was here, and we presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=447)|
| 0:07:36| this program to him, he saw it fit and he thought really, he got behind it 100%. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| he said, I tell you what, we're going to give you Caswell Park to play on, and it won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| cost you anything except the $10 for their insurance, and so it's been that way ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| since. So we praise you folks all for continuing that support for these folks, and we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| like for you to come out and watch us, and to come out and to play. So we waive the age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| limit, I'm sure most of you are under that, for playing with us. So that's because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=483)|
| 0:08:11| your support and so forth. Now while I'm talking in the interest of time, I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| to introduce one of the ladies in here that represents all the players, and she also is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| a special events person that's going to make you a member of our organization by giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| you one of these pins that I got on my hat. So Dimple Thompson, if you don't mind coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| up here and making these people a member. Now Dimple is unique in the sense when she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| came to us in 2008, she didn't even play softball or know anything about it, and now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| is one of those trusted players and is one of the managers for the organization. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| 18 volunteers as managers to run this organization, and it's been running well ever since 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=527)|
| 0:08:56| So we just come here today to give you thanks and praise for your continued support of letting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=536)|
| 0:09:02| us use Haswell Park for all these seniors. Now one of your members is closer to us than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=542)|
| 0:09:09| you might realize. That's Dan. Dan came to us when he was mayor, and he came to our potluck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=549)|
| 0:09:18| dinner and liked it so much he keeps coming. So anyhow, Dan became a member with us, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=558)|
| 0:09:25| he's been out there just cheering us on. So we praise you folks for all this, and we'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| just like to thank you for that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Bud. Thanks for offering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=570)|
| 0:09:39| this program to our seniors, and you know, I played with them a couple years ago, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| I was eligible. And I still am, so I will. Yeah, I'm going to come back out and play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=584)|
| 0:09:51| with you again. I enjoy softball. Thanks for being here. Let's see. Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=591)|
| 0:09:59| Thank you, Mayor. I have a couple of announcements. First, I want to mention and make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| this concerns the Lions View Pike KUV project, and I just want to be sure that people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| aware that there's a public meeting on March 21st at 6 p.m., and that will be at Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=610)|

| 0:13:23| Vice Mayor Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| If I could ask the Council if I could have the ability to move forward Ordinance 12G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=805)|
| 0:13:37| I don't believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| Yes, 12G, that's the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=821)|

| 0:13:47| So there's a motion to suspend the rules to move 12G up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=829)|

| 0:14:13| and donating same to Legacy Parks Foundation to be utilized toward certain initiatives to help South Knoxville businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| Vice Mayor Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| You go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| You know, we had the announcement a week ago, I believe it was, about the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=871)|
| 0:14:39| Dr. Lyons and Eddie Maness and the mayor and I have been talking and conversing about what we could do to help the Urban Wilderness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=879)|
| 0:14:49| Arts and Trade District with the, you know, recent announcement that they're delaying the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| And with very thoughtful and thorough deliberation, we came up with the idea to have Legacy Parks act as the fiscal agent for $20,000 to help promote this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=894)|
| 0:15:09| People are asking me exactly what are we doing, but we haven't defined that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| But what we are going to do is listen to the merchants and help them guide, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| the process because they're the ones that are being affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| We've got several members of the Urban Wilderness, Arts and Trade District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| If you'd stand up, please, just for recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| I want to say this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| This, you know, it could have been very easy for these folks to kick the dirt and woe is me, but they've not done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=931)|
| 0:15:39| They fought and organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| We meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| Our meetings are getting larger and larger and larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| And at the end of the day, the silver lining to this is that when that bridge reopens, you know, and before, we're going to be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=946)|
| 0:15:53| And, you know, we're going to face this head on, and I think the county is also going to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| And I'm glad to say I was in Nashville today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| Joe Armstrong was able to get the first leg of getting a caption bill out of the subcommittee to receive help from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=961)|
| 0:16:11| I can't find yet exactly what that help from the state will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| but Senator Massey and Representative Armstrong are working very hard for South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=974)|
| 0:16:21| and particularly this affected area to get some state help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| You've already got city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| You'll have county and then state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| So that's government really working for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| So, you know, I'm just really happy and, of course, obviously urge council to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=991)|
| 0:16:38| I'm sure you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| It's a great cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| It's going to people who deserve it and businesses that are really suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| It's about saving jobs and economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| So I'm just really happy that we're able to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| And thank you, Vice Mayor Pavlis, and thanks for your leadership on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| When I talked to Carol Evans about whether Legacy Parks Foundation would be able to be the fiscal agent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| the recipient of these funds, you know, it made sense because for the urban wilderness to be strong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| it needs support services, it needs businesses that are there to serve the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1029)|
| 0:17:16| that will be coming to the urban wilderness in South Knoxville and all the amenities that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| and that we are continuing to build and preserve there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| So this is going to be a great partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| I know they're already involved with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| And so we will, the first part of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| is to put together a plan on how to best promote the urban wilderness arts and trade district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1054)|
| 0:17:40| and that will be the first order of business that Legacy Parks will be working with the merchants on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| So thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| And is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| Councilman DelVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| I just wanted to ask Councilman Pavlis, is South Knoxville open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| South Knoxville is open for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| You can go to www.SouthKnoxIsOpen.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| I think Ms. Hussain would like to have a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| Thank you for giving me just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| Yes, on behalf of the Urban Wilderness Arts and Trade District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| I'd like to thank all of you, especially Mayor O'Hara and Nick Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| I always say Nick because we see him regularly at our meetings and we're very appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| But I can say on behalf of all of us, we were very surprised and impressed with this action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1100)|
| 0:18:28| because sometimes in the last two years it has just felt like talk and a lot of, oh, we're sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1108)|
| 0:18:35| So this came at a point when it was just a really critical juncture for all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| and being very frustrated by the extension of time and to see something concrete happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| And I know that it was a decision all of you all were a part of in the moment of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| So we really are appreciative and eager to, like I said before, get around a table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| and make a plan of the way to use this money in the best possible way to help all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1134)|
| 0:19:00| And that is our intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| And we're on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| You want to mention South Fest while you have the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| Yes, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| Yes, so please, all come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| There's a plan in the works right now to have something that is called South Fest on April 12th and 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1150)|
| 0:19:18| This will involve several different activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| It's going to be in the main two parking areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| It will be in the Disc Exchange and We Care Shop parking lot, down in Emory's parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| and maybe another couple of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| It will have all kinds of activities for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| There's supposed to be fire engines, like 4 to 8 on Friday the 12th, 10 to 4 on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1172)|
| 0:19:40| We'll have merchants that are not in that vicinity that will be coming out to set up tables to promote their business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| to share with people what is actually out in this area that you may not realize exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| That we, by the way, as business owners who came together after the bridge closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| were stunned at the amount of different businesses that are in our area that we didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| I mean, literally, we didn't know until we started getting out and digging around a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| It's an amazing array of unique businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| So that will be happening April 12th and 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| And kudos to Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| He's been very instrumental in this festival coming up, and he's shown great leadership in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1211)|
| 0:20:20| And just on behalf of the business, I want to say that working with our business owners has been a great privilege for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| because it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| And when we sit in our meetings, somebody will say something, and the rest of us, even though we're business owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| will go, oh, what a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| And so we kind of feed off each other this kind of mentality as being entrepreneurs or self-employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| It's pretty unique and really exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| So we're working hard and trying to say we want to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| We want to project not until the end of the year, but 5, 10, 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| We're doing this because we want to continue to be in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| And this, we believe, will help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| Thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Also, I just want to do thanks to Public Works and Engineering Department for getting out the signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| the detour signs off of James White Parkway and leading you through town across the Gay Street Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1260)|
| 0:21:07| and over to the North Chapman Business District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| Those look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| I've noticed them as I'm driving around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| I had a point that week to go drive the route just because I do use it regularly, and I noticed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| And I mentioned it to Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| I was like, the signs look awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1281)|

| 0:26:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| I would like to ask Jim York to come up and talk just a moment about this, really to explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| how these figures are arrived at and to explain the importance of this stream of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| Jim York, finance director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| This is the payment in lieu of taxes for the electrical and gas divisions of KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1590)|
| 0:26:38| This is actually set by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| It's a fairly complicated formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| There are two parts to both of these electrical and gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| One is basically the plant and inventory and equipment for KUB in each of these jurisdictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1608)|
| 0:26:59| and that's why you'll see multiple jurisdictions because KUB has plant equipment in all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1619)|
| 0:27:05| these jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Part two is a piece that's based on total operating revenue, less purchase power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| And for that, the city receives 77.5 percent of the part two distributions on electrical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1632)|
| 0:27:26| and 100 percent of the distributions on gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| In addition to this, KUB will also make a payment in lieu of tax for water and wastewater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| The total amount that the city will actually receive is about $14.2 million, a little less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| And KUB is actually probably the largest single taxpayer inside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| So I'll be happy to answer any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| So that $14 million is not reflected as part of this $8.6 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| Again, water and wastewater, we don't need a resolution to do those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Well, we may have already covered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| I see Mark Walker is here from KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| If you have something to add, we are thrilled when you come here to give the taxpayers money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| and help pay the bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| So, Mark, if you've got something you want to add to that, we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| Mark Walker, CFO of KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| Appreciate the opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| I think Mr. York pretty much covered it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| He did a good description of how the amounts are calculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| I'll just add that in total, the $14.2 million, that does represent an increase of $720,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1712)|
| 0:28:39| or about 5.5% over last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| So that's pretty much in line with the historical growth, maybe a little bit higher than the historical average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1722)|
| 0:28:49| If I could ask one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Mark, are you still working on looking at refinancing some of the bonded debt that KUB has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1730)|
| 0:28:56| Because you've been before us before telling us how you found ways to save money in terms of interest money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| that KUB would have to pay on some fairly sizable loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| We are continuing to look at opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| I will point out that I know KUB came to council last November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| and requested approval for refunding of $144 million in bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| Council graciously approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| We sold those bonds in early February, and we received very positive rates on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| In fact, we'll achieve a debt service savings of about $25 million over the life of the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| So we're very appreciative to council for approving that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| But going forward, we'll continue to look for refunding opportunities in concert with our financial advisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| And based upon our last conversation, we hope to find some in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| Happy hunting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| Thank you, Mr. Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| 11G, a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| for the transfer of surplus city property being one decommissioned Ford pickup truck for a total price of $3,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1803)|
| 0:30:11| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| 11H, a resolution to approve the sale of two vacant city-owned parcels of surplus property to William Dunn for the sum of $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1820)|
| 0:30:32| Okay, we have some people who have signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| There are three folks signed up against it and one person for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| So we'll start with those who I guess are for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| Bill Dunn, if you would like to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1847)|
| 0:30:54| And if Council rules are, state your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| I'm familiar with those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| I thought you might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| My name is William Dunn, known as Bill Dunn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| I live at 5309 LaVesta Road, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| I appreciate the mayor and the council for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| I know what you go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| The reason I'm interested in these lots, it comes from a neighborhood watch meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| My son's in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| He started the neighborhood watch and continues to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| I thought it was great for neighbors to get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| I started looking around, saying, wouldn't it be great to have a community garden where we could gather?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| And this vacant land is down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| I grew up in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| I know the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| I know the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| My dad served on the task force that worked with the city on this property, so I'm very aware of what has gone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1896)|
| 0:31:44| The city did a lot of due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| They took months to look at it to make sure that the engineers signed off, that there would be no harm to the sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| And they came back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| But before I put a bid in on it, I went to talk to the neighbor, the lady who lives next to it, Miss Rogers, if you'd raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1914)|
| 0:32:01| And she was very gracious, said she'd love to have me as a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| And on Saturday, when I went back to her and said, well, it's going to be Tuesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| I just want to make sure you still have me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| She said, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| And she said, and I'll come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| Since that time, I've spoken to the other neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| I have a petition that I sent to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| Every single person I spoke to signed it saying they're not opposed to a garden there or my purchase of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| So I really think it's not really a neighborhood issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| It really comes down to risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| And since there is a sinkhole there and since there's a history, that does cause some people concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| Driving here from Nashville, I kind of had one of those V8 moments where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| why didn't I Google what should be the buffer between a sinkhole and a garden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| So I called somebody, and they looked it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| And on the USDA site, it talks about a 25-foot minimum buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| Now, obviously, it could be more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| But anybody who's been to the lot knows that there's 150 feet of grass from the sinkhole lip to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1973)|
| 0:33:01| Then there is a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| Then there's a ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| And so there's a massive buffer between where a garden would be and where the sinkhole is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1985)|
| 0:33:12| And Miss Rogers, who's lived there for 20 years or so, has said that whenever it does flood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| she has not seen this particular property flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| We had record rain in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| And some of the council members who went and looked at the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| they could see the high water mark from where debris was left from that January incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| I've got a degree in agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| I understand soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| I understand erosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| When I worked with the UT Extension Service, I actually did a program on sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| So I understand how they work and what can cause them to fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| I think the key word here is incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| I have an incentive not to lose any topsoil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| And I'm talking about I don't want to lose any soil from the garden to get on another part of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| I don't want it to leave at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| And there's things you can do to keep it in the garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| So I have an incentive to make sure the sinkhole doesn't fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| It doesn't do me any good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| It doesn't do me any good as a gardener to lose any soil, even if it never makes it to the sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| Mr. Hagerman there, I've read his report, and I think there's a key line in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| The second to the last paragraph, the last line says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| a garden on this site would likely be an insignificant contributor of sediment or chemical contamination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2063)|
| 0:34:30| compared to many continuing and potential activities within the residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| Now, I think a lot of people are focusing on this garden, on this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| There's a lot of stuff, if I understand this report, there's a whole lot of stuff that really is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| And I know in Nashville with bills and stuff, people said, well, isn't it possible this could happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| There's possibility, there's probability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| It's possible that Elvis lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| It's not very probable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| And I think that's when we weigh this, what is possible, what is probable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| And I'll tell you what is actually happening is there are trees dropping leaves in the sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| The city has just planted 20 trees down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| You kind of wonder where the leaves are going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| There is trash down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| There are limbs that gather on the containers over the sinkhole walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| There are four-wheelers that are going around the sinkhole tearing up the soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| That is what is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| Now, I have an incentive to make sure that that trash gets picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| I have an incentive to remove branches that are right now forming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| Sorry, you have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| And bottom line, by me purchasing that property, the city gets a watchdog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2135)|
| 0:35:42| And the funny thing is I'm paying for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| I would appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| Madam Mayor, if I could, I'd like to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| I mean, I want to hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| I want to hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| All of our speakers need to tell us what their concerns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| So what's your pleasure for the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| Let's give him another three minutes and see if that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| Without objection, we'll give him three more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| Continue, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| In that 30 seconds, I went right to the punch line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| All right, back up an inch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| Well, I could name other things that you see going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| I mean, there's kids that live in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| and they like to build forts and ditches and do that kind of stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| and throw rocks down into holes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| A neighbor could throw his grass clippings down in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| So like I said, I've got an incentive to make sure things that are actually happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| stop happening, which helps preserve the sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| Everybody benefits from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| So that was the main thing because I think it's risk that's looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| So what I could say to you, some people are saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| what is the risk of that garden being there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| What's it going to cost the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| I could throw back, what would be the risk if you reject this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| and you don't have a watchdog who's going to actually take care of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| that are going on in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| And that's all I'd like to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Any questions you may have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Unless he's going to come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| Do you want to go ahead and ask questions now or hear from everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| and then ask the questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| We can hear from everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| Don't go far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| Okay, we have three folks that are signed up against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| If you all want to move towards the microphone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| John Roach, Jamie Rowe, and Carleen Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| And I know you three all know the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| Our former law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| How long ago was that, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| Oh, longer than I care to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| Actually, well, for the record, I'm John Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| I live at 722 Chiawa Circle in Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2262)|
| 0:37:49| I was the law director when this property was purchased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| and I think that's why I got invited to come tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| And so there's two or three points that my clients would like me to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2279)|
| 0:38:06| Number one, I think there are three questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| One, is this property truly surplus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| Secondly, is the proposed use an appropriate use in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| And thirdly, what liability might the property owner have who ends up with this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2299)|
| 0:38:29| From the standpoint of whether or not this property is truly surplus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2309)|
| 0:38:36| I think there's a question to be asked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| Surplus property, according to the city code, is property no longer needed or suited for its purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| I assume that to be public purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| And so, historically, what we need to look at is the Harrell Hills area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| And as some of you know, but some of you are too young to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2340)|
| 0:39:08| a couple of council members indicated that they weren't born when this property was purchased by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2348)|
| 0:39:16| That sure made me feel bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| But this property inside the road and the area that has flooded has no way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2360)|
| 0:39:30| the water has no way of getting out other than the sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| And some of the property lies within a basin, which I refer to as that inside of Gaines Road, Claremont Drive, and Cranberry Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2376)|
| 0:39:49| There was property outside the boundary of those three roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| And those properties were purchased in the late 70s to solve a particular problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2395)|
| 0:40:02| The purposes of that were twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| One, to have a collection basin for stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| And secondly, to have that collection basin drain through that sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| So there were two things or three things involved there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| Number one, having a better collection basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| And secondly, to protect the sinkhole so that it would do what it was supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2422)|
| 0:40:30| And in the late 70s, some of you have seen probably some deeds dating from about 77.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2430)|
| 0:40:39| We purchased approximately 21 houses inside those, that boundary that I've described being part of those roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2439)|
| 0:40:49| and some outside, all of which flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| And having done that, we have to be sensitive, I think, to disposing of any of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2455)|
| 0:41:07| Secondly, the city itself has adopted a development land development policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2467)|
| 0:41:18| It has identified this area particularly as a critical sinkhole watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2478)|
| 0:41:27| And among the things that the policy says that you can't tell what a sinkhole is functioning like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2487)|
| 0:41:38| or how it will function by just looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| Secondly, if it's well-drained today, it may clog and not drain tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2503)|
| 0:41:50| Excess silt and sedimentation can choke the mouth of a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2510)|
| 0:41:57| And so I would say that the problem here is the use, number one, whether it is an excess property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2517)|
| 0:42:11| And secondly, if it is excess property, would the siltation and sedimentation that may result from tilled soil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2531)|
| 0:42:23| cause flooding and or choke the sinkhole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2543)|
| 0:42:30| And thirdly, back to the liability issue, I would say simply that for the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2550)|
| 0:42:39| were it to be determined that their land management practices resulted in the sinkhole clogging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2559)|
| 0:42:48| then there could be potential liability for that property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| Ms. Rowe, Jamie Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| I've got a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| Could I kind of come around here and show you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| I'm going to get out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| I'll talk kind of loud and not at the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| This shows the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| It's all flood zone A by feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| As you'll notice, all the area is under me and is part of the flood zone A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2597)|
| 0:43:25| But it's all very scary to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| The city lots are right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| Our property is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| We compiled video from several neighbors of three storm events filmed over a period of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2619)|
| 0:43:47| and feel free to watch this while I talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| It should be on your screens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| Tonight we gave you a letter dated March 15th from Paul Schmierbach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2634)|
| 0:44:01| who is a professional engineer and TDEC water pollution control manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2641)|
| 0:44:07| who retired last November with 43 years as an environmental engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2647)|
| 0:44:14| And I'm just going to read excerpts from his letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| but you all have his resume on the second page and the entire letter there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| Ms. Rowe, you requested I examine Harrell Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| This area is flooded due to sinkholes and lack of drainage for over 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| Dr. Don Overton, assistant professor of UT in a 1973 study, says, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| in Harrell Hills there are 11 active sinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| Houses that were constructed in three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| Flooding occurs when storms produce runoff in excess of the ability of the sink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2684)|
| 0:44:50| an underlying cavern system into which it drains to carry off the flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| There is no surface drainage from this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| Capacity of the underground drainage system is exceeded during periods of heavy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2700)|
| 0:45:06| prolonged rain, and that ends the quote of Dr. Overton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| and the rest of his letter begins here from Mr. Schmierbach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| Flooding from sinkholes is always a concern when contributing drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| includes quantities of sediment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| Sinkholes can easily plug from sediment, trash, or debris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| as noted in the city's stormwater engineering policy 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| Sinkholes may close because of land use changes or for no given reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2730)|
| 0:45:37| and they should be considered very fragile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| Studies should be conducted before land use changes in the drainage area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| in order to evaluate potential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| and ensure the potential for clogging the sinkholes would not exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| or to provide preventative measures in order to mitigate potential impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| Due to the sensitive nature of sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| every effort should be made to minimize changes to the landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| or drainage areas of sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| If this area floods after being kept as a garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| sediment would be expected to travel with drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| and could impact the sinkholes, signed Paul Schmierbach, P.E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2779)|
| 0:46:25| Before we go on, I would like to clarify that I did tell Mr. Dunn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2785)|
| 0:46:29| that we would be happy to allow him to garden several acres, if he wants to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| on property on Audubon that belongs to us that's not in the flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| It's on the map there, and over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| there's probably been three different families that have had gardens there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| for over a collective period of 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| No one's gardening there at the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| Sam Parnell, Director of City Engineering in 1996,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| on the impact of building nine homes on Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| the impact that it would have on the Harrell Hill sinkholes, said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| Homeowners have stated flooding has gotten worse over the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| In addition to the groundwater table being very high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| evidenced by saturation of lawns and flooding of holes in lawns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| some people's homes require boats for access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| because the roadway at Claremont is flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| Ms. Rowe, you have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| Oh, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| Mayor, I would ask that we extend the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| We need to hear all these speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| Director, I'll give you an extra three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| Three minutes and see where she's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| I should be able to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| Homeowners report flooding has already been within inches of heat pumps and foundations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| The city purchased residences with taxpayer money that were already flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| Any increase in structure flooding is unacceptable, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| Due to the potential impact of the sinkhole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| engineering allowed only one home to be built on Tazewell Pike on 3 1⁄2 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| because they were worried about the impact it would have on the sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| In 1977, nine of the 21 homes that were purchased by the city were on Claremont| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2893)|
| 0:48:21| because that's where the elevation is the lowest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| and that's where these lots are, and it floods more often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| City bought the homes, but nothing was done to alleviate the flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2908)|
| 0:48:34| and city engineering even said at the time there was no way to alleviate the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2914)|
| 0:48:41| Since the 1990s, with more homes and condos being built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| we now have a lot of water that flows across our property on Tazewell Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2925)|
| 0:48:53| all the way back to Claremont, and there's a 30-foot elevation drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| from our home all the way back to Claremont,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| and the water flows, if you've noticed on YouTube,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| and I guess my husband couldn't get this to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| but on YouTube it shows that the flooding is really pretty much, even from our side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2948)|
| 0:49:16| much less 60, 50 to 60 percent of the watershed being up above Garden Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2956)|
| 0:49:22| Since the 90s, that's been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| So with storms, we have two or three acres of our field even that's underwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| besides what's over on the sinkhole side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| because that's right there at it, and it drops over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| Regarding the sale of these lots, city engineering has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| as long as it's a limited amount of tilled space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| the risk to the sinkhole's ability to drain is microscopic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| Well, the city has several more lots for sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| and once that first sale takes place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| I don't know how council would be able to deny other citizens purchasing a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| in order to do the same thing to garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| Are you just now going to allow one gardener?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| And where's the tipping point on sediment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| If this sinkhole stops working, there'll be flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| That's a given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| And there's no way of predicting how many homes will be flooded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| or how widespread the flooding will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| Is it worth $10 a year in property taxes to put homes at risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| The city land development manual in 8.8 says, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| Policy 12 contains the locations of notable sinkholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| with documented drainage problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| And as Mr. Roach told you, Policy 12 lists Harold Hills as one of those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| You were all elected to apply judgments as human beings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| in finding solutions to problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| and making decisions for the protection of the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| Please don't sell this property purchased with taxpayer money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| for the purpose of flood control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| Thank you, Ms. Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| Ms. Malone, Carleen Malone, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| Always a pleasure, Mayor Harrow, members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3074)|
| 0:51:23| Carleen Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| Let's talk about what we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| We know that in 1977, 21 homes and 3 additional lots were purchased with taxpayer's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| We know that the sinkhole is the only drainage method for this watershed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| and it's a fairly significant watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| There is no other way to drain this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| And as recently as a few weeks ago, and certainly when I was on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| I asked engineering, is there any other way to drain this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| And the answer has always been no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| The costs are prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| It was looked at in the administration prior to John Roach as law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| It was looked at under Mayor Testiman's administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| Back then, the estimates were $20 million to try to pipe the water to First Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| Well, as you might imagine, the First Creek people weren't too happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| and I'm not, since they were flooding then and they still are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| and I'm not sure a federal law would allow you now to even move water from one watershed to another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| but that's not an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| Whatever goes into Harrell Hills goes down through the sinkhole or it stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| That's the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| We also know that these two lots that are for sale had homes on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3161)|
| 0:52:48| We know that this exact area is conspicuously noted in the city's land use development manual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3168)|
| 0:52:55| policy 12, and is listed as a critical sinkhole watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| There are only a total of seven critical sinkhole watersheds listed in the land development manual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3180)|
| 0:53:07| which I didn't write.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| The engineering department wrote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| Of those seven, two are across the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| One is Timothy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| You're familiar with all of those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| Harrell Hills is another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| You don't want to get familiar with that the same way you're familiar with the other two right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| because I know there are big price tags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| We know that these two lots are in FEMA District A, high-risk flood area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3209)|
| 0:53:36| They are underwater several feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| We know that this area will flood again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| It's not a question of if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| It's a question of when it will flood again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| We know that sinkholes are unpredictable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| They're fragile and that silt and sediment clog them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| and if they get clogged, it reduces the rate of drainage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| or they get stopped up and fail altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| Again, policy 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| We know that existing homes remain today in harm's way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| The floodwater comes very close to their foundations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| Please don't think that just because the city bought a total of 24 lots and 21 homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3248)|
| 0:54:15| that we have all the land we need to never have additional structure flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| That's just not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| There will be more homes and more families flooded out if the sinkhole slows down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| We know that water running over tilled soil or disturbed soil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| will move the soil toward the sinkhole and into the sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| We now know that any additional rate of absorption by tilled soil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| over the rate of absorption by grassed soil is meaningless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3279)|
| 0:54:47| When water is moving over the soil at a rapid rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| and when the soil is saturated or, frankly, as is the case here, when it's underwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| it's like pulling the plug in a bathtub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| We've all had that experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| We know that city engineering says there is indeed a risk posed by the tilled soil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3302)|
| 0:55:08| although in their opinion it's minuscule as long as it is a, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| limited amount of tilled space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| In other words, we know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| The area will flood again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| Drainage is totally dependent on the ability of the sinkhole to take the water in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| Sediment chokes sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| Tilled soil increases the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| Existing homes are still at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| And a lot of taxpayers' money was spent to get to the balance point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| that we now have enjoyed since 1977 with no additional structure flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| although there is yard and street flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| These streets are closed during the storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| Ms. Maloney, you have 30 seconds, unless council gives you more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| Without objection, three more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| In addition to your 24 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| Why make any change that increases the risk of disastrous flooding of homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3359)|
| 0:56:06| As was pointed out, all kinds of things, leaves, twigs, cars, grass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3366)|
| 0:56:13| all of these things pose a risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| There is no question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| But those risks are associated with families living in homes, part of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3377)|
| 0:56:25| There are risks you can't do anything about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| This is a risk, however, the garden risk, the tilled soil risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| is a risk that you can do something about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| There are some who think that government should be run like a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| I think at the very least that business practices ought to be applied to decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3402)|
| 0:56:49| There is no business in the world, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| that would ever increase a flood risk for a one-time payment of $1,500 and $10 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3413)|
| 0:57:04| If you sell these lots, you are selling city flood control assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| while asking the taxpayers to maintain the liability forevermore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| Dealing with the misery of a flooded neighborhood is really something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| It is tragedy, it is misery, and it is millions in taxpayer funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3441)|
| 0:57:28| Do the cost-benefit analysis of this and tell me it's worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| The decision to sell or not to sell is council's decision alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| Please understand, if engineering advised you not to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| I would never, never come before you and ask you to ignore their advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3462)|
| 0:57:49| but that's not the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| Engineering is saying, well, it wasn't our project, we didn't initiate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| and if you kind of sort of be careful, it won't produce too much problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| You can be more conservative and more protective of taxpayer funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| than the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| You can choose to do no harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| And so I ask you, please vote no to the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| Please protect the city's investment from the 70s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| and it wasn't just the purchases in 77.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| There was a lot of money, hundreds of thousands before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| And please protect the investments of the people who own homes there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| and please protect the sinkhole that they all depend on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| Thank you, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| Okay, council discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| You want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| You want to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| Well, when visiting the site, and I guess, Bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| if you want to come back up to the podium, looking around the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| you were open to subject by the stormwater engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| if they have any best management practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| recommendations to make sure soil stays on site, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| I mean, I'd like to hear what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| If they say I need to spend $10,000, obviously I won't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| But, you know, with my degree in agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| I have some ideas of what you are supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| And, obviously, if a year from now if engineering came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| and did a walk around with me and said stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| then I would definitely listen to what they had or just quit tilling the soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| I don't anticipate that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| If I could just point out a couple things, and I think you're aware of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| but there is a drainage easement on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| So the city still, if I understand drainage easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| they still can go on to that property and do things if they want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| dealing with drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| It clearly says that nothing can be built on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| So please don't confuse this with people building houses or driveways or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| Nothing can be built on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| It can be just used for garden purposes, such as a birdhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| I was told that tilled soil actually helps with the water going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3603)|
| 1:00:09| Those of you who have been to some of the workshops understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| I think to make the sinkhole sound like it's a bathtub where you pull a plug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| and the water goes rushing down, I live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| I see the water goes up slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| It goes down slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| And some of the trees that were planted down by the sinkhole and were mulched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3624)|
| 1:00:29| it has flooded during those storms, never made it to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| And the councilmen who were there looked, and the mulch is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| So it's not like this massive wave of soil and mulch will be roaring towards the sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3637)|
| 1:00:43| So I'll stop there, but I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| I think knowing a little bit and having some experience in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| some of these things we've heard, flooding and gardening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| I think some of the if and could is just conjecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| I don't know that these are definite things that are going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| which lends me to not be against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| I would like to put an amendment for it after we hear some other discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| about possibly buffering the ditch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| because the ditch, even though it's 100-and-whatever feet away from the sinkhole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| is going to carry the sediment water to the drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| And so I think, if anything, we need to have at least a 25-foot buffer from the drainage ditch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| which is on the garden side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| So whatever other recommendations, and maybe Jim Hagerman could speak to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| there's got to be some kind of best management practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| that would lend itself to further protecting this drainage area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| And I don't expect you to list those right now, Jim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| but if there's certain things like filtering capacities like straw bales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| or further plantings of vegetation, bioswales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| things like that I think might be appropriate and not necessarily cost-prohibitive, Bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| if you were serious about having this garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| So gardening is not impervious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| I mean, if you were wanting to build a concrete slab, a structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| something that would increase flooding, then I would certainly be against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| But I think there's other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| When you do a 360 in the area and look around, you see erosion in certain yards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| and you see potential pollution impacts other than having a garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| So I'm certainly inclined to support the garden idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| and would like to hear what other councilpersons have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| Councilman Dallavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| You know, I respect all the people that have come here to speak to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| and I respect the intention of Mr. Dunn to want to have a community garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| I keep coming back to, well, before I say that, I guess I should say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| there isn't a motion pending right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| but I keep coming back to the original proposition that Mr. Roach mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| and obviously occurred to a number of us, I guess, as we look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| Why did we buy this land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| It was for flood protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| It was because this basin is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| and if it fills up the sinkhole and the drainage cavity under the soil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| we've got big problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| We'll be digging holes and putting pipes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| and trying to move water somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| It troubles me that for 35 years the only reason we've owned this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| is for flood control protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| I don't know that anything has changed in 2012 or 2013 to take away that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3807)|
| 1:03:35| If the speakers were correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| it sounds like, if anything, we may be increasing water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| as we do more development in the watershed outside this small six or seven acre area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3822)|
| 1:03:49| that is the bottom of the basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| And some of you know that I'm a gardener.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| I've been gardening for 40 years, and I've got soil in my backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| and I grow my tomatoes and everything else in there that I can get to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| But it seems to me that as to the second part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| there's a better place to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| In other words, one, has the property really become surplus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3850)|
| 1:04:15| or is it still needed to protect existing homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| who have at risk flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| and the city has at risk coming up with millions of dollars to fix problems if they occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| And maybe they'll never occur, and maybe Mark's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| Maybe they'll never occur, but are we willing to take that chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| In other words, what are we weighing on this side, the risk that something bad happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| and what's the benefit on this side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| And I'm going to submit to you as to the second aspect, the risk analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| that we ought to find a better piece of land and encourage this activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| Community gardens, personal gardens are great things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| but we don't need to do it in the bottom of the flood basin near the sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3890)|
| 1:04:57| I originally started asking questions somewhat like I think Mark has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| Well, gosh, we should have setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| We should have an area that's in grass so that it can slow down things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| But the reality is if we have four feet of water and it's moving over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| we're going to put some soil in solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| Can the sinkhole take it? Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| Can the sinkhole take it? Maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| And so I ask, why should we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| We should find a better piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| We should encourage this kind of activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| But I don't think we should take the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| I saw us spend, gosh, $5 million just down the road at Edgemont making a basin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3928)|
| 1:05:36| where we could capture flood water that was coming out of Whites Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| and into First Creek, and we tore down the pizza hut and we moved the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| and we made, in essence, a big hole that we could vegetate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| and it would hold some of the water from rushing downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| We're sitting here, and during Mayor Brown's tenure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| we spent, or at least authorized to spend, $500,000 just to study what's happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3957)|
| 1:06:03| at Prosser Road when that sinkhole clogged up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| and that rose underwater weeks and weeks and weeks at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| Maybe it's because there was a landfill there years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| Maybe it's because the interstate expansion we had two years ago kind of did some blasting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| and maybe affected the substrata rock or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| Maybe it's because the neighbor down the block on Rutledge Pike's been filling in the old quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| But things change, and water flow changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| We flooded the heck out of Chilhowee Park this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| We heard the new chairperson speaking about how they were pumping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| and doing lots of things to get water out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| And what we learned from all that, when we pumped at Timothy, when we pumped at the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| when we bought land on Emily because houses were getting underwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| is that when you go in to fix a problem, when a sinkhole fails, it's very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4009)|
| 1:06:55| It's very uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| There are no easy answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| It isn't like we just call Roto-Rooter and clear it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| So as much as I love the idea of a garden and a community garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| as much as I like the fact that Bill Dunn's background is in agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| and he's dying to have a farm, and I gather his family had a farm years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| you know, we're selling this thing in fee, and anybody can buy this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| He can resell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| The only restriction is no structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| If someone less vigilant than him is there, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| We sell it as forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| And so I ask you to stop at the first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| Is it really surplus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4050)|
| 1:07:31| I think the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| But, again, I would ask my city colleagues and the department heads to find a piece of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4053)|
| 1:07:39| in that general area that's more suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| Let's make something happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| That's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| Let's not do it where the risk outweighs the benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| I wanted to ask a question about a little bit about the history of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| When these homes were sold to the city in 77,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| and I guess I'll direct it to engineering or Christy Branson, what has happened since 77?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4079)|
| 1:08:08| When did the property go up for sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| what has happened between those 34 years that says that it's all right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4090)|
| 1:08:18| This is just a question I'm asking for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| I don't think I have the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| Jim Hagerman is probably the best person to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| John Roach may be the best person to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| Wait a second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| Let's have Mr. Hagerman first, and then go ahead, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4112)|
| 1:08:37| Engineering didn't start this process, so I don't know exactly what started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| I think it was representative Dunn's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| The only thing that's changed probably is that nobody's asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| And in our professional judgment, this particular use does not interfere with its use for flood control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4131)|
| 1:09:06| So it could have happened something this benign could have happened consistent with the use for the last 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4146)|
| 1:09:20| Does that answer your question or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| Well, yes and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4162)|
| 1:09:28| I guess maybe there is no answer to my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| Well, I can tell you, if this is part of the question, that my understanding is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| the city's owned this for a long time and there was a request to purchase the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| and when that is done, when the city owns property and there's a request to purchase it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| then it goes through a review and can be listed as surplus, and there's a surplus sale then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4185)|
| 1:09:53| That happens at other times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| And it just happened to be the piece of property that was asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| And so it went through, he placed a bid on it, and now we're working it through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| That's a good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| So do you want to call on Ms. Malone to have a further answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| She would like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| I was just going to say, if the question is what has happened over there for 30-something years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4214)|
| 1:10:20| there has not been additional structure flooding, but these lots have been underwater from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4220)|
| 1:10:29| And part of the video was 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| I have not gotten over there since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| But if the question is what has happened on this land, on the 21, where the 21 houses sat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4235)|
| 1:10:42| where the 24 lots were purchased, it has served as stormwater retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4242)|
| 1:10:50| It has held back the waters and kept it out of the homes that exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| And on this map, there should be an outline showing the size of the drainage basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4254)|
| 1:11:02| It is a significant drainage basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| It's a lot of water that goes down to that hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| Several comments have been made about Prosser Road, and we've dealt with Prosser Road for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| This past Friday, there was a meeting of stakeholders who were concerned about Prosser Road and Jilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4279)|
| 1:11:26| There has been an engineering study from a design group that council authorized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4286)|
| 1:11:32| and there's been a significant amount of new information concerning that flooding on Prosser Road and Jilhowee Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4292)|
| 1:11:40| the sinkholes that are aligned, where the water ultimately goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| And I think that will probably be coming to council in a few months in the form of some suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| and recommendations for how to deal with Prosser Road, Timothy Road, and the Emily sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| So talking about Prosser Road issues is not talking about the latest information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4317)|
| 1:12:06| and the only reason I know that is because I went to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| So we're a little far afield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| I'd like to suggest we remove Prosser Road from the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| First of all, I want to commend you, Bill, for the idea of a community garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| I know when we met out there and looked at the site, I was real interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4343)|
| 1:12:29| Since then, of course, I've found out that the Rose have offered to their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| which adjoins the what's-the-road-there Audubon, and with the possibility of having a community garden there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4354)|
| 1:12:42| But one of the things that I have to agree with Councilman Della Volpe is if we look at the three questions that Mr. Roach asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4362)|
| 1:12:51| is it surplus, is it appropriate, and what's the liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| I know that it seems like there's a lot of ifs in terms of what if and will it do this and will it do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4375)|
| 1:13:02| I think it's our responsibility to look back and realize that those lots were bought for flood control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| they're there for flood control, and I really question in my own mind now whether or not it's really surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| But I think it's really part of the entire parcel of what goes on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4394)|
| 1:13:20| So I think that that's one of the things that all of us should really consider in terms of what was done in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| and why it was done and that the fact that there is property available for a community garden in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4406)|
| 1:13:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| Bill's standing there for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| Mr. Dunn's standing there and I'd like to hear what else he has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| I need to point out, and Ms. Rogers pointed this out, that this wouldn't be the first lot in the area that was sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| I believe Mr. Keebler bought the lot next to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| And I think as it was pointed out, with the permanent drainage easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| the purpose of that lot remains exactly the same as it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| No matter who owns it, it's still a permanent drainage easement on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4442)|
| 1:14:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| It's funny that Mr. Roach came up with those three questions because that's exactly where I landed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| and had asked the mayor sometime back about you can check KGIS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| and the city has about a thousand pieces of property out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| and surely some of them could be sold for better use than where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| So I think it's important to look at those surplus properties and try to move them back into taxpayers' hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| So I'm very supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| I think this, like what's been pointed out, I'm certainly no lawyer and I'm certainly no hydrologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| But I also asked Mr. Swanson earlier today if there was a way that this property could be leased to Mr. Dunn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4487)|
| 1:14:54| for the purpose of using a garden for a dollar a year and some such thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| And he said that we don't do that as a city, that it's better if we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| I guess we look at those situations if they're a non-profit or a 501c3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| but we don't look at it for individual private use because I think that there's a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| I applaud Mr. Dunn's vision for a community garden, but I think also the lawyer part of me is that I'm not a lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4514)|
| 1:15:24| but the part of me that comes out is like he's taking on a lot of responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| You're becoming one, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| I'm becoming one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| I'm not concerned about the liability that he's taking on and the responsibility that he's taking on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| I mean, a sinkhole property is hard to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| They're hard to sell and hard to buy and the liability that comes with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| And I'm not even sure that even I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| I applaud the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| I'm concerned about the liability not only for Mr. Dunn, but for the city of Knoxville in terms of selling that property to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4548)|
| 1:15:54| I applaud the idea, and I think it could probably be done in another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| I mean, it's like a lot of issues I've seen in the last year or so on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| There's good points on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| The safe thing to do, I think, for the city of Knoxville and the history of it is to leave it alone and for its use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4570)|
| 1:16:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| Councilman Campin, did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| Yeah, just another comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| I think, like Councilwoman Palmer, we can't compare these different issues in sinkholes or apples to oranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4585)|
| 1:16:32| There's sinkhole issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| I just personally don't feel that a garden is going to increase flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| Again, if we were building a slab, if we were building impervious surface and caused more runoff, that might be a serious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| And I would have to concur with the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| I respect all the points they make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| I just think that, again, as amended, keep it off the drainage ditch, install some best management practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4611)|
| 1:17:00| It would be okay to grow some vegetables on this piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| It's not going to cause – Councilman Della Volpe, do you have a lot of soil running off of your garden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4623)|
| 1:17:12| Are you on a slope at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| I have it in a flat area, and there's no sinkhole in my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| Well, again –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| Put four feet of water on it, and some of it could go in solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| Well, there is a lot of ifs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| And, again, there is potential, and I think that if managed properly, a garden would not increase flooding in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4645)|
| 1:17:35| There are other areas in this sinkhole, in this neighborhood, that probably pose a greater threat to the sinkhole becoming clogged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4655)|
| 1:17:44| And, again, I respect all the points that the opposition is making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| I just don't feel like a garden is going to endanger the function of the sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4667)|
| 1:17:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| Before I proceed with comment, there hasn't been a motion or a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| and I think that's because a lot of us feel some of the angst that's been expressed by Councilman Della Volpe, Grieve, and Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4682)|
| 1:18:08| So before I make any comment, is anybody going to make a motion and a second to approve this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4688)|
| 1:18:15| I think that's my job, to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| He's a usurper, isn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| Actually, by Council's rules, typically you do have a motion or a second, but often there's people to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4700)|
| 1:18:26| We allow discussion to happen first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| I believe the Council rules do allow for discussion without a motion and a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| but we have had some discussion without a motion and a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4714)|
| 1:18:42| and I guess I would request, Madam Mayor, that before we proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4722)|
| 1:18:48| and with all of our time, that there is a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| Does anybody wish to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4732)|
| 1:18:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| I'll second with an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| We'll come back to that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| Well, I guess that didn't end it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4742)|
| 1:19:10| I guess the first question I had is for the Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| Is there anything in the documents that require it to be a community garden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| It's not required to be a community garden, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| So if Mr. Dunn buys it today or through this process and he sells it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4760)|
| 1:19:27| if the next person doesn't like the community as much, then it won't be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| What's going to run with the land is a declaration of permanent drainage easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4770)|
| 1:19:34| And that declaration of permanent drainage easement does, it runs with the land, and it does at least three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4774)|
| 1:19:41| Number one, it says that no structure or other building can be erected on any part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| no use will be made which will interfere with the drainage area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| no material change will be made in the ground level or topography of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| It also gives the city of Knoxville the right to enter the drainage easement at any time to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4795)|
| 1:20:01| or improve the function of the drainage easement or to place, construct, repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| or maintain pipelines or drainage facilities on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| and to keep the easement free and clear of anything which interferes with the function of the drainage area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4809)|
| 1:20:15| That is a document that will be incorporated within the deed and run with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4815)|
| 1:20:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| And my question was about the community garden aspect, that that is not part of, that does not run with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4822)|
| 1:20:29| It could purchase it and do nothing with it, just like it's been doing for the last 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| Okay, because we've been talking about a community garden, and that's not in the documents in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4833)|
| 1:20:40| So it's basically at the will of the owner whether they allow the community to farm there or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4840)|
| 1:20:46| I just thought that would be important to get that straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| Again, you know, I sort of see both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| I was really in the middle on this issue and can sympathize with both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4852)|
| 1:20:59| You know, when I went out to the property this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| it doesn't look like there's dirt that's going to just fly into the sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| But I go back to what Mr. Wall said, and, you know, in terms of the people before us spent a lot of money to buy that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4866)|
| 1:21:16| and to protect that and deal with that terrible problem of flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| And it just doesn't seem like the right thing to do to put that at risk by just selling one of these parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4880)|
| 1:21:30| Even though the risk is small, it still doesn't seem worth it to me to go forward with the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4890)|
| 1:21:40| So, you know, I'm not going to be supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| I just had another question to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| Does he have the right to sell the property once he buys it, or is it reverted back to the city, or is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| No, he would have the right to sell it, but he'd have to sell it subject to all restrictions that are on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4912)|
| 1:21:58| including this entire declaration of permanent drainage easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| Okay. Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| We talked about risk on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| We've had a great deal of information from everybody who has an interest in the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4929)|
| 1:22:15| It reminds me of a comment Harry Truman made about economists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| If you line them up end-to-end, they all point in different directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| And that's pretty much where we are on this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| There's clearly some risk involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| There's risk involved if we do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| I'm in favor of turning this into a productive use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| Obviously, Mr. Dunn faces a risk of getting his crops in the ground and then having them wash away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4956)|
| 1:22:44| or just flood and drown, not necessarily wash away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| So, you know, that's a risk he takes, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| We also have had an initiative in this city of gardens and feeding and a food supply thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4971)|
| 1:23:01| And I see where this fits into that, even though we did not receive that grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| This fits into that concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| If Mr. Dunn did not have a degree in agriculture and really didn't seem to have some knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4989)|
| 1:23:15| I'd be a little bit more concerned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| We could add another constraint about the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| We could make reference, amend it to require that it be used as a community garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5002)|
| 1:23:27| so that if he did sell it, if he deeded it to one of his children, that could be a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| But maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| I'm not sure we can require him to put a garden in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| That might have something to do with involuntary servitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| We don't want to go there, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| But I've had mixed feelings about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| And, as I said, a lot of information on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| I have to have confidence that engineering is not going to sell us down the drain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| literally, because they're going to be coming back for money for engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| So, you know, if they give us bad advice, we would not be real happy with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| So I am going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| Obviously, I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| I may be in the vast minority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| But I do think that it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| Every idea, everything we vote on has a risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| And I don't see that this is a lot of difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| Harry Truman also said he'd like to see a one-handed economist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| because they were always saying on one hand this and on the other hand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5065)|
| 1:24:26| I just wanted to say I wanted to address again the fact that I strongly support community gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| And I think that whole idea is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| And I think that with the Rose offering their property just up the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| that that community will be able to have a garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| And what concerns me is, again, it goes back to, is this property really surplus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| And what kind of risk are we really taking when we don't really need to take a risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| And I, too, was pretty much in the middle, back and forth on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| But I do think that sometimes we do have to go back and think about the history and why things were done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| And I think that because we can still have a community garden in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| I think that both sides are going to come out with a win-win situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| If they want to have a community garden in the Rose property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5107)|
| 1:25:14| Mr. Dunn would like to make other comments, but according to our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| I'll be happy to allow him to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| Go right ahead, Mr. Dunn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| No, and I appreciate the offer of using someone else's land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5120)|
| 1:25:27| I'm a little hesitant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| You know, when you're an elected official, you don't want to be beholden to individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| I was, you know, the whole reason this idea came about was I was really approaching the city to see if it was a community garden on public property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5132)|
| 1:25:40| And since you all don't really have ways to do that officially, I was willing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5145)|
| 1:25:46| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5146)|
| 1:25:47| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5147)|
| 1:25:48| I was willing to take this on for myself and to do the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| And I would feel very comfortable if I asked neighbors to come on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5153)|
| 1:25:57| And that way if somebody misbehaved or didn't take care of their garden, I could say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| I wouldn't feel as comfortable inviting neighbors on to someone else's piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5161)|
| 1:26:07| and feeling responsible for the actions that they may take there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| So I appreciate the offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| You know, while you all were talking, I said to Ms. Roe, well, maybe if I get this property, then I'll swap it with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| You can give me the part where you want me to garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| and you can have this part and keep it in grass for the rest of your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| So I don't know if that's a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| And I don't know if today would be a good time to make a rash decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| But we do try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| A motion to swap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| Well, that would not be your all's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5197)|
| 1:26:38| But it would be a possibility, you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5198)|
| 1:26:39| But I do feel, from a policy standpoint, we need to do something where we become more self-sufficient, self-sustaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5199)|
| 1:26:46| And that's one reason that drives me, because it's getting to be too expensive to ship food in from California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5206)|
| 1:26:52| And I thought this was a wonderful opportunity for someone to step up and use his own resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| and pay for the --put his money where his mouth is and grow food locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| But I understand you all have hard decisions to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| and there will be no ill will towards the people who spoke against this or the people on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| Thank you, Mr. Dunn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| Councilman DelVolpe, I'm assuming you're going to call on Ms. Roe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| No, I was going to ask Mr. Dunn first if he would be willing to consider another parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5235)|
| 1:27:21| where we can look at the inventory of land in that general area and make something available for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5241)|
| 1:27:28| In other words, I think if you went around the room, everyone here says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| wow, that's a neat idea, it would be nice to have a community garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| and we're all struggling with are we putting the neighbors at risk for future flooding or whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5255)|
| 1:27:42| I mean, who knows what happens five years from now, ten years from now, in terms of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| So I guess I'm asking you, are you flexible enough if we could find property that would be suitable for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5267)|
| 1:27:53| that you could take that on and whatever help or encouragement we could give you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| Well, I mean, you know, for the past several months, my vision has kind of been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| I've plotted things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| I've seen myself walking down the street with my push mower to mow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5285)|
| 1:28:10| You can do my yard if you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| As I drive around the city, I actually see places that say, boy, that would be a great place for a garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5293)|
| 1:28:17| But most of them you would have to drive to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| It wouldn't be easy to watch over to see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the city gets a watchdog out of this, someone who will go down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5303)|
| 1:28:30| who when the leaves fall, instead of them going in the sinkhole, they're gathered and used as mulch on a garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| And I think that's kind of part of the sustainable community, instead of having the city watch off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| And I just need to stress again, the neighbor who lives right there has said in her 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| she has not seen that property flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| And I think even if you look at the engineer's document at the highest level ever, it's not four feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5329)|
| 1:28:55| And if you look at the flood map and you see where it stretches to, in order to go to the farthest boundaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5335)|
| 1:29:01| so it gets up on this lot, it's already in people's houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| So the first time it goes to the boundaries, it's already in somebody's houses before a grain of soil even moves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5345)|
| 1:29:13| So, you know, maybe I should have been a little bit more over the top in presenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5353)|
| 1:29:20| You did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5360)|
| 1:29:21| I like people to do facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| And maybe I should say, if children don't have these vitamins, they'll die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| But I'm not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| I'm just going to be straight up with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| Having a garden there is not going to affect that sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5374)|
| 1:29:35| I would not do that to Ms. Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| Mr. Law Director, do we have a provision in there that would say that the city can buy the property back for the price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5379)|
| 1:29:45| that is paid plus interest or something if we're unhappy with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| I mean, in other words, once the horse is out of the barn, is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| It's over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5393)|
| 1:29:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5394)|
| 1:29:55| I don't have any clawback or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| You do have the clause that says if we're unhappy with it and something's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| You can put your own pipes on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| Right, at our expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| But we don't have like a buyback clause?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| Not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| I'd like to call on Ms. Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| Ms. Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| I just wanted to make one point about the history of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| Mr. Dunn referred to a neighbor that had bought a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| That lot was sold many, many years ago when they first bought the houses, not too long after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5426)|
| 1:30:33| And that was owned by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| The city did not sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| And then several years ago the county decided that they would sell their extra lots over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5437)|
| 1:30:43| And they put signs up all over the place over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| And several of us went to the city and we were told and we were really concerned that they were going to sell these lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5446)|
| 1:30:52| these surplus lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| And the signs were taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| They didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| And the next thing we knew, the city owned those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| So now the city owns all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| And they must have bought it for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5465)|
| 1:31:06| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5466)|
| 1:31:07| I would like to hear from the lady, Ms. Rogers, if she's willing, who's the neighbor that Representative Dunn has referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5467)|
| 1:31:18| I'd like to get her comments and her thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| If you would like to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| I don't want to force you down if you don't want to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| Bell of Caesar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| I really would like to hear from her since she lives next door and get her thoughts on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5488)|
| 1:31:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5495)|
| 1:31:36| Ms. Rogers, if you'd please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| And thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5499)|
| 1:31:40| I'm Ruth Ann Rogers, and I live at 4220 Claremont Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| And I have no problem at all with Mr. Dunn buying this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5504)|
| 1:31:50| I was looking forward to, in fact, seeing the garden grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| So I know I don't have any problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| And it hasn't flooded in a long time, very recently anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5517)|
| 1:32:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| I'd like to remind Council that several of the people in the area have submitted a petition in support of Mr. Dunn purchasing this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5530)|
| 1:32:18| And I'd like to remind Council that most often when people submit petitions for or against something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5538)|
| 1:32:25| that we do give those very serious consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5545)|
| 1:32:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| Councilman Campin, were you going to suggest an amendment or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5558)|
| 1:32:39| Yes, I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| I also would like to point out, I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| this property and this idea of growing a garden is still subject to all stormwater violations, correct, Director Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5562)|
| 1:32:49| I mean, you know, any problems that would be perceived or otherwise that would happen from growing this garden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5569)|
| 1:32:55| is still subject to a possible notice of violation or anything like that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| Actually, I'm not entirely sure about gardens in general, but this flowage easement kind of seals that up very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5579)|
| 1:33:08| I don't think we have a whole lot of authority on what's going on in this area because of the flowage easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5593)|
| 1:33:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| Yeah, my amendment is, again, just there has to be a minimum of 25-foot buffer off of the drainage ditch, which is right next to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5595)|
| 1:33:24| So that, you know, suffices for regulations at a state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5604)|
| 1:33:32| I mean, I would like to say 25 feet off the ditch because that drainage ditch, as I read it, goes right down into the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5612)|
| 1:33:40| which feeds the sinkhole, so he still has ample room for growing a garden above that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5620)|
| 1:33:46| If I'm looking at the map correctly and off my thumbnail reading of the scale, it's approximately 200 feet long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5626)|
| 1:33:53| So, you know, 25 feet is not too much to ask for a buffer along there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5633)|
| 1:34:02| The problem is I'm not sure exactly how you're going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| I mean, the motion that's on the floor is to sell the property consistent with the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5645)|
| 1:34:14| And so it's subject to these various documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5654)|
| 1:34:19| It's up or down, you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5659)|
| 1:34:20| But can we not somehow legally make sure that he stays 25 feet off the ditch with, you know, no tillage within that 25 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5660)|
| 1:34:31| We can sufficiently describe that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| And if Mr. Dunn is willing to accept that as a condition on the sale of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5676)|
| 1:34:43| We didn't advertise it in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| When we put it out for bid, we didn't put it out for bid in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| Well, I can ask Bill if he's willing to accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| Well, first of all, I think the measurement should be from the road because the ditch kind of waves and people could measure from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5693)|
| 1:34:59| Well, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5699)|
| 1:35:00| The ditch is only two and a half feet wide, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| So if you want to say from the pavement edge, then I would be okay with that if you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5703)|
| 1:35:09| I mean, I'd like to pace it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5709)|
| 1:35:10| Let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| You can take that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| And if I go out there and pace it off and say, I mean, remember, I'm taking a risk here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| I could plow up the ground and find out that thing doesn't grow anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5722)|
| 1:35:23| Then it's mine to mow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5723)|
| 1:35:24| I'm putting a whole lot of skin out there to promote gardens in my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5724)|
| 1:35:30| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| I don't know if 20 feet, I could say, yes, sir, from the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| Twenty-five, I'm not quite sure that's starting to get whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| Twenty from the road gets you at least 10 to 15 feet from the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5741)|
| 1:35:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| Well, I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| I'm not going to let five feet change my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| I think, again, the fact that we're talking about a garden here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5757)|
| 1:36:03| So, okay, I'm okay with that subject, 20 feet off the pavement edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5763)|
| 1:36:10| I'll give you my assurance that I will not till a garden there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| Probably won't even get within 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| Is there a second to that proposed amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| I mean, we're here micromanaging two lots in North Knoxville or anywhere in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5786)|
| 1:36:34| And we're not going to go out there and measure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| I mean, you're subjecting engineering and oversight into the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| whether it's being done right or it's wrong or it's this or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| I mean, that's just not a good use of our resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| I mean, just think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| I mean, I just applaud Mr. Dunn's efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| I'm not sure that I believe the whole –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| I'm not all that overly concerned about the drainage and the sinkhole being stopped up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| as much as that we're just giving a ton of oversight to something that is so minor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5819)|
| 1:37:05| in comparison to what we need to be using our resources on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| Well, I agree with Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| But also I have a question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| If we start putting amendments on these two lots that were for sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| then don't in essence we have to go back and resell them under the new conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| because you're changing the conditions for which they were sold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| Well, you're making the conditions more onerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| And so if you were making the conditions more favorable to the purchaser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| then I think you'd have to clearly go back and re-bid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| But in this situation, you're making the conditions more onerous to the purchaser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5858)|
| 1:37:43| and so I don't perceive that as a problem with regard to having to go back and bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5863)|
| 1:37:49| But as I understand what's being proposed in the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5869)|
| 1:37:54| what we would do is go back and amend this Declaration of Permanent Drainage Easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5874)|
| 1:38:00| to include your stipulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| Does everybody understand that's how that would be accomplished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| It would be included in the Declaration of Permanent Drainage Easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| Because I don't know how else you're going to accomplish what you want to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5891)|
| 1:38:16| I think that sounds fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| Again, a great idea, the wrong place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5901)|
| 1:38:25| And it just strikes me that if we're going to start negotiating the contract here at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5905)|
| 1:38:31| then maybe we should have him plant it in ryegrass in the winter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5911)|
| 1:38:36| you know, so that if the flood comes in the wintertime, it won't wash the dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| I mean, where are we going to stop that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| Why don't we have a right to repurchase it for the purchase price if we're unhappy with the result?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5921)|
| 1:38:47| And I think George Wallace said it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| Why are we going to micromanage two lots when we have issues that we can't even afford to spend tax dollars on to solve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5930)|
| 1:38:57| I mean, Councilman Palmer mentioned Prosser Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| They're not identical, but it reflects the cost and the gyrations we go through when one of these things goes bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5940)|
| 1:39:08| And I'm just saying we shouldn't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| Let's find a piece of land that's suitable and urge that it be used, make it available to be used, lease it for a dollar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5951)|
| 1:39:17| sell it for $2, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| Let's not take on a burden to the people that live there, as well as our taxpayers, when we don't have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5959)|
| 1:39:27| This is not the last piece of land on a tropic island that is going to feed the Indians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5967)|
| 1:39:31| I mean, this is one piece of land in hundreds of thousands of acres in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5971)|
| 1:39:37| We can find a suitable track, is my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5977)|
| 1:39:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5981)|
| 1:39:42| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| Well, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| Again, I'm not trying to --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| We have a whole department of codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| We're overworked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5989)|
| 1:39:50| Well, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| I'll personally go out and monitor the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| I mean, it's a garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| It's high profile when it floods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| Believe me, my mother-in-law lives right down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| I'm happy to drive by there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| This is about the zucchini you're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| I just think, again, I'm happy to keep an eye on it, just like the city will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6006)|
| 1:40:11| It's a major flood event, and there's no soil running off this man's garden into the sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6011)|
| 1:40:17| And, you know, it will present itself if it's a major problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6017)|
| 1:40:22| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| I just want to say again that I agree with Councilman Wallace and Dellavopia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| and I'd like to call the question on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| I see no other lights on, so we will just go ahead and proceed to that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6030)|
| 1:40:35| We have a motion and a second on the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| which is to include a minimum 20-foot buffer from the pavement edge to the garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6038)|
| 1:40:44| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6044)|
| 1:40:45| Okay, so all in favor of that amendment say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| Seven to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| Two opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| We're now to the original motion, which is to approve the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6058)|
| 1:41:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| Is that three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| So were there two or three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6075)|
| 1:41:16| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| I said aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| So three, four, six against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| So the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| Thank you, Mr. Dunn, Ms. Malone, Ms. Rowe, and Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=6089)|

| 2:01:28| Councilman Dallavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7288)|
| 2:01:29| Yeah, is Mark Donaldson still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7289)|
| 2:01:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7290)|
| 2:01:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7291)|
| 2:01:32| Hey Mark, what was the reason for going from R1 low density to R1A low density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7292)|
| 2:01:37| What does that do or change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7297)|
| 2:01:38| Or R1A, I'm sorry, is low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7298)|
| 2:01:42| Mark Donaldson with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| It mimics the zoning that's on the property adjacent to this request, which has R1A and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7306)|
| 2:01:54| has a couple of duplexes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| The duplex yard or area requirements are somewhat smaller in the R1A and make it possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7318)|
| 2:02:06| But it's compatible with what's next door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7326)|
| 2:02:08| Yeah, it's got R1A on the west side and R2, which is our apartment zoning on the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7328)|
| 2:02:14| side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7334)|
| 2:02:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7335)|
| 2:02:16| So it fits in with the neighborhood, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7336)|
| 2:02:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7338)|

| 2:02:25| So we are now at a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| We have two people that have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7347)|
| 2:02:29| The first is Ms. Ruby Wright, and the second is Jim Ulrich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7349)|
| 2:02:35| Ms. Wright, if you'd like to come down and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7355)|
| 2:02:39| According to council rules, you have up to five minutes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7362)|
| 2:02:55| My name is Ruby C. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| I reside at 4320 Skyline Drive, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7378)|
| 2:03:09| Mrs. Wilson said that she would give you a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7389)|
| 2:03:15| We'll make a copy and make available for you all tomorrow the things that I have been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7395)|
| 2:03:22| with regard to the complaint that I filed concerning my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7402)|
| 2:03:36| The primary problem with it is that the way that my property was handled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7416)|
| 2:03:42| it did, in fact, violate my First and Fourth Amendment rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7422)|
| 2:03:47| But I would just ask you to wait until I finish before you say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7427)|
| 2:03:56| What you will have before you are documents that were sent to Ms. Branson, the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7436)|
| 2:04:02| and the Attorney General and the State's Attorney General, the U.S. Attorney General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7442)|
| 2:04:07| Anyone wishing for a copy of the emails in the interest of transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7447)|
| 2:04:12| I have no problems with sending you it through email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7452)|
| 2:04:16| The gist of what the documents contain, given to the city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7456)|
| 2:04:20| is documentation of fraud and theft perpetrated by the Codes and Enforcement Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7460)|
| 2:04:25| directed by David Brace and managed by Robert Moyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7465)|
| 2:04:29| as the city relies on the people to be ignorant on the risk to break people's First| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7469)|
| 2:04:35| and Fourth Amendment rights into bullying and carrying out acts of fraud and theft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7475)|
| 2:04:41| Car maintenance and use of roads is the jurisdiction of the county and not the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7481)|
| 2:04:47| and the city may not enact laws that go contrary to the direction of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7487)|
| 2:04:52| The person needs to make an affidavit of non-use of a vehicle that the car was not in use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7492)|
| 2:05:01| and resume paying for the current year of said resumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7501)|
| 2:05:05| The city requires that the car be covered on three sides or stored in a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7505)|
| 2:05:11| My son's car was housed by a retaining wall on one side, fence on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7511)|
| 2:05:18| and the wall of the house on the other side, as well as being covered on the top, the sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7518)|
| 2:05:26| the front, the back, by a car cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| The Codes Enforcement Department, headed up by David Brace and managed by Robert Moyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7531)|
| 2:05:36| perpetrated fraud by falsifying documents to perpetrate theft on my son's 57 Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7536)|
| 2:05:44| The process began in 2011 to set the theft of the theft when John Ford, 2011, boarded up my secure dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7544)|
| 2:06:04| It was not open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7564)|
| 2:06:08| He could not produce pictures of the inside of the house because the house was, in fact, secure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7568)|
| 2:06:15| and entry was not possible without using a master key or busting down the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7575)|
| 2:06:21| So he falsified documents that was turned in to the board that held his name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7581)|
| 2:06:27| his address, his address, and his address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7587)|
| 2:06:32| So he falsified documents that was turned in to the board that held hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7592)|
| 2:06:37| and while I did have a representative there and the facts did not support Ford's report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7597)|
| 2:06:43| the board ruled the Codes Enforcement's favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7603)|
| 2:06:47| The Codes Enforcement Department also did not, on the supposed inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7607)|
| 2:06:54| report that the grass had been cut, or he did not go back out and check after the 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7614)|
| 2:07:02| He ordered me to move my son's car to somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7622)|
| 2:07:07| and the car was moved to comply over and above the three sides rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7627)|
| 2:07:12| Ma'am, you have 45 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7632)|
| 2:07:14| In 2012, Brenda Lloyd was living in that dwelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7634)|
| 2:07:19| and she left because she could not pay the rent, much less cut the grass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| and stayed basically rent-free to August 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7643)|
