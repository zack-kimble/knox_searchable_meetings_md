| 2:58:51| Do you feel like if, so this policy, all it does is give a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10731)|
| 2:58:54| clarity about how it's implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10734)|
| 2:58:56| If this sunsets on August 1st, have you and your team talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10736)|
| 2:59:01| does that create now all of a sudden a lot of unclarity about how it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10741)|
| 2:59:05| to be implemented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10745)|
| 2:59:07| I guess the reason I'm asking that is I'm fine for it to sunset, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10747)|
| 2:59:10| don't want in it sunsetting causing a lot of confusion, which is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10750)|
| 2:59:14| intent of the policy in the first place was to bring clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10754)|
| 2:59:20| Thank you, Mr. Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10760)|
| 2:59:21| With what the board approved in terms of the recommendation this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10761)|
| 2:59:25| evening, to me it's clear in terms of the face masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10765)|
| 2:59:29| So this sunsets, you know, I don't think that has any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10769)|
| 2:59:33| So let me say I'm hoping all this changes by the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10773)|
| 2:59:37| I am not a fan of face masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10777)|
| 2:59:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10779)|
| 2:59:40| So I'm not trying to impose any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10780)|
| 2:59:41| I'm just trying to make sure that we keep everybody as safe as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10781)|
| 2:59:44| We can, you know, and following the science of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10784)|
| 2:59:47| So let me just say that because I'm not trying to penalize anybody by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10787)|
| 2:59:51| wearing a face mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10791)|
| 2:59:52| I hate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10792)|
| 2:59:53| I think I said one night I'd like to join you whenever we burn these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10793)|
| 2:59:56| things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10796)|
| 2:59:57| So that's where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10797)|
| 2:59:58| But in the meantime, you know, we're close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10798)|
| 3:00:01| We're getting close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10801)|
| 3:00:02| And I'm optimistic that we're going to, you know, look, it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10802)|
| 3:00:06| look a whole lot different next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10806)|
| 3:00:07| So I'm okay if you sunset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10807)|
| 3:00:09| I'd say August one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10809)|
| 3:00:10| I mean, that's what we talked about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10810)|
| 3:00:12| But obviously the board wants to move before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10812)|
| 3:00:15| And they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10815)|
| 3:00:16| But I think it I think you're I appreciate what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10816)|
| 3:00:19| I think it is clear that we just approved that we'll have masks as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10819)|
| 3:00:22| long as the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10822)|
| 3:00:23| What I'm asking is a little bit different of a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10823)|
| 3:00:26| And that is, do you feel like there's enough clarity about how it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10826)|
| 3:00:30| will be implemented in your guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10830)|
| 3:00:33| Or does the policy still need to remain intact for clarity about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10833)|
| 3:00:36| it's implemented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10836)|
| 3:00:38| I feel like with what what you approved, we've got the direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10838)|
| 3:00:42| that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10842)|
| 3:00:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10843)|
| 3:00:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10846)|
| 3:00:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10848)|
| 3:00:49| Let's just go to Miss Christie and then miss bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10849)|
| 3:00:53| Then miss bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10853)|
| 3:00:54| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10854)|
| 3:00:55| I support the original motion, not the substitute or the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10855)|
| 3:01:02| And the reason being is, well, you know, I said I would support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10862)|
| 3:01:07| sunsetting in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10867)|
| 3:01:09| But also I think, you know, even if we I know this is probably going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10869)|
| 3:01:14| make some people mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10874)|
| 3:01:15| But let's just theoretically speaking, you know, we've all said, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10875)|
| 3:01:19| the vaccine should be the end game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10879)|
| 3:01:21| You know, Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10881)|
| 3:01:22| Child said the vaccines are the way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10882)|
| 3:01:25| Well, we still have a large percentage of people that haven't gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10885)|
| 3:01:32| the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10892)|
| 3:01:33| You know, we're talking about parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10893)|
| 3:01:35| It just now opened up for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10895)|
| 3:01:39| So you still have parents waiting on first doses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10899)|
| 3:01:41| We still have teachers waiting on second doses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10901)|
| 3:01:44| I mean, I feel like, you know, August gives them a lot, those that want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10904)|
| 3:01:49| the vaccines, a lot more time to get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10909)|
| 3:01:51| And I do worry that we'll lose students and maybe even teachers in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10911)|
| 3:01:55| summer school if we change this policy now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10915)|
| 3:02:00| But I do support the original date on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10920)|
| 3:02:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10924)|
| 3:02:05| Ms. Bowne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10925)|
| 3:02:06| Yeah, I guess I'm the same way with supporting the original date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10926)|
| 3:02:10| I just haven't thought about summer school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10930)|
| 3:02:11| I mean, originally when Ms. Bowne said the end of May, I wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10931)|
| 3:02:14| considering summer school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10934)|
| 3:02:15| So with summer school in mind, I do think I would support the August 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10935)|
| 3:02:20| I just do want clarity on people that because we are sunsetting this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10940)|
| 3:02:24| it does not mean that there might not be face masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10944)|
| 3:02:27| Once again, I hope we don't have face masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10947)|
| 3:02:29| But the recommendation is what we're going to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10949)|
| 3:02:31| And I think if come August, we think there needs to be more clarity, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10951)|
| 3:02:35| even July, we always can come up with another policy that fits the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10955)|
| 3:02:40| recommendation better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10960)|
| 3:02:41| I think the policy we passed last year fit this year's recommendation well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10961)|
| 3:02:46| but doesn't necessarily go with the recommendation for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10966)|
| 3:02:49| And I could see possibly us needing to revisit a policy that more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10969)|
| 3:02:52| directly, but hopefully in July even, that's two, three months out, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10972)|
| 3:02:56| have a little bit more clarity on our direction and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10976)|
| 3:03:00| So I can support the original motion, but not the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10980)|
| 3:03:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10985)|
| 3:03:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10986)|
| 3:03:07| Ms. Bowne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10987)|
| 3:03:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10988)|
| 3:03:09| So I'm going to withdraw my friendly substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10989)|
| 3:03:14| I may lose one vote, but we will gain five to sunset this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10994)|
| 3:03:21| However, I would like to say that in summer school, depending on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11001)|
| 3:03:26| number of students and based on what we just passed, when physical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11006)|
| 3:03:30| distancing is feasible inside KCS facilities, masks will not be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11010)|
| 3:03:36| for students and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11016)|
| 3:03:38| So if we can separate all these kids six feet apart this summer and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11018)|
| 3:03:43| have five in a classroom or however many, then they wouldn't have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11023)|
| 3:03:47| wear a mask anyway, according to this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11027)|
| 3:03:50| So I will withdraw my motion if you will agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11030)|
| 3:03:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11033)|
| 3:03:54| If I can, since Ms. Henderson made the motion, we will need a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11034)|
| 3:04:01| substitute motion if you agree with what Ms. Bowne just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11041)|
| 3:04:05| We will need you to, you would go back to your original motion, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11045)|
| 3:04:10| Do I need to read the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11050)|
| 3:04:12| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11052)|
| 3:04:13| To wait for reading, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11053)|
| 3:04:14| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11054)|
| 3:04:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11055)|
| 3:04:16| So this is a new substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11056)|
| 3:04:17| That way we do not have to talk about masks anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11057)|
| 3:04:20| I make a motion to suspend board policy B200, policy development and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11060)|
| 3:04:25| adoption in the requirement for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11065)|
| 3:04:27| Can I interrupt just one second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11067)|
| 3:04:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11069)|
| 3:04:30| Because Ms. Owen already made a comment that she would like for us not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11070)|
| 3:04:35| to consider the waiving in the same policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11075)|
| 3:04:38| Can we just separate those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11078)|
| 3:04:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11081)|
| 3:04:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11082)|
| 3:04:43| What does that, hold on, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11083)|
| 3:04:44| I'm getting confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11084)|
| 3:04:47| It would, we just make the motion to suspend the policy, yes or no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11087)|
| 3:04:53| and then do the face mask vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11093)|
| 3:04:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11096)|
| 3:04:58| So it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11098)|
| 3:04:59| It's your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11099)|
| 3:05:01| That was her request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11101)|
| 3:05:03| To suspend the policy, to suspend the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11103)|
| 3:05:09| First reading policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11109)|
| 3:05:14| Just to separate them is what they're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11114)|
| 3:05:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11116)|
| 3:05:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11117)|
| 3:05:18| So can you just make that motion for that first, the first and second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11118)|
| 3:05:23| reading portion of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11123)|

| 3:06:11| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11171)|

| 3:06:25| first reading on policy C240.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11185)|

| 3:07:00| So I read this whole thing again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11220)|
| 3:07:02| Only the portion regarding C240.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11222)|
| 3:07:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11225)|
| 3:07:06| And the requirement for two readings on this policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11226)|
| 3:07:10| Oh, my gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11230)|

| 3:07:23| first reading has been suspended for this particular motion, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11243)|

| 3:07:50| On the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11270)|
| 3:07:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11271)|

| 3:08:03| Now, we have simply 240, C240 on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11283)|
| 3:08:09| We have two lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11289)|

| 3:08:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11295)|

| 3:08:20| everybody's had the vaccine, but I don't think we've yet mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11300)|
| 3:08:23| it in the context of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11303)|

| 3:08:30| And I think it's important for us just to acknowledge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11310)|
| 3:08:33| Not that we make decisions based on a handful of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11313)|
| 3:08:35| That's not the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11315)|
| 3:08:36| And I don't think those folks want that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11316)|
| 3:08:38| But I do think it's important to acknowledge that it's not a matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11318)|
| 3:08:41| of, do they want to be vaccinated or not be vaccinated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11321)|

| 3:10:57| I hear you over and over, and I heard you say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11457)|
| 3:11:00| we have to have a conclusion to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11460)|
| 3:11:03| We have to figure out a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11463)|
| 3:11:05| And you can't figure out the way, and you're lost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11465)|
| 3:11:07| because you don't have the keys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11467)|
| 3:11:10| Because the people who have the keys don't like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11470)|
| 3:11:13| They don't trust you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11473)|
| 3:11:15| You don't have a relationship with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11475)|
| 3:11:17| And we've done this to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11477)|
| 3:11:19| We've done it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11479)|
| 3:11:20| You've done it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11480)|
| 3:11:21| We don't trust you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11481)|
| 3:11:22| You don't trust us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11482)|
| 3:11:23| It just is a cycle that we have done over and over and over and over for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11483)|
| 3:11:26| years and years, and it's really horrible here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11486)|
| 3:11:31| We have our own little mini civil war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11491)|
| 3:11:33| So what I'm saying to you today is that I have held myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11493)|
| 3:11:36| and my own house accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11496)|
| 3:11:39| I am the mother who has turned a blind eye also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11499)|
| 3:11:43| I have a 19-year-old son who almost died last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11503)|
| 3:11:47| in the shooting on Atlantis Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11507)|
| 3:11:49| I am her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11509)|
| 3:11:51| So I'm holding myself accountable, and my household,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11511)|
| 3:11:53| and my children, and my family, and I'm going to take my home back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11513)|
| 3:11:56| And I'm going to hold my friends, and I'm going to hold my classmates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11516)|
| 3:11:58| and I'm going to hold them accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11518)|
| 3:12:00| And I'm going to hold my church accountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11520)|
| 3:12:01| and I'm going to ask them to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11521)|
| 3:12:03| And I'm going to ask you today to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11523)|
| 3:12:05| I'm going to ask you to go to those parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11525)|
| 3:12:07| and go and to let them know that we dropped the ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11527)|
| 3:12:10| Just admit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11530)|
| 3:12:12| We dropped the ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11532)|
| 3:12:13| And any time our children go to school or go to church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11533)|
| 3:12:15| or in our community, and we can't knock on the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11535)|
| 3:12:17| or go to somewhere or go to an adult for safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11537)|
| 3:12:21| for the peers to say, I'm not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11541)|
| 3:12:26| They didn't feel that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11546)|
| 3:12:28| They didn't have anyone that they felt like they could go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11548)|
| 3:12:30| And when they went to other adults,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11550)|
| 3:12:32| we didn't know how to handle the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11552)|
| 3:12:34| the way that we've dealt with it, the way that we've always dealt with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11554)|
| 3:12:39| For us as a community, it goes back to the way that we breed our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11559)|
| 3:12:43| It goes back to what we have to do as what we've always done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11563)|
| 3:12:48| We've gotten away from a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11568)|
| 3:12:49| We haven't raised this generation of babies that are causing this chaos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11569)|
| 3:12:52| We didn't raise them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11572)|
| 3:12:54| YouTube, social media, World Star, Snapchat, they've raised them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11574)|
| 3:13:00| And we've dropped the ball on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11580)|
| 3:13:02| And I'm guilty for it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11582)|
| 3:13:04| So before I say that you're wrong, I'm calling myself on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11584)|
| 3:13:08| Okay, guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11588)|
| 3:13:10| So when I'm telling you that I'm a vessel, you're going to get used to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11590)|
| 3:13:14| you're going to see me, and you're going to know me, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11594)|
| 3:13:16| Because I'm tired of dodging bullets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11596)|
| 3:13:19| I'm scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11599)|
| 3:13:20| I'm upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11600)|
| 3:13:21| I'm worried for my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11601)|
| 3:13:23| I'm worried for my officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11603)|
| 3:13:24| They ain't all bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11604)|
| 3:13:26| We've got a lot of mess, but we've got mess on our side too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11606)|
| 3:13:28| So what I'm telling you is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11608)|
| 3:13:30| I'm not going to get no bullhorn and scream and yell and argue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11610)|
| 3:13:34| I'm begging, I'm asking, and I'm pleading for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11614)|
| 3:13:37| So if you want someone to be able to say, hey, what do we need to do, I'm here to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11617)|
| 3:13:42| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11622)|
| 3:13:43| I'm willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11623)|
| 3:13:44| I put my life on the line to do that, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11624)|
| 3:13:46| When I back my community and I go out here and I have the conversations that need to be had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11626)|
| 3:13:50| with the people that I can have the conversation with, I put my life on the line to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11630)|
| 3:13:58| But who am I if I sit back every day and I watch those babies go to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11638)|
| 3:14:03| and we watch them keep going and we just keep turning a blind eye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11643)|
| 3:14:07| The people who we need to help us are the people that we are shunning on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11647)|
| 3:14:11| You need us and we need you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11651)|
| 3:14:13| So as a parent, I'm telling you, apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11653)|
| 3:14:15| Tell them you dropped the ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11655)|
| 3:14:17| We all dropped the ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11657)|
| 3:14:19| When they felt like they had to go get that or when they came with it to the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11659)|
| 3:14:22| or when the parent didn't call and did things the right way, we dropped the ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11662)|
| 3:14:27| That's just the point, period, all the way around the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11667)|
| 3:14:30| We suck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11670)|
| 3:14:32| We owe that to them kids to tell them that we suck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11672)|
| 3:14:36| We owe them that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11676)|
| 3:14:38| And we owe this generation to put back accountability into them so we can have something in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11678)|
| 3:14:43| For they destroy everything that we put and built and the people before them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11683)|
| 3:14:47| and their ancestors and people who sacrificed their life and time beforehand to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11687)|
| 3:14:53| Because they're going to destroy it if we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11693)|
| 3:14:55| Accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11695)|
| 3:14:57| That's your why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11697)|

| 3:15:19| This is not an east side or west side problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11719)|
| 3:15:22| This is a Knoxville problem and I know you feel it because I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11722)|
| 3:15:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11725)|

| 3:16:45| Austin East students, faculty members, teachers, and their families are living through a nightmare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11805)|
| 3:16:51| as they watch child after child be slaughtered in the streets like animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11811)|
| 3:16:58| The traumatic events that have occurred over the course of mere months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11818)|
| 3:17:03| has created a mental health crisis in the area that the city has done nothing to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11823)|
| 3:17:10| While there are counselors on site at Austin East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11830)|
| 3:17:13| there are mere six counselors to the 643 students that we have attended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11833)|
| 3:17:19| and currently enrolled in the school, not including teachers and faculty members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11839)|
| 3:17:23| who have also lived through this traumatic experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11843)|
| 3:17:26| As a community, we are demanding at least a triple increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11846)|
| 3:17:29| in the number of counselors employed at Austin East High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11849)|
| 3:17:32| as well as immediate trauma care specialists on site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11852)|
| 3:17:36| to take care of the community during this tragic event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11856)|
| 3:17:41| We are also demanding complete transparency in the investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11861)|
| 3:17:46| of the murder of Anthony Thompson, Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11866)|

| 3:18:07| that KPD has at their disposal to be released to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11887)|

| 3:18:20| AE parents have also requested metal detectors at the front and back doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11900)|
| 3:18:24| as well as the assurance that the school is kept secure at all times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11904)|
| 3:18:29| for the safety of their children that KCS is supposed to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11909)|

| 3:18:37| and East Knoxville community members that will help them provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11917)|
| 3:18:40| stable home environments for AE students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11920)|
| 3:18:42| This isn't just on the Knoxville student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11922)|
| 3:18:46| This isn't just on the committee. This isn't just on the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11926)|
| 3:18:49| This is on us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11929)|
| 3:18:51| But you need to help us make ourselves better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11931)|
| 3:18:55| We also request immediate funding into programs like Project Grad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11935)|
| 3:19:00| in the interest of mentoring, tutoring, and paving the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11940)|
| 3:19:04| for students to be able to obtain higher education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11944)|
| 3:19:06| that helps them break the cycle of poverty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11946)|
| 3:19:08| that causes events like this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11948)|
| 3:19:13| Not pertinent to the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11953)|
| 3:19:15| but rather an appeal to state and city officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11955)|
| 3:19:18| we are also demanding funding into improving East Knoxville infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11958)|
| 3:19:23| bringing better jobs to the East Knoxville community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11963)|
| 3:19:26| with higher wages as well as trade school opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11966)|
| 3:19:28| and more funding into social work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11968)|
| 3:19:30| and outreach pertaining to mental and physical health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11970)|
| 3:19:34| welfare, and child care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11974)|
| 3:19:36| The East Knoxville community would also like to be included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11976)|
| 3:19:38| in the conversation on how to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11978)|
| 3:19:40| We're not asking you to do it on your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11980)|
| 3:19:42| We're just asking to be a part of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11982)|
| 3:19:44| We're asking to be given the opportunity to make this happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11984)|
| 3:19:49| to make our goals come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11989)|
| 3:19:52| We'd like to make a five- to ten-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11992)|
| 3:19:54| to break the cycle of poverty that ravages our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11994)|
| 3:19:57| Once and for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=11997)|
| 3:20:00| Our demands are reasonable and feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12000)|
| 3:20:02| and so a lack of action from the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12002)|
| 3:20:04| and City of Knoxville will be taken as intentional negligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12004)|
| 3:20:08| and will be combated aggressively by the East Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12008)|
| 3:20:12| I will be emailing a copy of this speech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12012)|
| 3:20:14| as well as the list of demands to each of the members of this Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12014)|
| 3:20:17| as well as our city and state representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12017)|
| 3:20:19| over the next few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12019)|
| 3:20:22| And I, as well as many community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12022)|
| 3:20:26| will continue to gather at these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12026)|
| 3:20:28| as well as any other public forum we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12028)|
| 3:20:31| to continue echoing these demands until they are finally implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12031)|
| 3:20:35| And so I end my time by asking the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12035)|
| 3:20:38| as well as all of the Knoxville community members in attendance right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12038)|
| 3:20:44| What Lives Matter!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12044)|

| 3:20:53| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12053)|
| 3:20:54| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12054)|
| 3:20:57| Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12057)|
| 3:20:59| I'd like to ask for us to suspend our rules related to Policy B180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12059)|
| 3:21:04| I think we've given a lot of attention to public forum around this issue of masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12064)|
| 3:21:08| and I think our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12068)|
| 3:21:09| if there's some that feel like they need to address us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12069)|
| 3:21:11| if there's other additional members that want to address us here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12071)|
| 3:21:15| related to the recent events at Austin East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12075)|
| 3:21:19| I'd like to allow for them to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12079)|
| 3:21:21| and I'm okay if we want to set a cap on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12081)|
| 3:21:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12083)|
| 3:21:25| Okay, we have a motion to suspend B180 to allow folks to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12085)|
| 3:21:32| Still have to give them a five minute time limit, but to add people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12092)|
| 3:21:34| To add people to public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12094)|
| 3:21:36| On that one issue, not other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12096)|
| 3:21:38| Regarding this one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12098)|
| 3:21:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12099)|
| 3:21:40| And Ms. Owen has seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12100)|
| 3:21:41| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12101)|
| 3:21:44| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12104)|
| 3:21:45| I'm confused because I thought he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12105)|
| 3:21:46| Is the issue face masks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12106)|
| 3:21:48| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12108)|
| 3:21:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12109)|
| 3:21:51| I only mentioned face masks to say we've given a lot of attention to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12111)|
| 3:21:57| and I think it's reasonable for us to say if there's others here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12117)|
| 3:22:00| that want to speak to the recent events at Austin East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12120)|
| 3:22:03| and in the community there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12123)|
| 3:22:04| that we should allow for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12124)|
| 3:22:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12127)|
| 3:22:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12128)|
| 3:22:10| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12130)|

| 3:22:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12138)|
| 3:22:19| I think the motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12139)|
| 3:22:21| Should we do a recess to get a list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12141)|
| 3:22:23| I mean, or at least give five minutes to get a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12143)|
| 3:22:27| That way it's not random.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12147)|
| 3:22:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12165)|
| 3:22:46| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12166)|
| 3:22:47| I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12167)|
| 3:22:48| I think if there's, you know, Ms. Babb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12168)|
| 3:22:50| you can just see if there's anybody that wants to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12170)|
| 3:22:53| Is there anyone that would like to speak that has not tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12173)|
| 3:22:57| Regarding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12177)|
| 3:22:59| Regarding the last issue that has been touched on about what's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12179)|
| 3:23:03| on in Austin East and the violence going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12183)|
| 3:23:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12189)|
| 3:23:12| And if you will come to the podium and say your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12192)|
| 3:23:14| and county of residence, and you'll have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=12194)|
