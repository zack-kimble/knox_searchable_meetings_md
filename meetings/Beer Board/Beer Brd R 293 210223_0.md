| 0:02:20| As you can see, today's meeting, like our meeting in January, is being held on Zoom. When I call the names of the businesses applying for their permit, please raise your hand in the Zoom session to speak, or you can dial star 9 on your phone and you can dial star 6 to mute or unmute yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210223?start=140)|
| 0:02:38| When you're called, please state your name clearly for the record and also give us your address. Applicants who are approved pending file documentation will need to bring their completed documents to the business tax office during regular business hours. As I'm chairing the meeting, other members will be making motions on the second district's items. Because our meeting is being held on Zoom, each vote will be conducted by roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210223?start=158)|
| 0:03:03| All right. So let's get started. First, we have an item in 4F, which is the Gosh Ethiopian restaurant. And they have requested to be postponed until our March 23rd meeting. So we can go ahead and deal with that on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210223?start=183)|
| 0:03:23| All right. I have a motion to postpone to the March 23rd meeting. I have a second. Any discussion? Hearing none, Mr. Johnson, roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210223?start=203)|

| 0:07:36| Now, there are two permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210223?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| There's both the on-off premise and the manufacturing for the 6 Emery Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210223?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| and there's also one for the 9937 Kingsville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210223?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| Exactly. I'm going to do those one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210223?start=465)|

| 0:08:05| and then ultimately the surrender of the existing permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210223?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210223?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| So, Mr. McLean, you have a few items still to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210223?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| Are you making progress on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210223?start=492)|

| 0:08:22| well, actually two weeks probably at most away from getting our CO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210223?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| and then that's when we can start getting fire inspection and beer inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210223?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| and all those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210223?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210223?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| And in this one you still have to surrender the existing permit, so you can work on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210223?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210223?start=515)|
