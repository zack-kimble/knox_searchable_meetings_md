| 2:32:58| So essentially, you would have multiple programs across the entire 16,000 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9178)|
| 2:33:04| So what we found is we have to standardize that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9184)|
| 2:33:07| If we allow different programs out there, we're elevating that risk of an interruption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9187)|
| 2:33:12| someone getting hurt or going to ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9192)|
| 2:33:15| Is TVA looking at any other, like, programs or something to maybe redo, replant trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9195)|
| 2:33:24| or allowing, you know, to work with organizations to get trees replanted that would meet the specs in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9204)|
| 2:33:33| We are currently looking at ways to, because obviously we understand that people don't like their trees cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9213)|
| 2:33:40| I don't want, as the gentleman mentioned earlier, I wouldn't want my trees cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9220)|
| 2:33:44| I will tell you that I have a 161 transmission line that crosses my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9224)|
| 2:33:48| It has Leland Cypress planted under it, and they are scheduled to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9228)|
| 2:33:53| And I'm not a popular person in the neighborhood, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9233)|
| 2:33:58| But recently what we're looking at is looking at some nonprofit organizations that we might be able to give to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9238)|
| 2:34:03| that has trees or, you know, lower-growing species that they can give out to property owners in conjunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9243)|
| 2:34:10| And this is just what we're just looking at at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9250)|
| 2:34:12| We haven't decided on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9252)|
| 2:34:14| A program that a property owner can go to when we're talking to them about removing a tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9254)|
| 2:34:20| they can look at it and say, look at an aerial view on a GPS application that can tell them the right place to put a tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9260)|
| 2:34:28| maybe outside the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9268)|
| 2:34:29| If it's outside the right way, it can be tall enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9269)|
| 2:34:31| This program will show them where to put it to help shade their home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9271)|
| 2:34:34| and it will show estimated cost savings for energy savings in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9274)|
| 2:34:39| So we're looking at trying to implement something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9279)|
| 2:34:43| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9285)|
| 2:34:46| I'll try to, I don't have any questions really, but I'll try to hopefully add something that hasn't been said before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9286)|
| 2:34:54| If Ms. Henry said the trees were cut two and a half weeks ago, I went out there, I guess, three weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9294)|
| 2:34:59| a couple of days before the trees were cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9299)|
| 2:35:02| Ms. Shiverstein had called me, and four or five other people were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9302)|
| 2:35:06| and she had the agreement there about where they had spent $1,000 to trim up a tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9306)|
| 2:35:11| and it would be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9311)|
| 2:35:13| Basically, the backyard would be left intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9313)|
| 2:35:16| And the trees were, I don't know if they were marked or had a ribbon on them or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9316)|
| 2:35:20| but the trees that were doomed to be cut down were clearly marked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9320)|
| 2:35:25| And I was just astounded at some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9325)|
| 2:35:27| They were so far removed from the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9327)|
| 2:35:30| And, again, I'm no expert on surveying or tree damage or anything of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9330)|
| 2:35:35| But, I mean, the crepe myrtles of some of these plants, it would have, in my humble opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9335)|
| 2:35:39| would have taken a tornado to pick them up and throw them into the wires, which is conceivable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9339)|
| 2:35:43| but it's very unlikely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9343)|
| 2:35:45| Again, I guess what bothers me is the, I think, to me, I don't want to say clear-cutting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9345)|
| 2:35:52| just the cutting is excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9352)|
| 2:35:55| And what I'm told by Ms. Henry and others is the unresponsive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9355)|
| 2:36:01| and adversely abrasive attitude with which they've been dealt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9361)|
| 2:36:06| I mean, they never get their phone calls returned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9366)|
| 2:36:08| Maybe they do now since there's been some TV and newspaper stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9368)|
| 2:36:11| but they never get phone calls returned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9371)|
| 2:36:15| And so that's what really bothers me about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9375)|
| 2:36:17| I know we're just a kind of commission, and we're dealing with a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9377)|
| 2:36:21| we're making a request of a massive federal bureaucracy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9381)|
| 2:36:24| just like if we requested something of, what was those acronyms, FERC, NERC, or EPA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9384)|
| 2:36:29| or IRS, you know, that's getting filed in 13 real fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9389)|
| 2:36:33| And I just, you know, this is still a democracy where, you know, of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9393)|
| 2:36:40| and this is a, you know, it's a federal agency that's created by Congress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9400)|
| 2:36:45| And so I think that that's what bothers me, that there's an unresponsiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9405)|
| 2:36:50| And I am in great sympathy with the people that have had their trees cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9410)|
| 2:36:55| And I hope that TVA, again, it won't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9415)|
| 2:36:58| I think it's going to take a lot more than Knox County Commission of City of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9418)|
| 2:37:01| Knox County City Council issuing resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9421)|
| 2:37:04| It's going to take dozens, probably throughout the seven southern states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9424)|
| 2:37:08| from many other commissions and councils and who knows what, mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9428)|
| 2:37:13| to get any real, I think, to get this seriously looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9433)|
| 2:37:16| But, again, in my humble opinion, it's an excessive way to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9436)|
| 2:37:20| and just whack people's property under the possibility that it may be a power outage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9440)|
| 2:37:28| because of some vegetation that's way over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9448)|
| 2:37:32| Again, I'm not an expert on what could happen if storms come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9452)|
| 2:37:36| but I totally support the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9456)|
| 2:37:38| I did see it firsthand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9458)|
| 2:37:39| I went and I guess Mr. Silverstein called me and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9459)|
| 2:37:42| the trees are gone or they're going today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9462)|
| 2:37:43| There's armed guards out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9463)|
| 2:37:44| And I was sort of in shock that armed guards had the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9464)|
| 2:37:48| I guess they thought they were going to be attacked by Ms. Henry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9468)|
| 2:37:50| She is pretty intimidating at about four foot nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9470)|
| 2:37:53| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9473)|
| 2:37:54| But, anyway, I don't mean to make this humorous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9474)|
| 2:37:57| but it's a serious matter to me and I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9477)|
| 2:38:00| And thank you, Jeff, for putting it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9480)|
| 2:38:03| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9483)|
| 2:38:05| Hey, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9485)|
| 2:38:06| I guess I bring a kind of unique perspective to this in that I spent the time prior to being on this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9486)|
| 2:38:14| on the Board of Directors of Knoxville Utilities Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9494)|
| 2:38:18| And toward the end, I think I actually ended up only with one meeting with Mr. Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9498)|
| 2:38:24| The right one I was leaving is when KUB was getting involved in this dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9504)|
| 2:38:28| about its tree trimming process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9508)|
| 2:38:32| I also bring another unique perspective in that I work at Oak Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9512)|
| 2:38:38| at this place, Neutron,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9518)|
| 2:38:39| so we have a direct line from you all's Kingston line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9519)|
| 2:38:43| And if we get a dip of 15 out of 60 cycles, it shuts us off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9523)|
| 2:38:50| Twenty shuts off our helium processor and we're down for days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9530)|
| 2:38:56| We could potentially lose a lot of taxpayer money, millions of dollars to bring that system back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9536)|
| 2:39:05| And every hour we're off, it costs a significant amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9545)|
| 2:39:09| So it's for that reason that I'm not going to support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9549)|
| 2:39:16| With that said, I've warned you all, and I'll just be blunt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9556)|
| 2:39:21| I've warned you all about high-handed responses, aggressive approaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9561)|
| 2:39:30| failure to properly communicate with citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9570)|
| 2:39:34| You're big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9574)|
| 2:39:35| You're really big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9575)|
| 2:39:37| But you will get in a world of hurt if you keep this process that you're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9577)|
| 2:39:46| This is the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9586)|
| 2:39:47| This is the way it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9587)|
| 2:39:48| Because even in the letter, it says the law is 200K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9588)|
| 2:39:52| I think we got to the end of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9592)|
| 2:39:54| You guys are going above and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9594)|
| 2:39:55| I applaud that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9595)|
| 2:39:57| But don't just say, it's coming down the pike, so we're going to go 100K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9597)|
| 2:40:01| You know, it comes off as heavy-handed today in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9601)|
| 2:40:08| If you have compelling reasons, I think you went on to explain those compelling reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9608)|
| 2:40:13| what can happen at 161.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9613)|
| 2:40:15| I think you need to take that approach instead of saying, we're going to do it, it's all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9615)|
| 2:40:20| we passed the law in 93 and 2003, whatever year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9620)|
| 2:40:25| You know, again, I'm not going to support the resolution because I understand what you're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9625)|
| 2:40:30| and I understand the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9630)|
| 2:40:34| But I just really, you know, piggyback on what Commissioner Schaaf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9634)|
| 2:40:39| you all can do a much better job communicating with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9639)|
| 2:40:43| I know it takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9643)|
| 2:40:44| I know it takes your resources away from your day job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9644)|
| 2:40:48| But these are the people that you're the rate payers or the folks that you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9648)|
| 2:40:52| through a proxy, are your customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9652)|
| 2:40:58| I'm sure the other may not make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9658)|
| 2:41:00| But, you know, you get a couple of counties like Knox involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9660)|
| 2:41:04| and I guarantee these folks aren't going to go away and you get a snowball effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9664)|
| 2:41:08| So, again, I don't want to get too preachy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9668)|
| 2:41:10| but I do want to preach to you a little bit in that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9670)|
| 2:41:14| I think if you all keep on with this, you'll all be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9674)|
| 2:41:18| You all will be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9678)|
| 2:41:19| You'll have the law behind you, but you'll be wrong in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9679)|
| 2:41:24| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9684)|
| 2:41:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9687)|
| 2:41:28| I just want to say my grandfather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9688)|
| 2:41:30| and father both spent their entire careers in electrical power generation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9690)|
| 2:41:34| and distribution and from underground to overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9694)|
| 2:41:38| So I get all this, too, about safety, not just for the people who live close by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9698)|
| 2:41:42| but also the people who have to go out and repair the lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9702)|
| 2:41:47| That's a serious concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9707)|
| 2:41:48| But I also am of the feeling that this is just a little too draconian in its breadth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9708)|
| 2:41:59| And also I had a question about the spraying that's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9719)|
| 2:42:04| Exactly which chemicals are you using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9724)|
| 2:42:06| and are you notifying the homeowners that you're spraying chemicals onto their property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9726)|
| 2:42:11| Are you offering that as an option or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9731)|
| 2:42:15| It's not an option, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9735)|
| 2:42:16| It's part of our process and we use only EPA approved herbicides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9736)|
| 2:42:21| And do you have and I'm also agree with what Ed has said and also Sam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9741)|
| 2:42:29| do you have or would you consider convening any kind of advisory board that would give your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9749)|
| 2:42:36| the people who ultimately pay your salaries and pay for this power a voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9756)|
| 2:42:41| and some input into developing these processes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9761)|
| 2:42:46| No one is suggesting that you allow trees to grow up anywhere close to power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9766)|
| 2:42:53| That's not at all what anyone is suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9773)|
| 2:42:57| But trying to smooth the pathway, it might go a little easier if some of the stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9777)|
| 2:43:06| were involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9786)|
| 2:43:10| So is that something that you all either already have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9790)|
| 2:43:13| or is that something that you would consider in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9793)|
| 2:43:16| I'm really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9796)|
| 2:43:17| I don't hold the position to answer that question for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9797)|
| 2:43:23| Mr. Ornby, did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9803)|
| 2:43:26| Yeah, I actually want to make a substitute motion to this resolution to add that MPC be instructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9806)|
| 2:43:37| to make the information aware to the developers as well as any businesses that are going to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9817)|
| 2:43:45| to suggestions on trees that they get with TVA to find out what is good vegetation for borderlines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9825)|
| 2:43:53| and so that we don't have to go through this when any other new buildings come in or new subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9833)|
| 2:43:59| So I'd like to make that substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9839)|
| 2:44:02| So the substitute is to just add the language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9842)|
| 2:44:05| You just amended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9845)|
| 2:44:06| You amended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9846)|
| 2:44:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9847)|
| 2:44:09| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9849)|
| 2:44:12| Thank you, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9852)|
| 2:44:13| I was going to suggest the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9853)|
| 2:44:14| That's exactly what we need to do on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9854)|
| 2:44:17| Sam, I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9857)|
| 2:44:20| I really appreciate what you were coming from and what you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9860)|
| 2:44:23| And I was noticing that as you were talking to the TVA delegation and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9863)|
| 2:44:27| and you were right on and they just looked at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9867)|
| 2:44:30| I never saw one nod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9870)|
| 2:44:31| Yeah, we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9871)|
| 2:44:32| I just gave you the stare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9872)|
| 2:44:35| You know, you have to remember that you're public servants also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9875)|
| 2:44:40| Ms. Henry, would you please come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9880)|
| 2:44:41| Mr. Manning, would you come to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9881)|
| 2:44:49| Mr. Manning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9889)|
| 2:44:52| No, Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9892)|
| 2:44:53| I thought this was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9893)|
| 2:44:54| He wrote the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9894)|
| 2:44:57| Yeah, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9897)|
| 2:44:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9898)|
| 2:44:59| What's your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9899)|
| 2:45:00| Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9900)|
| 2:45:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9903)|
| 2:45:05| This lady here said that she spent a lot of money cleaning her trees up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9905)|
| 2:45:13| You said that was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9913)|
| 2:45:14| The next year you came in and you cut them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9914)|
| 2:45:18| I think you owe that lady some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9918)|
| 2:45:22| I'd like to know what you're going to do about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9922)|
| 2:45:26| She's standing right there beside you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9926)|
| 2:45:28| Yes, I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9928)|
| 2:45:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9929)|
| 2:45:30| Commissioner, that's a very valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9930)|
| 2:45:33| It's about doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9933)|
| 2:45:35| If I might respond, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9935)|
| 2:45:38| It is about doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9938)|
| 2:45:39| In fact, three years ago or whatever distance of time it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9939)|
| 2:45:43| we wanted to remove the trees at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| But because she persisted and that's her right to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9945)|
| 2:45:49| that she wanted to keep the trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9949)|
| 2:45:50| we came up with that agreement, which basically said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9950)|
| 2:45:53| and I don't have the agreement in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9953)|
| 2:45:55| that she was able to trim certain trees to the specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9955)|
| 2:46:00| That was good for that year only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9960)|
| 2:46:01| and it's clearly stated in the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9961)|
| 2:46:05| As far as owing her money, I'm not the correct person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9965)|
| 2:46:08| but I'm more than happy to take that back to the appropriate people at TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9968)|
| 2:46:11| and let them know your concerns and that of Ms. Henry's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9971)|
| 2:46:15| See, and that's what I'm getting at, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9975)|
| 2:46:17| You should have at least offered this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9977)|
| 2:46:18| You heard this last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9978)|
| 2:46:20| She cut her trees even farther| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9980)|
| 2:46:22| than what she was even asked to be cutting the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9982)|
| 2:46:25| That's just the type of public service that we're trying to look for out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9985)|
| 2:46:29| is that, you know, Ms. Henry, we'll see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9989)|
| 2:46:33| You've offered no sympathy to her whatsoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9993)|
| 2:46:36| or trying to reach out that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| we'll try to do better in the future or we'll try to reimburse you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9998)|
| 2:46:41| You're not going to promise her anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10001)|
| 2:46:43| But I just sort of like what Sam McKenzie was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10003)|
| 2:46:47| just pretty heavy-handed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10007)|
| 2:46:49| So, Ms. Henry, I'm sorry for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10009)|
| 2:46:51| And guys at TVA, and I used to work for TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10011)|
| 2:46:54| guys, you all can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10014)|
| 2:46:56| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10016)|
| 2:46:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10019)|
| 2:47:01| I guess, Mr. Robinson, I guess this is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10021)|
| 2:47:05| To the issue there at Summit in the Leland Cypress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10025)|
| 2:47:11| what is, I don't know what the height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10031)|
| 2:47:15| what the maximum height of a Leland Cypress is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10035)|
| 2:47:17| which you all do, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10037)|
| 2:47:20| I think we'd defer to Jason if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10040)|
| 2:47:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10043)|
| 2:47:24| I'm sorry, Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10044)|
| 2:47:25| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10045)|
| 2:47:26| I saw in an article earlier this morning where there was mentioned 15 to 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10046)|
| 2:47:31| And I think they were looking at somebody from UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10051)|
| 2:47:33| We also looked at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10053)|
| 2:47:35| And you'll find on UT's website that it can reach 35 and 40 foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10055)|
| 2:47:39| if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10059)|
| 2:47:41| So this transmission line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10061)|
| 2:47:42| I don't even believe in this particular instance is 40 foot off the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10062)|
| 2:47:45| I haven't been out there to measure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10065)|
| 2:47:47| My right-of-way specialist has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10067)|
| 2:47:50| But Leland Cypress can get at all types of different ranges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10070)|
| 2:47:54| but many of them or most of them are at a height that can become a threat to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10074)|
| 2:47:59| transmission line, and not from a grow-in only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10079)|
| 2:48:01| even from falling in or from the conductors or the trees blowing together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10081)|
| 2:48:05| So that's the reason for this choice also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10085)|
| 2:48:08| And that's one of the reasons for the 15-foot mature height rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10088)|
| 2:48:11| There are plenty of species that we offer on our website that property owners can choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10091)|
| 2:48:16| and call us and talk to us about it and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10096)|
| 2:48:18| does this fit within, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10098)|
| 2:48:20| it can be compatible within the transmission system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10100)|
| 2:48:23| And Leland Cypress is not one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10103)|
| 2:48:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10105)|
| 2:48:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10106)|
| 2:48:27| I have a document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10107)|
| 2:48:29| If you're interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10109)|
| 2:48:30| I can pass out to commission from the UT Agriculture Extension Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10110)|
| 2:48:34| It's the document that Jason referred to earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10114)|
| 2:48:37| showing that the height at maturity can be somewhere between 35 and 40 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10117)|
| 2:48:41| if commission is interested in seeing that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10121)|
| 2:48:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10123)|
| 2:48:44| And I'm going to make the comments that I have would be parallel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10124)|
| 2:48:48| to what some of my colleagues have just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10128)|
| 2:48:51| It seems like communication is somewhat lacking for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10131)|
| 2:48:56| Most of the people that are around these easements are really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10136)|
| 2:49:04| they're not concerned with height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10144)|
| 2:49:06| They're concerned with breadth and border issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10146)|
| 2:49:11| That's all they're wanting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10151)|
| 2:49:13| And so somehow it seems, and I know TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10153)|
| 2:49:17| I know a lot of people in TVA that are very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10157)|
| 2:49:20| some of my starting the environmental issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10160)|
| 2:49:24| I'm the tree hugger here on this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10164)|
| 2:49:27| Well, and Amy is, yes, she's a little bit of a tree hugger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10167)|
| 2:49:31| But it really started with TVA's programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10171)|
| 2:49:35| And so I appreciate a lot of people in TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10175)|
| 2:49:40| that have an environmental heart and conscience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10180)|
| 2:49:44| and want to do good things from that perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10184)|
| 2:49:50| So it just seems like there's some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10190)|
| 2:49:54| maybe you can take that back as a way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10194)|
| 2:49:57| how can we communicate better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10197)|
| 2:49:59| How can we get out this information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10199)|
| 2:50:01| People are just really wanting to border,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10201)|
| 2:50:04| have visual borders and corridors that are just more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10204)|
| 2:50:11| you know, more aesthetically pleasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10211)|
| 2:50:14| than just nothing under those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10214)|
| 2:50:17| And so I think those can be accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10217)|
| 2:50:20| And so maybe that's something that could be productive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10220)|
| 2:50:23| in this dialogue, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10223)|
| 2:50:25| And I want to recognize Ms. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10225)|
| 2:50:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10229)|
| 2:50:30| I didn't mean to jump up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10230)|
| 2:50:32| Margo Klein, 8845 Ebenezer Oaks Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10232)|
| 2:50:35| The reason I'm coming forward is because I was the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10235)|
| 2:50:37| who was quoted in the paper this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10237)|
| 2:50:39| and it was a misquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10239)|
| 2:50:41| And at 2 o'clock in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10241)|
| 2:50:42| I was sending an e-mail to Betty Bean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10242)|
| 2:50:44| the author of that story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10244)|
| 2:50:46| And I got an oops, sorry about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10246)|
| 2:50:48| this morning back from Betty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10248)|
| 2:50:50| And then I sent another e-mail and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10250)|
| 2:50:52| can you correct that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10252)|
| 2:50:53| I know you can't in print,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10253)|
| 2:50:54| but can you put a correction on the website version?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10254)|
| 2:50:59| Because I actually have Leland cypresses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10259)|
| 2:51:01| and I think they're probably 30 feet tall in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10261)|
| 2:51:04| So I know real well that they can grow beyond 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10264)|
| 2:51:08| 15 to 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10268)|
| 2:51:09| And I had told her 35 to 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10269)|
| 2:51:12| and I had referenced the UT Agricultural Extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10272)|
| 2:51:15| publication they just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10275)|
| 2:51:17| And the reason that came up is because about three weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10277)|
| 2:51:22| Mr. Nance from TVA wrote a letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10282)|
| 2:51:25| which I know you all have a copy of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10285)|
| 2:51:27| to the owner of the Summit Medical Property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10287)|
| 2:51:30| And in it states that Leland cypresses grow to between 60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10290)|
| 2:51:34| and 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10294)|
| 2:51:36| And I believe someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10296)|
| 2:51:38| a member of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10298)|
| 2:51:39| spoke with Mr. Nance and clarified that he was using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10299)|
| 2:51:44| figures from Clemson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10304)|
| 2:51:46| And so the questionnaire is apples and oranges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10306)|
| 2:51:50| and, yes, they can grow to 35 to 40 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10310)|
| 2:51:53| but they cannot grow to 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10313)|
| 2:51:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10315)|
| 2:51:56| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10316)|
| 2:51:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10319)|
| 2:52:03| I think the biggest issue here has been mentioned a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10323)|
| 2:52:07| times is communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10327)|
| 2:52:10| While TVA or anybody else has a legal right to do things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10330)|
| 2:52:18| there is also a moral way of doing them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10338)|
| 2:52:22| and that is taking into consideration those that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10342)|
| 2:52:25| getting done, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10345)|
| 2:52:28| And I think that sometimes, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10348)|
| 2:52:32| I've been seeing them out in my neighborhood with their little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10352)|
| 2:52:34| crawlers that go along and choose everything up in sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10354)|
| 2:52:38| But look at it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10358)|
| 2:52:40| If you and I share a property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10360)|
| 2:52:44| and for some reason you even mistakenly come across my line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10364)|
| 2:52:48| and cut a tree on my property, if I take you to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10368)|
| 2:52:53| I can take that pine tree or whatever it is and make it into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10373)|
| 2:52:56| some of the finest furniture that was ever made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10376)|
| 2:52:59| make it worth $10,000, $20,000 for one tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10379)|
| 2:53:03| These folks are getting nothing but heartaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10383)|
| 2:53:07| At least have some compassion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10387)|
| 2:53:09| I guarantee you one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10389)|
| 2:53:11| If they come on my property with weapons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10391)|
| 2:53:13| they better be prepared to use them because I have them, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10393)|
| 2:53:19| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10399)|
| 2:53:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10402)|
| 2:53:23| I can't follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10403)|
| 2:53:27| You've got traps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10407)|
| 2:53:29| I've got a question about procedure here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10409)|
| 2:53:31| Is Commissioner Owenby's motion amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10411)|
| 2:53:36| Do we have to vote on that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10416)|
| 2:53:41| No, in the second degree to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10421)|
| 2:53:42| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10422)|
| 2:53:47| I need to speak to that then, and that in its singular view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10427)|
| 2:53:52| I'm not in favor of a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10432)|
| 2:53:55| One, that's putting a financial impact on MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10435)|
| 2:54:02| and I think that's what we may be doing if we're asking them to change how they map and note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10442)|
| 2:54:09| And so we're asking them to take on a task, which may cost them some money to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10449)|
| 2:54:17| And the second thing is it will be then interjecting MPC in between Knox County and TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10457)|
| 2:54:27| and these property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10467)|
| 2:54:29| And I'm not going to, I don't think I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10469)|
| 2:54:34| I'm really against us being brought into the fight because this is TVA and 16,000 miles of high line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10474)|
| 2:54:42| not just Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10482)|
| 2:54:44| So if we're going to speak of financial impact or interjecting our mapping into how high lines are maintained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10484)|
| 2:54:54| I would have voted no on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10494)|
| 2:54:58| No, it's not to make a financial burden on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10498)|
| 2:55:02| It's just to make the information available to the people that come up there and ask for developments to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10502)|
| 2:55:08| or it's just a number on a website, and I don't think that's, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10508)|
| 2:55:15| If it's not something MPC is doing currently, if currently developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10515)|
| 2:55:20| and people plotting for subdivisions, then they probably need to be dealing directly with TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10520)|
| 2:55:28| So I don't think that I want to see MPC either answering the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10528)|
| 2:55:34| or bringing forth information that might, as we see right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10534)|
| 2:55:40| we've got a property owner with a document with TVA and I don't want to see us involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10540)|
| 2:55:51| I was just, it was a way of opening communication between the builder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10551)|
| 2:55:56| or the private citizen, for that matter, with TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10556)|
| 2:56:00| It's just a suggestion and just like this resolution, TVA doesn't have to listen to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10560)|
| 2:56:06| It's just a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10566)|
| 2:56:07| I mean, it's asking them to revise their policy doesn't mean they have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10567)|
| 2:56:12| Right, and I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10572)|
| 2:56:15| In fact, I could have, I may have spoken at a later point here about TVA's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10575)|
| 2:56:21| as Commissioner Anders has said, this is a PR fiasco or as, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10581)|
| 2:56:31| everyone that spoke to it really has brought that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10591)|
| 2:56:34| That is the underlying theme that everyone has brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10594)|
| 2:56:38| But with the, what I view to be interjecting us into the fray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10598)|
| 2:56:47| then I can't go along with the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10607)|
| 2:56:51| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10611)|
| 2:56:53| Just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10613)|
| 2:56:56| Commissioner Braun said what I consider a good idea, and that is, does it exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10616)|
| 2:57:02| the advisory council, tree board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10622)|
| 2:57:08| If that doesn't, could you all just get us some information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10628)|
| 2:57:11| I know you can't commit to anything, but do you have one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10631)|
| 2:57:14| If not, could you take that information back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10634)|
| 2:57:16| and maybe give us a response in terms of I've considered it and go fly a kite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10636)|
| 2:57:21| or, yes, we'll consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10641)|
| 2:57:23| Yeah, we can take that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10643)|
| 2:57:25| And, no, we do not have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10645)|
| 2:57:27| I do want to respond to the communication question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10647)|
| 2:57:30| because that seems to be the questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10650)|
| 2:57:34| We did contact Ms. Henry over a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10654)|
| 2:57:36| to let her know that we were going to have to be removing these trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10656)|
| 2:57:39| and then subsequently contacted her again about two weeks before we did this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10659)|
| 2:57:45| Also, the Summit Medical Center we contacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10665)|
| 2:57:47| We make every effort to contact individual property owners at least two weeks in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10667)|
| 2:57:52| More often than that, it's in advance of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10672)|
| 2:57:56| We don't contact property owners that aren't associated with that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10676)|
| 2:58:01| to discuss that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10681)|
| 2:58:03| Some have requested that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10683)|
| 2:58:05| But we talk to the individual property owner themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10685)|
| 2:58:08| when it pertains to their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10688)|
| 2:58:10| Also, we went to the Knoxville News Sentinel to try to get our story out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10690)|
| 2:58:15| This has been months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10695)|
| 2:58:17| We went to elected officials in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10697)|
| 2:58:20| and met with them to talk about what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10700)|
| 2:58:22| So we are making a large effort to communicate what we're doing and why we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10702)|
| 2:58:28| And in this forum, it's a short forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10708)|
| 2:58:30| It's difficult to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10710)|
| 2:58:31| It's much easier to do that on a one-on-one basis with a property owner or elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10711)|
| 2:58:36| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10716)|
| 2:58:37| What is the amendment again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10717)|
| 2:58:39| I had some of the same concerns that Commissioner Wright did about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10719)|
| 2:58:43| Are we, you know, are we starting to put an unnecessary burden there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10723)|
| 2:58:48| Because I'm very supportive of what we had, but I don't want us to get into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10728)|
| 2:58:53| First of all, I want to hear what the amendment was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10733)|
| 2:58:56| If you restate the amendment, Mr. Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10736)|
| 2:59:02| Just that we add that MPC make available to builders or residents the contact number for TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10742)|
| 2:59:12| just to for communication purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10752)|
| 2:59:17| I don't see a dollar figure going to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10757)|
| 2:59:21| We're already in the middle of this anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10761)|
| 2:59:23| I mean, that's why we're up here talking about this for the last two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10763)|
| 2:59:27| So that's the reason I said the city is doing something similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10767)|
| 2:59:33| The mayor is already and some of the city council are going to bring that up on a resolution on theirs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10773)|
| 2:59:37| that makes MPC part of the process so that we don't go through this with unnecessary trees being planted in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10777)|
| 2:59:46| So, really, all this amendment is, is that we just the MPC provides a telephone number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10786)|
| 2:59:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10791)|
| 2:59:52| Mr. Donaldson, do you want to weigh in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10792)|
| 2:59:54| I see you back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10794)|
| 2:59:55| Could you assure us that there will not be financial implications and that this is something that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10795)|
| 3:00:00| Or even a large administrative burden or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10800)|
| 3:00:03| But the terminology that was used a moment ago was mapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10803)|
| 3:00:09| Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10809)|
| 3:00:12| Yes, you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10812)|
| 3:00:14| Jeff, you just put the word what species, what species of trees can be in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10814)|
| 3:00:19| Mr. Donaldson, could you give us your name and address of the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10819)|
| 3:00:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10821)|
| 3:00:22| And address this for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10822)|
| 3:00:23| Mark Donaldson, Director of the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10823)|
| 3:00:28| I heard with great interest that we're being thrown into this mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10828)|
| 3:00:34| As you're aware, we administer the planting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10834)|
| 3:00:37| And in doing that, come across easements of all kinds at all times and make notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10837)|
| 3:00:43| And if we were provided with information and contact numbers, we could make that a part of the planting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10843)|
| 3:00:51| When I first heard Commissioner Owenby's amendment, it sounded to me as if we were to work with developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10851)|
| 3:00:59| on noting the proper maintenance and tree planting within TVA easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10859)|
| 3:01:07| That would be a burden, not a large burden, but it's a normal part of our planting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10867)|
| 3:01:14| And if we're provided with enough materials on the front end, we can make that available to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10874)|
| 3:01:19| But that's different than simply making available a TVA contact person or number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10879)|
| 3:01:27| It's very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10887)|
| 3:01:29| We can do this in a number of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10889)|
| 3:01:32| Putting together a brochure on proper tree planting methods within easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10892)|
| 3:01:38| coming up with a note to place on plats, any number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10898)|
| 3:01:45| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10905)|
| 3:01:46| I withdraw that amendment because it's not what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10906)|
| 3:01:50| If that's what I said, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10910)|
| 3:01:52| That was not what I meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10912)|
| 3:01:53| So I'll just remove it and we'll go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10913)|
| 3:01:56| So the motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10916)|
| 3:01:59| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=10919)|
